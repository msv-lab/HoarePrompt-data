The execution of `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 2, `k` is 4 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
