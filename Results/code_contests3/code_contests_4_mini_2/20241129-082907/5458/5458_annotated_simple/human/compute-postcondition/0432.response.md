Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `m` at least 2, `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `s` at least 2, and `k` equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [1][3][1] to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated but remains invalid due to `k - j`, with `j` being greater than `k`.***
