According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for `k` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased to 3.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**.
