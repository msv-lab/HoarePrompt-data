Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
