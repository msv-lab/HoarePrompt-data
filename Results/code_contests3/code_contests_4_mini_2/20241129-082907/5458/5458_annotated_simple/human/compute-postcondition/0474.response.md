Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the `dp` list. If `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged for this iteration.***
