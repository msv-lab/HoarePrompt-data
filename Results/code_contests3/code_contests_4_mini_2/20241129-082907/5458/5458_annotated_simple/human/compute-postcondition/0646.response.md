The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
