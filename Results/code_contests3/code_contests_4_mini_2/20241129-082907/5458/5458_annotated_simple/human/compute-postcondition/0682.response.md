The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variable `k` is 1, so `k - j` will depend on the value of `j`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` can take values from 0 to `m - 1`. 

The previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not explicitly defined, but it is required for the calculation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on these conditions.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
