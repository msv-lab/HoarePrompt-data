Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `mod` is 100000, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the dp table is updated without affecting the current state. If `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo 100000.***
