The code snippet updates the `dp` array based on the index calculations. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the least significant bit of `i + 1`, resulting in either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The value `j + 1` increments `j` by 1, and `k` remains unchanged at 1.

Previous values were:
- `i` is greater than or equal to 1 (thus `i + 1` is at least 2)
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3
- `k` is 1

The state of `dp` is updated, but we do not know its previous values, as it's stated to be updated based on conditions throughout iterations. However, the operation is clear: the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will take the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
