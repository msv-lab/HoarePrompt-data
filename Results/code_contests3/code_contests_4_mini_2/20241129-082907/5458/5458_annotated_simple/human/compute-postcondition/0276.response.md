According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` is `S`, `dp` contains updated values based on all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `j` is 2.**
