Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least `s`, `i` is 0, and for each `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is either set to 1 (if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for at least one iteration) or updated based on the values from the previous indices of `dp` modulo `mod`.**
