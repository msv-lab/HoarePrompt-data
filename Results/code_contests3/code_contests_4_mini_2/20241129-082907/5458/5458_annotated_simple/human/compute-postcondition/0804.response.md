The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most inner loop. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most inner loop.**
