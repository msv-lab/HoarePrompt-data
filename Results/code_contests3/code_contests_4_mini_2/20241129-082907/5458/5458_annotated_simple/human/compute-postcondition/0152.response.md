Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions for all iterations of the loop, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.***
