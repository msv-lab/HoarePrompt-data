According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, because the range function needs a valid endpoint to generate values. 

The provided state indicates that `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, which should be sufficient to ensure that `s` is at least 1, given that it is stated that `M` is a positive integer and `S` is assumed to be related to those constraints.

The current state mentions that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, which are not directly relevant to the loop's initialization but are part of the broader context. The loop will start with `k` being initialized to 1, which is also reflected in the range specified.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to confirm that `s` is indeed at least 1. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1.**
