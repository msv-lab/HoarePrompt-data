Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp` contains updated values based on all iterations of the loop, `j` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
