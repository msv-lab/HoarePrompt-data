According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `S`. The variable `k` will take on values starting from 1 up to and including `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`. Since the loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next value, which would be 2 in this case.

Thus, if the loop is to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `S`. Since `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` must be less than or equal to `S`. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `S` (i.e., `k` is 2)**
