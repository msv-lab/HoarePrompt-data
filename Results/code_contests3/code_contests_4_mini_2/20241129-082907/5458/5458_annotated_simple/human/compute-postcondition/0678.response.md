In the given code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Here, `i + 1 & 1` will toggle between 0 and 1 based on the value of `i`, and `j + 1` indicates the next index in the second dimension of the `dp` array.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in:
   - If `i` is 0, then `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1.
   - If `i` is 1, then `i + 1` is 2, and `2 & 1` is 0.

2. Therefore, the indices for the `dp` array will be determined by the value of `i`:
   - For `i = 0`: `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]`
   - For `i = 1`: `dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k]`

3. The values of `j` and `k` are not altered and remain as they were.

4. The output state reflects the possible assignments based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` must be at least 1, `k` is 1; and the assignment depends on the value of `i`: dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k] if `i` is 0, or dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k] if `i` is 1.**
