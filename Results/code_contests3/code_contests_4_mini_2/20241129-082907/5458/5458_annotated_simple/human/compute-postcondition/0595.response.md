The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
