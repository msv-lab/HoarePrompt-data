The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop we are in and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a list of lists, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
