Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. The variables `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
