According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop executes for values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. Since `s` is at least 4, the loop will still be valid for `k` equal to 3.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4**.
