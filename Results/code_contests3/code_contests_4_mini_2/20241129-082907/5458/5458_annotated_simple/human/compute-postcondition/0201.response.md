The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Given the initial state, since `N` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3, we can calculate `i + 1 & 1`, which will result in 0 (because `1 & 1` equals 1, and `0` is the result for `i + 1`). Thus, the value at `dp[0][4][3]` (since `j + 1` is 4) will take the value from `dp[0][3][3]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `dp[0][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][3]`.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `dp[0][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][3]**
