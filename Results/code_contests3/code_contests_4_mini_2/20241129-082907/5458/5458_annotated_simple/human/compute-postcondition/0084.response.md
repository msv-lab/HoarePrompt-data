Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `dp` has been updated based on the loop's logic, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` accordingly.***
