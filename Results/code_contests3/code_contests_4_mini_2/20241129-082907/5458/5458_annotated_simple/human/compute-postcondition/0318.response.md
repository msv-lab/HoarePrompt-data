According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current state indicates that `dp` is a 2-dimensional list, but it does not provide information about `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is [[0], [0]], for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
