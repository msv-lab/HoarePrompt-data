Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and the `dp` array is updated such that if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][2][k - 2] % mod`, with specific behavior influenced by the value of `dp[i & 1][2][-1]`.***
