The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values. 

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions for all iterations of the loop, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
