The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
