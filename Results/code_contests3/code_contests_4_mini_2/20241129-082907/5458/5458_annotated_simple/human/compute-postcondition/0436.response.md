The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is evaluated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given:
- `i` is equal to 2
- `j` is equal to 2
- `k` is equal to 2

First, we calculate `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` equals `3`
- `3 & 1` equals `1` (since bitwise AND of `3` (binary `11`) and `1` (binary `01`) results in `1` (binary `01`))

Next, we calculate `j + 1`:
- `j + 1` equals `3`

Now we can substitute these values into the expression:
- The left-hand side becomes `dp[1][3][2]`
- The right-hand side becomes `dp[1][2][2]`

Thus, we are assigning the value of `dp[1][2][2]` to `dp[1][3][2]`.

The output state reflects the assignment made to `dp`, and since other variables remain unchanged, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `k` equal to 2.**
