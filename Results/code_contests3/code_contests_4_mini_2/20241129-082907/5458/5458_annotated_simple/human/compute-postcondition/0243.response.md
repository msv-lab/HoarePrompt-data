According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `M`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `M`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `M`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `M + 1` which is greater than `M`. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `k` is equal to `S`, and `j` is `M + 1` for the loop to execute again `M` must be greater than `M`**
