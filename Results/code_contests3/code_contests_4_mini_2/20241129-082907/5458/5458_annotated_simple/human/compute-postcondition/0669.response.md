The code snippet modifies the value of the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: 

- `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2, and `i + 1 & 1` results in 0 (since 2 & 1 equals 0 in binary).
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
- `k` is 1.

Thus, the statement assigns the value from `dp[0][3][1]` to `dp[0][2][1]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the variables themselves do not change, as they are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][2][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][3][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][2][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][3][1]`**.
