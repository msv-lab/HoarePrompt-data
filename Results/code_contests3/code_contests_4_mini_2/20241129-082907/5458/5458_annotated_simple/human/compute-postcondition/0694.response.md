According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues until `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is one less than or equal to `m`, and since `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` can take on the values from 1 up to `m`. If `j` is currently `m`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to `m + 1`. 

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, if `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2. If the loop executes again, `j` will have the value `m + 1`, which exceeds the loop's upper limit.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and must be less than or equal to `m`.**
