The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3 and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
