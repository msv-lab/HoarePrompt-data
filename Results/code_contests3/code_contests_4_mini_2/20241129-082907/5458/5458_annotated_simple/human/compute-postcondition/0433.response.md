According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time as `k` will be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the start of the next iteration, the state should reflect the updated value of `k`, while other values remain unchanged. 

State: **`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `m` at least 2, `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `s` at least 2, and `k` equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
