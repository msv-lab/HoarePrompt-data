According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either less than `k` or greater than or equal to `k`. If `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, the loop will not execute again. 

However, if `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute one more time. Given that `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will increase to 2. 

Therefore, if `k` is currently less than `s`, then `k` will be `2` for the next iteration, and the loop can execute again.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and must be less than `s`.**
