Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
