According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`, which will iterate from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since `s` is at least 1. 

The states to consider are:
- `k` starts at 1 for the first iteration, which is already set to `k` being equal to `s`.
- `n` and `m` are not directly relevant for the execution of this specific loop, as they do not affect the loop's range or control flow.

Since `k` is already set to 1 and `s` is at least 1, all necessary conditions for the loop to start executing are satisfied.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`**
