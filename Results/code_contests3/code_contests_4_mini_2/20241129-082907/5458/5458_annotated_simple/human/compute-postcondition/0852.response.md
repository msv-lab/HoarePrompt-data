Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, where `k - j` is either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `j`.***
