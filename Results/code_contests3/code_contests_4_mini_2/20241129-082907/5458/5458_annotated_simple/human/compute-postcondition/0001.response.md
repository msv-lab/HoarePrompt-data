According to the code, the `while 1:` loop is designed to run indefinitely since the condition is always true. Therefore, there are no specific states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The loop will proceed without any changes needed to the program state.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000**.
