Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The logic used in the nested loops for filling the `dp` array seems flawed. The indexing and updates to the `dp` array do not correctly reflect the constraints specified in the problem description, particularly the ascending order requirements for both the rows and columns of the bingo card. 

2. **Column Constraints**: The problem states that the integers in any column must be arranged in ascending order from top to bottom. The current implementation does not enforce this requirement properly, as it lacks checks to ensure that the integers chosen for each position in the column follow this ascending order.

3. **Distinct Integers Requirement**: The problem requires that all integers on the bingo card must be different. The current implementation does not ensure that the integers are distinct; it only checks whether the integers can sum to `S` under certain conditions without enforcing uniqueness.

4. **Output Calculation**: The program attempts to output the count of possible bingo cards mod `100000`, but the way it calculates this count is not aligned with the combinatorial logic needed to count the valid bingo cards that meet all the conditions. The use of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is not valid and does not seem to contribute towards correctly counting valid configurations.

5. **Looping Mechanism**: The outer loop runs `n ** 2` times, which does not appropriately reflect how to construct the bingo card as specified. The problem description does not specify that the number of iterations should be based on `n ** 2`, but rather on the constraints of rows and columns.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the specifications given in the problem description, making it incorrect.
