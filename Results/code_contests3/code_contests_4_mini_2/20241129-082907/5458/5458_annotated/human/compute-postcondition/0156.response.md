According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1, which means the loop has executed for the first time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `k` will be 2. For the loop to continue executing, `s` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`**
