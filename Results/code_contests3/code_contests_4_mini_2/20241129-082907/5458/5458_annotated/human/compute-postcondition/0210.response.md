According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. The loop variable `j` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `m + 1`. 

The current states indicate that `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1, which do not directly affect the loop execution. The variable `j` needs to start at 1 for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` is updated based on all iterations of the loops, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
