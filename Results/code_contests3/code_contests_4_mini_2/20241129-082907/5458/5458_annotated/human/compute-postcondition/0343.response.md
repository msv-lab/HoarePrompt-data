Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`.***
