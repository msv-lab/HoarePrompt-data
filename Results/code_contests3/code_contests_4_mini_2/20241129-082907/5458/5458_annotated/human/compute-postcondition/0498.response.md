Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the operation cannot be performed due to an invalid index access.***
