The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
