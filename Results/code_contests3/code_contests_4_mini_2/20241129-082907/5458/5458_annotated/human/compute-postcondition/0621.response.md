Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list reflecting the results of all iterations across the nested loops for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` from 1 to `m`, and `k` from 1 to `s`; the result of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed.**
