The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully updated, and `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
