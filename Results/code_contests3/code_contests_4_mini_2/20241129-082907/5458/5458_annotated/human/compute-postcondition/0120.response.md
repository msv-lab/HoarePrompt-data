Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to its next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the state. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
