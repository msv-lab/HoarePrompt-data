According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is designed to run from `0` to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n ** 2`, which means the loop can execute again as long as `i` is still less than `n ** 2`.

If `n` is an integer greater than 0, then `n ** 2` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times in total. Since `i` is currently less than `n ** 2`, we can determine that for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, if the loop executes one more time, `i` will be updated to `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n ** 2`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][j][k]` has been updated, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
