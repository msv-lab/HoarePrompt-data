The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value 1 to a specific position in the 2D list `dp`. The indices are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `(0 + 1) & 1`, which is `1 & 1` resulting in `1`. This means we are accessing the second dimension of `dp`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`. This means we are accessing the third dimension of `dp`.
- `k` is `1`, so we are accessing the `1` index of the last dimension.

Given the initial state where `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros, the value at `dp[1][2][1]` is set to `1`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the `dp` array, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
