Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to 1, while `i` remains 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.***
