According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. Since the loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `k` will be 4.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 4. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4**
