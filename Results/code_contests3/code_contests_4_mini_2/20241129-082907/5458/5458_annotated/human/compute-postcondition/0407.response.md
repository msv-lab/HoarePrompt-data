According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least `s`, meaning `s` is at least 2. This indicates that the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. 

After the current iteration, the next value of `k` will be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least 2, `s + 1` is at least 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2. For the loop to execute a next time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`, which is at least 4.**
