The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified but are within their defined ranges based on the initial state. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` will be 2, and since `k` is at least 1 (as `s` is at least 1 for the loop), `k - j` will be at least 0.

The impact of the code is that `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` will be updated based on the previous state of `dp` array values. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][1][k - 1] % mod.**
