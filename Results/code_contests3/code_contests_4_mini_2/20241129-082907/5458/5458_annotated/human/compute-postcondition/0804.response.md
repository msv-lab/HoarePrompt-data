The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `dp[1][4][1]` is updated to `dp[1][3][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
