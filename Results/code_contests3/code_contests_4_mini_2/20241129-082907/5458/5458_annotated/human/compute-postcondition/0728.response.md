According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 at the end of the last iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is an integer greater than 0, `n ** 2` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it must hold that `i` (which is now 2) is still less than `n ** 2`. Consequently, we derive that `n` must be at least 2 for `n ** 2` to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`**.
