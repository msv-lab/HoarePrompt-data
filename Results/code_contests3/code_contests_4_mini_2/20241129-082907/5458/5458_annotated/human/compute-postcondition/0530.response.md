Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] = dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, and the iteration continues.***
