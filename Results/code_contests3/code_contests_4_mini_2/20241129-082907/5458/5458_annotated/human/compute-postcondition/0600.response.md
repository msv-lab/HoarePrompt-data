According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `k = 1` and `k = 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be set to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to allow `k` to be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully updated, `k` is 3**
