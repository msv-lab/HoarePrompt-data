The values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` has been updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][2][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][1][k], `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` has been updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][2][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][1][k], `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
