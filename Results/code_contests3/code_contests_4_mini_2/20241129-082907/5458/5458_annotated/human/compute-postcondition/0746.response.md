The code snippet modifies a multi-dimensional array `dp` based on its previous values. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` effectively toggles between 0 and 1 based on the parity of `i`. However, since the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine specific values for `dp`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `s`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged nature of `n`, `m`, and `s`, combined with the state of the `dp` array after the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
