The command `continue` does not change any variable values and simply moves the control to the next iteration of the nearest loop. The previous values of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
