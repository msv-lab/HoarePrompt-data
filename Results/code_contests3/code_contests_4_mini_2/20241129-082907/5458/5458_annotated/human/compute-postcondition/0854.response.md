The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices are calculated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. In this context, we know that `k` is `3`, but we do not have specific values for `i` and `j`, only that `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least certain thresholds. The operation does not provide enough information about `i` and `j`, but it indicates there might be two dimensions affected by `i` and `j`, while `k` is fixed at `3`.

Since we lack concrete values for `i` and `j`, we cannot specify the exact changes to `dp`. The output state will reflect that an assignment operation has occurred, but without detailed values for all indices.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1.**
