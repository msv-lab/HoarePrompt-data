Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] to 1. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged. In the else case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
