According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can indeed execute. The initial state of `k` is set to `s + 1`, which means that the first execution of the loop will not take place because `k` should start from 1. 

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `k` must be adjusted to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
