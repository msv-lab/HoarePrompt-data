The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The value of `j + 1` will be one greater than the current value of `j`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. The value of `k` remains `1`. Therefore, the assignment will update the specific position in the `dp` array. 

The affected variables are `dp` and the indices calculated will depend on the values of `i` (even or odd). The previous values of `dp` are not specified, so we can only indicate the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
