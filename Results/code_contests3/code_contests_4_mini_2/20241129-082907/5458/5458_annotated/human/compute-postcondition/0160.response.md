The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
