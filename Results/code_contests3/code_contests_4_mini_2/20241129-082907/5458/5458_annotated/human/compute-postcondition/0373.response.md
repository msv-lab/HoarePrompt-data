Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, with the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remaining unchanged.***
