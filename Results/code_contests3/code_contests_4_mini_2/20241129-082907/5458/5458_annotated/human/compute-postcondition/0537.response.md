The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from one element of the 2D list `dp` to another element of the same list. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` must be less than `s` for the loop to execute again, so it retains its current value. The state of other variables is unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, and the assignment takes place based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, and the assignment takes place based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
