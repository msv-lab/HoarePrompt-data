The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
