According to the code, the loop iterates `k` from `1` to `s`, inclusive. The initial state provides that `s` is at least `1`, which ensures that the loop can execute at least once. The value of `k` is initialized to `s + 1`, which means it is outside the range of the loop before it begins. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute correctly:
1. `k` should be set to `1`, the starting value of the loop.
2. The conditions for `n`, `m`, and `s` do not need to be changed for the loop to execute, as they are already satisfied.
3. The condition for `j` is irrelevant to the execution of this loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
