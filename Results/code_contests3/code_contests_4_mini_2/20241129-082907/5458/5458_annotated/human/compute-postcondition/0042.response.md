According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which is already satisfied since `s` is at least 1. The loop variable `k` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `s + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, the value of `k` is already set to `s`, which means it will not execute the first time if `k` starts at `s`. For the loop to execute, `k` needs to be adjusted to 1 before the first execution of the loop, since the loop is designed to start at 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` starts at 1**
