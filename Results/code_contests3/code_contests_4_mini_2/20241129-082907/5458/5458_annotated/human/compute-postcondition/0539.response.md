Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `s` is an integer at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes to `m`, `n`, or `s`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no action is taken in this block.***
