The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` sets a specific value in a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into this array. 

However, the initial state mentions that `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` have specific values or constraints, but it does not specify the actual values of `i` or any other values that are necessary to execute that line of code. 

Since the only variable directly affected by the code is `dp`, and it does not specify how `i` is initialized or its current value, we cannot determine the exact output state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Therefore, the output state must reflect that the value at a specific index of `dp` is set to 1, but without knowing the specific indices, we cannot provide a more precise output.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, where `k` is 2 and `j` is 4.**
