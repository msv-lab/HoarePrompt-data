The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the 2D list `dp`. 

First, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1`. Given that `i` is equal to 0, this evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1` and results in `1`. 

Next, we evaluate `j + 1`. Since `j` is 3, this evaluates to `3 + 1`, resulting in `4`. 

Now we have determined the indices for the 2D list `dp` as follows:
- The first index is `1`
- The second index is `4`
- The third index is `k`, which is `1`

Therefore, the code updates `dp[1][4][1]` to `1`. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0; `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
