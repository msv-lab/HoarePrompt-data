According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` is at least 3 now, the next value of `j` will be at least 4.

Since `m` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `m` must be at least 4 (to accommodate the next value of `j`).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute a fourth time, `s` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is `s`, `j` is 4.**
