Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list reflecting the results of all iterations across the nested loops for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `j` from 1 to `m`, and `k` from 1 to `s`. The values in `dp` are determined by the conditions in the loop, specifically with values set to 1 when `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and updates based on previous states and the modulo operation for the remaining iterations.**
