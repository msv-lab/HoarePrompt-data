The code assigns a value of `1` to the `dp` array at the indices determined by the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `3`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1 = 1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
- `k` remains `3`.

The output state indicates that the value `1` is assigned to `dp[1][3][3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value 1.**
