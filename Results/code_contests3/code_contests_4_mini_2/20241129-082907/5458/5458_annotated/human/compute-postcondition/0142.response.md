According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, and since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. Therefore, `j` will be `m + 1` for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to `m + 1`, which is not possible.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be equal to `m + 1`**
