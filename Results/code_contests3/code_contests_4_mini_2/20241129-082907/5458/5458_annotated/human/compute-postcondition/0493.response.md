The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is even or odd. 
- The value of `j + 1` will be `4`, since `j` is `3`.
- The variable `k` remains `1`.

The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is unchanged, but its value is copied into the new position. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
