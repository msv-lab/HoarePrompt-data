The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The current values of the variables remain unchanged: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[0][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][1][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
