The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state since no variables have been altered.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]**.
