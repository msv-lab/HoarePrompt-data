Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is `s + 1`. The `dp` table is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, reflecting the computed values based on the previous states.**
