The code attempts to assign the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. However, since `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated to 4 and `k` is set to 2. Given that there is no valid update due to invalid index access, the values in `dp` are not modified. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 2, and no valid update occurs to `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 2, and no valid update occurs to `dp`.**
