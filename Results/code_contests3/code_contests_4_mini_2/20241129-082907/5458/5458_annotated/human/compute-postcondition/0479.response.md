The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, `k` is 3; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
