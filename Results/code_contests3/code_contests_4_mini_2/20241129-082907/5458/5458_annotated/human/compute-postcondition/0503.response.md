The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop (if present) to skip the remaining statements and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
