Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with 0s, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped.***
