The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` 2D list based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, so `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 based on the least significant bit of `i + 1`.
2. The value of `j` is 1 and is greater than `k` (which is also 1), so `j + 1` will be 2.
3. The assignment copies the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

The values of `dp` are updated as described, but without knowing the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we cannot determine exact values in `dp`. However, we can state that the elements of `dp` are modified based on the indices calculated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` has been updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][2][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][1][k], `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
