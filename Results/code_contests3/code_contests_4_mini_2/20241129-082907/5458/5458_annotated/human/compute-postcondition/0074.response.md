According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `m` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions.**
