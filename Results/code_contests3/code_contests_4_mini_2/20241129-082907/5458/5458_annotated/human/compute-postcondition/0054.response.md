Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, the operation cannot be completed due to an invalid index `k - j`.***
