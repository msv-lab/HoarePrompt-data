Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][j][k]` has been updated based on the values of `dp` according to the conditions in the loop for all `j` from 1 to `m` and for all `k` from 1 to `s`. The entries depend on the relationship between `j` and `k` across iterations, with specific updates when `i` is 0 or not.**
