The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside, the output state remains the same for all other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully updated, `k` is 3 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully updated, `k` is 3 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
