According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at a value less than or equal to `m` since the loop has not yet finished iterating through all values. Given that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which must be less than or equal to `m`. In order to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, and since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
