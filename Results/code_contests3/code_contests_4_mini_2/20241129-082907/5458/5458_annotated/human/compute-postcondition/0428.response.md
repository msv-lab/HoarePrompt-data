The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop. Since `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`, and the other variable states remain unchanged, the output state will reflect that we are continuing the loop and not altering any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][j][k]` has been updated, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
