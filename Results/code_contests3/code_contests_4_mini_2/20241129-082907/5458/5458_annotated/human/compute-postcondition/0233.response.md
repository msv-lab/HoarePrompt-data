According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the condition for the loop. The loop is set to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 1, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3.**
