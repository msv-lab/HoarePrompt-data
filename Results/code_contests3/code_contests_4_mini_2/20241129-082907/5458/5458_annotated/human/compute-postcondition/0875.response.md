The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `j` and `k` hold the values 3 and 2, respectively. Therefore, the expression `k - j` evaluates to `2 - 3`, which is -1. However, since array indices cannot be negative, this operation would typically not be valid in a standard programming context, but we can note that it is attempting to access an invalid index.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unaffected by this operation, and we will not specify values for them as they do not directly impact this line of code. 

Thus, the output state indicates that an attempt to access an invalid index has occurred, and we note the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is as provided, `k` is 2, `j` is 3; an attempt was made to access dp[i & 1][j][k - j] where k - j is -1.**
