According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. 

Since `s` is at least 1, the next value of `k` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
