The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since no specific loop context is provided, we can state that we are simply continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
