According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop executes as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3.

Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3**
