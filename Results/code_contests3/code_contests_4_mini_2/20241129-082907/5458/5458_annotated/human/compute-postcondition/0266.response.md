According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 4, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time.**
