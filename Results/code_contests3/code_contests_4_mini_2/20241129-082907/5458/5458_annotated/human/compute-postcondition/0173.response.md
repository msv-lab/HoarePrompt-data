Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
