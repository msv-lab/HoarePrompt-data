The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration, if applicable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
