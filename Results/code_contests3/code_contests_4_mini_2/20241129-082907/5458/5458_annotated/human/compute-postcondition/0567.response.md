According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the variable `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2 (since it's the second loop execution), and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3.

At this point, the requirements for the loop to execute a third time are that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, for the loop to execute a third time `k` is 3.**
