The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement suggests that we skip the current iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.
