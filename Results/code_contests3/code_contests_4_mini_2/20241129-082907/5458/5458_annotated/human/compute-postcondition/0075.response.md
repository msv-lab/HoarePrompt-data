According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Given that `s` is already stated to be at least 1, we can confirm that the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, `k` will take its first value from the range defined in the loop, which starts at `1`. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to `1` for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute the first time**
