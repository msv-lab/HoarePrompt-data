Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list. `dp` has been modified based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` throughout all iterations of the loop. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on previous values of `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have accumulated values based on previous updates.**
