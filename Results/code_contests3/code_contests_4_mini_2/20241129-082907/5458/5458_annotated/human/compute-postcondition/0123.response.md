According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is within the specified range of `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at `1` (since the loop starts at `1`), and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Given that `s` is at least `1`, the current iteration of the loop for `k` would have been `1`, and it will increment `k` by `1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the next state for the loop to execute once more requires `k` to be `2`. Since `s` is at least `1`, it can support this increment.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 (and must be less than or equal to `s + 1`)**.
