The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The previous variables `j` and `k` are in a condition where `j` is greater than `k`, so the operation can proceed. The precise values of the `dp` array are not provided, but we know that after this operation, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will change based on the addition.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**.
