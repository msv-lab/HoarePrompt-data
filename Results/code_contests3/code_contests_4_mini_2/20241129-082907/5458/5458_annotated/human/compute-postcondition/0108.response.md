According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0, which implies that `n ** 2` is greater than 0 as well. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 0, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, so we need to ensure that `n ** 2` is still greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on all iterations of the loops, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 1**.
