The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
