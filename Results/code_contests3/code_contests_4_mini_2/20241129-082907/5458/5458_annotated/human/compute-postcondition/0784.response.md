Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][3][2]` remains unchanged, and `dp[0][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod`.***
