Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` has been modified. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` remains 1. Otherwise, the value at `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` remains 2.***
