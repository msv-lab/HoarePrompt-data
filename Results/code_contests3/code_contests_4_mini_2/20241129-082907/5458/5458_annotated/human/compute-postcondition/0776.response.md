According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `s`, which determines the range of `k`. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and can go up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to run again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
