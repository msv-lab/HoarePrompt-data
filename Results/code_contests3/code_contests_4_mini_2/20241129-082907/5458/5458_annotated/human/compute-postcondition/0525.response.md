Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list with `dp[1][3][1]` set to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, and `i` is equal to 0; since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds true.***
