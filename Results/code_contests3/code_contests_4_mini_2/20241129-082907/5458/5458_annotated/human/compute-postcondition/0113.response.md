The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a multidimensional array or list named `dp`. The indices being accessed are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` results in `2`.
3. The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, the code is effectively assigning `1` to `dp[1][2][1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation, so their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
