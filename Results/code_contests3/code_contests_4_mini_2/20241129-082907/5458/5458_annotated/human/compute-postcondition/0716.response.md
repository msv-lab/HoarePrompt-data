Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is an integer at least 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop continues executing without skipping, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
