`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input provided to `raw_input()`, which takes a string of space-separated values and splits them into individual components. These components are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `N`, `M`, and `S` do not affect the assignment of `n`, `m`, and `s` directly, as they are initialized anew based on user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now based on the input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned input values from raw_input()**
