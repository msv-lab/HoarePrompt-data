The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates a specific entry in a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices for `dp` are calculated using the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1` because `i` is `0`. Hence, `i + 1` is `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` becomes `3`.
3. The value of `k` is `2`, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the specific location being updated is `dp[1][3][2]`, and it is being set to the value of `dp[1][2][2]`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`, along with the fact that the element at `dp[1][3][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][2][2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][3][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][2][2]**.
