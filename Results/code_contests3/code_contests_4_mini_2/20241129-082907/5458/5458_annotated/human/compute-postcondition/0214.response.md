The code assigns the value `1` to the multidimensional list `dp` at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The variable `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`. The variable `k` is at least `1`. Therefore, the assignment affects the `dp` list at position `[1][2][k]`, where `k` is at least `1`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
