Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, or `dp`.***
