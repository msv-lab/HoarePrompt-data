Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `k` is 3, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with the loop continuing to the next iteration.***
