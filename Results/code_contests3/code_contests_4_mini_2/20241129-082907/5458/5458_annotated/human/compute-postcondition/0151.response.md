The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but rather causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values, but we acknowledge that we are continuing to the next iteration of a loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
