The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] while we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
