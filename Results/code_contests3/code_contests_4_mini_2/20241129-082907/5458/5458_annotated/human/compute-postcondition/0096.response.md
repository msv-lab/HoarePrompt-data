Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1 and no valid update occurs to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` due to invalid index access. If `j` is less than `k`, the state remains unchanged with regards to the variables and the condition of `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is updated to 4, `k` is 2, and no valid update occurs to `dp`.***
