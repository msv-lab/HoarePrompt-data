According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The current state indicates that `k` is `s + 1`, which means the loop will not execute again unless `k` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to `s`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be set to 1, as that is the starting point of the range. After the first execution, `k` will increment with each iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Set `k` to 1 for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1.**
