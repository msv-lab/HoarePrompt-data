According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at 1 (the starting point of the loop) and needs to be incremented for the next iteration. Given that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute again for `j` equal to 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
