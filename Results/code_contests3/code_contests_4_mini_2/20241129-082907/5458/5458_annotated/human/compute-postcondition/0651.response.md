According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The current value of `k` is 2 at the end of the last iteration, which means the loop has executed for `k` values 1 and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `s` is at least 2, `s + 1` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be 3. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which is at least 2.**
