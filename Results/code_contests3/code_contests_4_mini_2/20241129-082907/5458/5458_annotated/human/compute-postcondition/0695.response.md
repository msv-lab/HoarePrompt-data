According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is stated to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `k` should be set to the first value in the range, which is 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, and `j`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
