The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The exact values of `dp` are not provided, but the assignment indicates that the variable `dp` at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now hold the value that was previously at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
