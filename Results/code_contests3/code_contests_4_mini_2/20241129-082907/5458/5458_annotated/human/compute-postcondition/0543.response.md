According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value of 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can run a second time.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
