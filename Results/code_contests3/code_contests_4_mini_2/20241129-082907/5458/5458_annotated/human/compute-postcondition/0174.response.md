Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is set to 1 for all valid `j`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values computed during the loop iterations.**
