According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute while `k` iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is provided but unspecified, we know that `k` can increment to 3 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 3, and `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`, which means `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
