Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then no valid update occurs to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` due to invalid index access. If `j` is less than `k`, the state remains unchanged with regards to the variables and the condition of `dp`.***
