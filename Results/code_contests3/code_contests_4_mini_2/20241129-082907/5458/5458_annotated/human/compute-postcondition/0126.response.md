The statement updates a specific location in a 3D array `dp` based on the values from another location in the same array. The indices involved are derived from the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The variable `k` must be 2 or less than or equal to `s + 1`, which ensures that the assignment is valid.

Since no specific values for `i`, `j`, and `k` are provided, we can only state the relation. The output state remains focused on the existing variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`, and we note that we are performing an assignment operation in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 and must be less than or equal to `s + 1`, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
