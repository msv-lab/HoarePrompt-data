According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. Since `s` is specified to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The loop will start with `k` initialized to 1, and it will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` will be equal to `s + 1`, which indicates that the loop has completed its execution. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` needs to start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
