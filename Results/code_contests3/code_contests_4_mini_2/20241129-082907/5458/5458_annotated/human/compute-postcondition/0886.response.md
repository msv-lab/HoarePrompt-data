According to the code, the for loop's execution depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 4. However, since `s` is at least 3, the loop can only execute again if `s` is greater than or equal to 4.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 4, and `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and `j` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
