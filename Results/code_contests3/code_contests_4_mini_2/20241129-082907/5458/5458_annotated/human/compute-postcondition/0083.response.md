The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is now 4, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions, and we skip this iteration of the loop.
