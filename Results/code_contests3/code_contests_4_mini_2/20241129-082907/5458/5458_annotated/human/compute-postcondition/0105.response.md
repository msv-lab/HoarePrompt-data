Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 but `j` is less than `k`, no assignment occurs. If `i` is not 0, then `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. The loop executes a second time only if `k` is 3.***
