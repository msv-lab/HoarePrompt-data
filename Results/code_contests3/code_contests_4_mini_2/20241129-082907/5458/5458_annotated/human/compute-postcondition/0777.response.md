The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves calculating indices based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. 
- The operation `3 & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation, which results in 1 (since 3 in binary is `11` and 1 in binary is `01`, the AND operation results in `01`).
- The value of `j` is also 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
- The value of `k` is 2.

Therefore, the code assigns the value `1` to the array element `dp[1][3][2]`.

Other variables `n`, `m`, `s` are not affected by this operation, so we only need to represent the changed state of `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][3][2]` is 1**.
