Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and if `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to `1`; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
