Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][1]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
