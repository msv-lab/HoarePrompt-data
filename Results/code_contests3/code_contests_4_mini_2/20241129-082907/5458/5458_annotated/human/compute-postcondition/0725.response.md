Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to 2 for the next iteration and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `k` or `dp`. In the else case, `k` is set to 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
