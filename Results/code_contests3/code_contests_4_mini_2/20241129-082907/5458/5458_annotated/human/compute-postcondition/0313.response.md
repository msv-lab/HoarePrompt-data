The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by reading input and converting it to integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is at least 1. However, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `s` after the input operation are unknown since they depend on user input. The variable `dp` remains unchanged, and the output state reflects the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s` as integers after input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` contains computed results**.
