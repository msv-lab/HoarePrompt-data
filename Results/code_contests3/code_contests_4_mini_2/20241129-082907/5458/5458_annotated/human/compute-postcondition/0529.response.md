The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program should skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] = dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] = dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
