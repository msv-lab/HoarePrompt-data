The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
