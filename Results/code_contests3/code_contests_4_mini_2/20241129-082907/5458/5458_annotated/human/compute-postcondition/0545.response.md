Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
