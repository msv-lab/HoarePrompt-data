Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on an unknown value from `dp[0][3][-1] % mod.***
