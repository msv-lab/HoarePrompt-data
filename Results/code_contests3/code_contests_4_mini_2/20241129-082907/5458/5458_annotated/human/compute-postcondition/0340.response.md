Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s + 1] is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp` remains a 2D list with all zeros having dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1] after the operation.***
