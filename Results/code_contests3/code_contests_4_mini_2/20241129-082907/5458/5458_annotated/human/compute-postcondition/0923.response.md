The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, `j` is 4, and the `dp` array is updated based on its previous values while we continue in the loop.
