The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `k` must be equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute a second time. The previous values of `dp` are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `dp` is initialized with zeros. Therefore, the output state reflects that one of the dimensions of `dp` is being updated based on its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where all values in `dp` are initially zeros.**
