Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the remaining statements in the current loop iteration are skipped.***
