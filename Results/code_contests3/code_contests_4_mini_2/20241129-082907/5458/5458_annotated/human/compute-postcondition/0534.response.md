According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. To determine whether the loop can execute again, we need to consider the current state of `k` at the end of the previous iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, which must be less than `s` for the loop to execute again. Given that `s` is at least 2, `k` can take values from 1 up to `s`. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `s`, which implies that the new value of `k` should be `k + 1`. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect the increment of `k`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `s`, and the new value of `k` is `k + 1`**.
