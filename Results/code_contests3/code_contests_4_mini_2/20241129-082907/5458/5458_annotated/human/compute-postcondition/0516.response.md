Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the program updates `dp` based on the calculations involving `j`, `k`, and `mod`.***
