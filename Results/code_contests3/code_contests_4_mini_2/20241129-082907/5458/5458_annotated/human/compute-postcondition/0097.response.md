According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2, which indicates that the loop can execute for `k` values of 1 and 2.

At the end of the last iteration, since we are currently considering the next iteration, `k` will need to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes again, `k` will be 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3 (to allow `k` to reach 3), and `k` will be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 3.**
