According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, as `k` will start from 1. 

The current state indicates that `k` is already set to `s + 1`, which means that the loop will not execute because `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `s` needs to be adjusted such that `s` is at least 1, which would make `k` equal to 1 at the start of the loop. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `s` should be at least 1, which results in `k` being 1 for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time**.
