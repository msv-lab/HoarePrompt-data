Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.***
