The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no change in the variable states or values as a result of this command, the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
