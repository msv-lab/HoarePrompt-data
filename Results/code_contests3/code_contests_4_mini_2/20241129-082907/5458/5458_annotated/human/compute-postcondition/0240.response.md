The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous state indicates that `k` is 3, so `k - j` will depend on the value of `j`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k - j` can take values between 2 (if `j` is 1) and 0 (if `j` is 3). The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not specified, and we do not have the specific values for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Thus, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but we know it is being updated.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
