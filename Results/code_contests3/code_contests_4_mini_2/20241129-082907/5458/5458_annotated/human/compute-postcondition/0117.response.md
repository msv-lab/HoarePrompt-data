The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves accessing and assigning values in a multidimensional list or array `dp`, based on the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The term `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the expression `i + 1` first, which will be 2 (since `i` is 1), and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. This results in `0` because `2 & 1` equals `0`.
2. `j + 1` evaluates to `2` (since `j` is 1).
3. `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the left-hand side of the assignment accesses `dp[0][2][1]`.

The right-hand side accesses `dp[0][1][1]` since `i + 1 & 1` is `0` and `j` is `1`.

Therefore, the assignment is effectively:
```
dp[0][2][1] = dp[0][1][1]
```

This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, but updates the `dp` array based on the current values. 

The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment operation that took place. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[0][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][1][1]**.
