Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least the final value of `s`, `dp` has been fully updated based on all iterations for `k` from 1 to `s`, `k` is `s + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` will be set to 1 for the first iteration. For subsequent iterations, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the corresponding `dp` values will be updated based on previous states. The final state of `dp` will reflect the cumulative updates made during all iterations of the loop.**
