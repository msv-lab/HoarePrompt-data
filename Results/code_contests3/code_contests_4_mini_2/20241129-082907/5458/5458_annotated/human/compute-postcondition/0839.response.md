The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
