The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided, but it is clear that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now hold a new value based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
