According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which runs from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2 (as `k` was initialized to 2 before the loop), and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increase by 1. 

Since `s` is at least 4, the loop can execute for `k` values up to 4. After the current iteration where `k` is 2, the next value of `k` will be 3. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `j` is 4. For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3.**
