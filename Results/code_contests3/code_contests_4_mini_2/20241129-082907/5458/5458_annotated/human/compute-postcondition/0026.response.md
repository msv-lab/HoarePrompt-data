The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, since the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][2][k]` are still valid, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][k] = dp[1][1][k] with no changes made to these values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][k] = dp[1][1][k] with no changes made to these values.**
