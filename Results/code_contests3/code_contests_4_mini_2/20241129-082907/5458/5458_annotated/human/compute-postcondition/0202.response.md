The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
