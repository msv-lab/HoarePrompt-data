The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command. Thus, the program will continue executing the loop with the current values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 1, `j` is 4, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
