Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 3 and `j` is greater than 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
