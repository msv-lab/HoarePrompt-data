The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input provided by the user through `raw_input()`, which is then split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is an integer at least 1, the specific values of these variables will be replaced by the user's input. The 2D list `dp` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `s` as integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1**
