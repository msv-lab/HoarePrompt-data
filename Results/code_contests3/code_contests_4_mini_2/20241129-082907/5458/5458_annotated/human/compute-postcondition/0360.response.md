The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the structure we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as we continue to the next iteration.
