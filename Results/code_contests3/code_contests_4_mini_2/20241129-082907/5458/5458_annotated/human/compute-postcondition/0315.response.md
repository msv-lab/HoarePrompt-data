Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` contains computed results. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without any specific action defined in the else part.***
