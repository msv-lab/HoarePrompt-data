The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it takes input from multiple datasets consisting of the values N, M, and S. N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and S is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The input consists of several datasets, and it continues until a dataset of "0 0 0" is encountered, which signals the end of input. 

The function processes these datasets and provides output based on the values of N, M, and S, but the specifics of the output are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to read multiple datasets of integers N, M, and S, and it stops processing when it encounters the dataset "0 0 0".

Functionality: **The function reads multiple datasets of positive integers N, M, and S, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, and stops processing upon receiving the dataset "0 0 0".**
