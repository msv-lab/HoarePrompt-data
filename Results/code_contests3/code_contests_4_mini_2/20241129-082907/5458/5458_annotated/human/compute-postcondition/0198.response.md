According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since the loop ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
