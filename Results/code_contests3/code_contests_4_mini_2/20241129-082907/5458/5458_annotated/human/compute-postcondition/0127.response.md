The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 and must be less than or equal to `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
