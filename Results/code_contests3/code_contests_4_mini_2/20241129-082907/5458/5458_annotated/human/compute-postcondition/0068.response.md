The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
