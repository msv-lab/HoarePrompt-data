The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
