According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least `s`, meaning `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` becoming 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
