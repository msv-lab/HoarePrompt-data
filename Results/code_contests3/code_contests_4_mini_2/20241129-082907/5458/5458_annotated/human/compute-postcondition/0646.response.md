The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with 0s, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.
