The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is affected by this operation, but we don't have specific values for `dp` or `mod`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented based on the provided logic.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
