According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the limit defined by `s`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, after the last iteration, `k` will become 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
