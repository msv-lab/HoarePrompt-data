Postcondition: ***If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, with `n` greater than 0, `m` greater than or equal to 1, `s` at least 3, and `k` equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time.***
