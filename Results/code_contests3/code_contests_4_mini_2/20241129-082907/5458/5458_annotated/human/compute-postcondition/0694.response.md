According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m + 1`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `j` is at least `m + 1`, it means that the loop has finished executing for its maximum value of `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `j` should be set to a value that is still valid within the range of the loop. However, since `j` is already at least `m + 1`, the loop cannot execute again unless `m` changes to allow a new valid iteration, or `j` resets to 1.

Since `j` is currently at least `m + 1`, it needs to be incremented to start the next iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will need to be reset to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`**
