According to the code, the loop will iterate based on the variable `k`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1, which means `k` will become 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
