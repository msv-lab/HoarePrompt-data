The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
