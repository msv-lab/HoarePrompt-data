Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
