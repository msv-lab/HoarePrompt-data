Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
