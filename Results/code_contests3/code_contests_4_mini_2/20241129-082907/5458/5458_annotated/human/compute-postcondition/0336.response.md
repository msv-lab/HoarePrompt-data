The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
