Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list where if `i` is 0, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated to 1; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, `j` is set to 3, and `k` remains 2. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][3][2] by adding `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is now 3, and `k` is 2.***
