The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since it does not alter the values of any variables directly, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
