Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `i`, `j`, and `k` remain as 0, 1, and 1 respectively. Otherwise, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[0][j][k] % mod`, `i` is updated to 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is also updated but remains unchanged due to potential negative indexing.***
