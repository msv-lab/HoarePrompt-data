According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop is set to execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least `s`, the loop has executed once for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, if the loop executes again, `k` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is still valid since `s` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
