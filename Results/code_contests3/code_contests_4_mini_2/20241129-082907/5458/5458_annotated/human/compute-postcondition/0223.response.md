Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
