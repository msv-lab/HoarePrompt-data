Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with 0s. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to 1, with `i` remaining 0, `j` being 1, and `k` being 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
