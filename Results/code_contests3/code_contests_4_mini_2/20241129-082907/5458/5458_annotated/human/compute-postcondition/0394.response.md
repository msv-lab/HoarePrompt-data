Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` while continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
