According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which is being incremented by 1 with each iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, meaning `n ** 2` is at least 1. 

Since the loop has been iterating up to `n ** 2`, we can denote the last value of `i` as `i` (where `i` is the current index). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. 

Thus, if we assume `i` was at its last value before the current iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to reflect the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, indicating that `i + 1` must still be less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list based on the iterations from j = 1 to m and k = 1 to s, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, with `i` being incremented by 1.**
