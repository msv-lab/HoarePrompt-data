The `continue` statement instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state will reflect that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without altering the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, or `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been updated, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
