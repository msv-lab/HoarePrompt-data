Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 2 for the second loop execution), then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `k` is 3 (for the third loop execution), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
