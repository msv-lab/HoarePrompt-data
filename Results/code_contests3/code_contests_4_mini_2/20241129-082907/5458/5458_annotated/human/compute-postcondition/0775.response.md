Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1 since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][1]` is updated based on the value of `dp[0][2][-1] % mod.***
