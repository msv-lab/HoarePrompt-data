According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` contains updated values based on the loop conditions.**
