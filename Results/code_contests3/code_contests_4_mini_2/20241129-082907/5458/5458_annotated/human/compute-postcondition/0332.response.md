According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at the end of its range, which is `s`. This means that `k` needs to be incremented for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be equal to `s + 1`, and since the loop is designed to run from 1 to `s + 1`, the next valid value for `k` will be `s + 1`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros having dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1], for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be equal to `s + 1**.
