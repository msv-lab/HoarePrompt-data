The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates a specific element in the 2D list `dp`. The index used for the first dimension is determined by the expression `i + 1 & 1`, which evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. The second dimension is indexed by `j + 1`, and the third dimension is indexed by `k`, which is given as 3.

Since `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that `k` is 3, and the operation assigns the value 1 to a specific cell in the `dp` list based on the calculated indices.

Therefore, after executing this line of code, the state of the variables is not explicitly altered other than the update to the `dp` list. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] to 1**.
