Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.***
