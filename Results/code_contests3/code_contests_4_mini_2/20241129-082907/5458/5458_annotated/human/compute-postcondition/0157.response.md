The code snippet assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous state indicates that `i` is equal to `0`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to `1`, as the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` and `k` is `2`. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1**.
