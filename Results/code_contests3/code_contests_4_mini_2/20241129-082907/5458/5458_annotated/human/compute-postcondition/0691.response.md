The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` involves updating the `dp` array based on specific indices derived from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. **Calculate the indices:**
   - `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 1, `1 + 1 & 1` results in `2 & 1`, which is `0`.
   - `j + 1`: `j` is increased by 1, so we denote the new value of `j` as `j + 1`.
   - `k`: remains as `k`, which is `s + 1`.

2. **Current values:**
   - `i = 1`
   - `j` is increased by 1 (let's denote the new value as `j' = j + 1`).
   - `k = s + 1`.
   - `dp[1][j][k]` is assigned a value which is now used to update `dp[0][j'][k]`.

3. **Updating the `dp` array:**
   - We access `dp[0][j'][k - j]` and use its value to update `dp[0][j'][k]` with the modulus operation applied.

4. **Impact on the program:**
   - The value at `dp[0][j'][k]` is updated based on the previous value at `dp[0][j'][k - j]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updates made to the `dp` array and the new values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.**
