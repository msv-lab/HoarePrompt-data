According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, since the loop runs for `n ** 2` iterations. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `n ** 2` will also be 0. The values of `m` and `s` do not directly affect the execution of this loop. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input value, `s` is an input value, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
