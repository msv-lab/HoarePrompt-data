Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, retaining its previous value before this operation.***
