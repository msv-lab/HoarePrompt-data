The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]`, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
