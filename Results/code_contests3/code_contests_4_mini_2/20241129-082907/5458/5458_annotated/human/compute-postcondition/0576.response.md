According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `s` is at least 3, meaning `k` can take values from 1 up to at least 3. Since the loop is currently at `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, since `k` is currently the last value it took (which must be less than or equal to `s`), we can set `k` to be the next integer, which is `k + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and since `s` is at least 3, `k` will now be at least 4 for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, now `k` is incremented to `k + 1`.**
