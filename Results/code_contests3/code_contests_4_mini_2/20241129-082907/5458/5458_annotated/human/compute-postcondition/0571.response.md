The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
