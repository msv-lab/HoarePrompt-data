Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is `s`, `j` is at least 3. The `dp` array has been updated according to the loop conditions for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, with values depending on the logic and conditions evaluated during the iterations.**
