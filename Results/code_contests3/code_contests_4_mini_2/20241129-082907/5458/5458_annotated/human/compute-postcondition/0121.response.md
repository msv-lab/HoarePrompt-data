The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes to the values of `i`, `j`, or `k`. The values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are modified, but since the values of `dp` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact output. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged while the `dp` array is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
