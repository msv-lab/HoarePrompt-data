According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `s`. In the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` should be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**
