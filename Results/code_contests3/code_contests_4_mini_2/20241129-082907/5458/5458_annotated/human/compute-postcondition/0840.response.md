Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][1]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
