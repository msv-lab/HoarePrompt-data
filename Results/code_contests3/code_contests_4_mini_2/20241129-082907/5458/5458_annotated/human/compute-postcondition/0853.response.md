According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop is set to execute for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, leading to `k` being 3.

Since `s` is at least 2, `s + 1` is at least 3, allowing the loop to execute for `k` equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, k is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
