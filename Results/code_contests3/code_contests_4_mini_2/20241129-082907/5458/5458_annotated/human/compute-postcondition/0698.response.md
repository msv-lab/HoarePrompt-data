The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` evaluates to `2`. The value of `k` is 1, so `k` remains `1`. 

Thus, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` translates to `dp[1][2][1] = 1`. This updates the 2D list `dp` at the specified indices without affecting the other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is updated at indices [1][2][1] = 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is updated at indices [1][2][1] = 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
