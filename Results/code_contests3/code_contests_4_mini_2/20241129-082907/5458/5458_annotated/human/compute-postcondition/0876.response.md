Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is as provided, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` has been updated at `dp[1][j + 1][2] = 1`. Otherwise, an attempt was made to access `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` where `k - j` is -1.***
