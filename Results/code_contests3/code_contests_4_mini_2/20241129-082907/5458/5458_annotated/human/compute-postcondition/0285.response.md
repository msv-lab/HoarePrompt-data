The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
