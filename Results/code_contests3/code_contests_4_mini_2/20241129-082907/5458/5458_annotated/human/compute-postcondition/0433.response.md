According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, which must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be equal to 2 if `s` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
