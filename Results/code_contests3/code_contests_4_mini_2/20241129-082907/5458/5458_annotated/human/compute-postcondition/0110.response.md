According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, inclusive of the start value and exclusive of the end value. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `k` is already set to `s + 1`, which means that the loop will not execute a second time, as the range only goes up to `s`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range, which would be `k` set to 1 at the beginning of the next iteration.

Additionally, the state indicates that `j` must be set to 1 for the loop to execute a second time, which also needs to be included in the state.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
