The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the remaining statements in the current loop iteration.
