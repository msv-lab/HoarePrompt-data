Since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states because the loop is guaranteed to run again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` contains computed results, and the value printed is `dp[n`**
