Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `i` is equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value `1`.***
