The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous state of `dp` affected by this line will be based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the operation is valid, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its previous value while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly. The states of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
