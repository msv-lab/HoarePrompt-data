According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` to continue executing the loop. 

Given that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and the loop will execute for the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2 (the next value after the current value of `k`).

Additionally, since `s` is at least 1, and `k` must remain less than or equal to `s + 1` for the loop to continue executing, we should ensure that `s` remains greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time (`k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`).**
