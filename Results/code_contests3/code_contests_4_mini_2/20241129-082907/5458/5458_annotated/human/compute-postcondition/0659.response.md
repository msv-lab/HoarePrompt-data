Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` if applicable.***
