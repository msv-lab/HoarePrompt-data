The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in a 3D array `dp`. The indices for this assignment are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, this becomes `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j + 1` is evaluated. Given that `j` is `1`, this becomes `1 + 1`, which equals `2`.
- The value of `k` is directly used, and it is specified that `k` must be `2` for the loop to execute a second time.

Thus, the assignment is made to `dp[1][2][2]`, setting that specific entry of the `dp` array to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2; `dp[1][2][2] = 1**
