According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to and including `m`. Since `m` is given to be an integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop will indeed execute at least once.

Before the loop starts, the relevant states are already set as follows:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 (though this does not affect the loop execution).
- `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, which ensures that the loop has at least one iteration.
- `s` is an integer at least 1 (also not affecting loop execution).
- `dp` is initialized properly.
- `i` is 0, which is not directly relevant for the loop iterations since it is not used in this context.

Since `j` will start from 1 and iterate to at most `m`, and given that `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute without any modifications needed to the states. 

Therefore, the state can remain as is, but we must note that `j` will be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is initialized as a 2D list of dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1) filled with 0s, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
