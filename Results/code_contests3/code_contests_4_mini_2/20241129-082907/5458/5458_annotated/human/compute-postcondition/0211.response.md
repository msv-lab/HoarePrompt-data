According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is `s + 1`, which means it will be reassigned to `1` at the start of the loop. The variable `j` is already set to `1` for the loop to execute the first time. 

Since `n` and `m` do not affect the loop execution directly, the states related to `n` and `m` do not need to be adjusted. However, it is important to note that `dp` is updated based on the iterations of the loops, and while it does not affect the first execution of this specific loop, it is part of the overall context.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
