Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2 (and must be less than or equal to `s + 1`). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
