The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Here, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. The values of `j` and `k` allow us to access the indices of the `dp` list, and since `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, and `s` is at least 1, we can assume `mod` is a defined variable. 

The operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, or `i`, but it updates the `dp` list at the specified indices. The previous values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod` are necessary for calculating the new value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.**
