According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `k` will take on the values from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute the second time, the variable `k` needs to be updated to 2 after the first loop iteration. 

Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. Hence, before the loop starts, `k` is initialized to 1 (the first value in the range). 

To summarize:
- The loop will execute a second time if `k` is updated to the next value in the range, which is 2 after the first iteration.
- Since `s` is at least 1, the second iteration will also execute.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 (after the first iteration), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m` and `j` is updated to `j + 1`**
