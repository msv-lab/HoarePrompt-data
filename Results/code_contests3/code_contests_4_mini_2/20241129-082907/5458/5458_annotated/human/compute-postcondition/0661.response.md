According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1. Since `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Assuming `j` is currently at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented to at least 2, and the condition for the loop would require that `j` be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
