According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at the maximum value of `s`, which is greater than or equal to 1. 

If `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to set `k` to `s + 1`, and since `s` is at least 1, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` has been modified, `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` must be greater than `s` (that is, `k` is `s + 1`)**
