Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `s` (the original value), `k` is `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions checked in the loop, specifically if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s` or based on previous values of `dp`.**
