Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to `1`; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated with the value from `dp[1][j][1] % mod`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is further updated with `dp[0][j][1 - j] % mod`. The state of the variables remains consistent with these conditions.***
