According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 in the next iteration. Additionally, since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 1**
