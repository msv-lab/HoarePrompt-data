The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of the `dp` array. The indices used in this assignment depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The variable `k` will be incremented to `2` for the next iteration, but this does not affect the current assignment. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the result of the assignment don't change; however, the value at the specified index in the `dp` array is updated to `1`. 

Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact index modified in the `dp` array. However, we can note that `k` is set to `2` for the next iteration, while the current state reflects the assignment made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `k` is updated to 2 for the next iteration, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
