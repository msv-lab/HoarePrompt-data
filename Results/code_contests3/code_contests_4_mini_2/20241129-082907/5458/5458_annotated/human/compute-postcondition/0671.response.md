Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, maintaining the conditions that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1.***
