The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement following the current point of execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
