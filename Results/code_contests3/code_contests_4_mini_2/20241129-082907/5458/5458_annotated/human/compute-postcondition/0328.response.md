Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` has been updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][2][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][1][k], `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration.***
