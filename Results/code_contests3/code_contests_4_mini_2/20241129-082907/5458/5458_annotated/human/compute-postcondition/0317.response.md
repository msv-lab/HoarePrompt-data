According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, which it is, given that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. The loop variable `i` is initialized before the loop starts, and it will take on values starting from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be 0 when the loop begins its first execution.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros having dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1], `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
