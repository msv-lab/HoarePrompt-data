Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1), `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and the program progresses to the next iteration or statement. Otherwise, there is no action taken since there is no else part.***
