According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which is iterated from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `s` is at least 1, therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since the loop starts at `k = 1`, for it to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 2. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted accordingly. The loop will execute a second time if `k` is 2 and `s` must be at least 2 for this condition to be satisfied.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
