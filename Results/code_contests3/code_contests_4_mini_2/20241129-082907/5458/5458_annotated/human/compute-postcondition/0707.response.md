Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) x (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is updated to 1, while `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, when `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] using the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, with `i` not equal to 0, `j` equal to 1, and `k` equal to 1.***
