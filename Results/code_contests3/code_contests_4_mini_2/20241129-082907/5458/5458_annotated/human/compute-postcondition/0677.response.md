Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` has been modified at position [1][j + 1][2] to be 1, `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.***
