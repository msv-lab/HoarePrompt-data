The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 2, and no valid update occurs to `dp`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
