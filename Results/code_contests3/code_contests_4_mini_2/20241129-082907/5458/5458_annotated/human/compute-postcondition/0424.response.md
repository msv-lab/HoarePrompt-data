Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[1][3][2]` has been updated to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and `j` is set to 3 while `k` remains 2.***
