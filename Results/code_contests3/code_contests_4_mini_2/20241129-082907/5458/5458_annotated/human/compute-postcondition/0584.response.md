Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is incremented to `k + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array is updated based on the computation while maintaining the conditions of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the incremented `k`.***
