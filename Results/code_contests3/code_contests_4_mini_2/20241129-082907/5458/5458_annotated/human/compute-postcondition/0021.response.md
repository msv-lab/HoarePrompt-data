Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][1][k - 1] % mod.***
