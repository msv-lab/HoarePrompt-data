The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in the 2D list `dp`. The indices are calculated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` results in the value of either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is even or odd. Thus, the first index of `dp` will toggle between `0` and `1`. The second index `j + 1` will depend on the value of `j`, and `k` is already defined as being equal to `2` for the loop to execute a second time.

Since `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than their defined limits, they do not affect the assignment. The final output state will reflect the assignment made to `dp` at the computed indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, `dp` has an updated value at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` equal to 1.**
