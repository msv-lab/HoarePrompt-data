The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value assigned is the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since the initial state specifies conditions about `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j`, but does not provide specific values or the value of `mod`, we cannot determine the exact values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` or the resulting `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

However, the assignment indicates that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will hold the result of this modulo operation, which implies that it has now been updated. Other variables are not affected directly by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
