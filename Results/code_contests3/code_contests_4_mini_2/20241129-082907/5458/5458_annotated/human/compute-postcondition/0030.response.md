Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][1][2] % mod`, and `dp[1][2][2]` is further updated with `dp[0][1][0] % mod`.***
