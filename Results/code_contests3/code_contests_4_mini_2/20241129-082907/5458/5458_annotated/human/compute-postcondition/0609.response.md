According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which is iterated from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Given that `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully updated, and `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time.**
