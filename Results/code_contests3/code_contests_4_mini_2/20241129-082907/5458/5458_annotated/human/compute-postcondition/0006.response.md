Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are input values. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we create a 2D list `dp`, which is a list of lists, where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second dimension has `m + 2` lists, each containing `s + 1` zeros.**
