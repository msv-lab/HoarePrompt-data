The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the `dp` array at the indices determined by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- Given `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is odd or even.
- The value of `j + 1` will be incremented by 1, making it at least 2 since `j` starts at 1.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.
- The operation accesses `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which is based on the current `i`, `j`, and `k` values. The expression `k - j` adjusts `k` by subtracting `j`, maintaining that this index is valid based on the constraints given.

Thus, the output state should reflect the updated value in the `dp` array without altering the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] using value from dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
