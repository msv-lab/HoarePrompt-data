Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list. The values in `dp` reflect the accumulated results based on all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Specifically, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for the first iteration. For subsequent iterations, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the corresponding `dp` values will be updated based on previous states and the modulo operation. Overall, the final state of `dp` will summarize the results of all iterations across the nested loops.**
