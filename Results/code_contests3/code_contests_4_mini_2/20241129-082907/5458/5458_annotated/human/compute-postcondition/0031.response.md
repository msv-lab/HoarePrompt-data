According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1, meaning `s` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. 

After the current iteration, the value of `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` will be 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3**
