According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s`, which means `s` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute. Since it is stated that `s` is at least `1`, the loop can execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `k` will take on the value of `1` during the first iteration. The variable `k` is set to `s` before entering the loop, but will be overwritten by the loop variable.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` will be `1` when the loop starts executing.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
