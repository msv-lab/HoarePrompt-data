Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` has been modified, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` remains `s + 1`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
