Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any operation related to the assignment.***
