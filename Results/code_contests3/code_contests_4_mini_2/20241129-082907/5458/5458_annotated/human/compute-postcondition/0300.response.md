The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific position in a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices used for this assignment are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is `0`, this evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1` equals `1`.
- `j + 1`: Since `j` is `2`, this evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
- `k`: The value of `k` is `3`.

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][3][3] = 1` occurs.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.**
