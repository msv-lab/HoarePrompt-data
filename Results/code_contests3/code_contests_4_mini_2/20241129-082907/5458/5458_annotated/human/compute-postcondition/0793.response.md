Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
