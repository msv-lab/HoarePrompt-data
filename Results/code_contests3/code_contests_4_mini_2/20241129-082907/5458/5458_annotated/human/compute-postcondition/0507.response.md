Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the assignment operation is attempted with `dp`, but the indices may lead to an invalid state.***
