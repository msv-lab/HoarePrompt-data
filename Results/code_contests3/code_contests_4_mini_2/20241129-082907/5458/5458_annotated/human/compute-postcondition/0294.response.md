The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][3][2]` is equal to `dp[1][2][2]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
