According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be 2. 

Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 so that the range `(1, s + 1)` includes the value 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
