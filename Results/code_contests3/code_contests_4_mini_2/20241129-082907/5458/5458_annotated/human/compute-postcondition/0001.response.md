Since the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute one time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, `mod` is 100000**
