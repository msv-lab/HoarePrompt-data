According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` takes on values from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state of `i` and `j` does not affect the execution of this loop, as they are not used within the loop condition. 

Before the loop starts, `k` needs to be initialized to 1 for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros having dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1], `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
