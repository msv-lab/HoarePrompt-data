According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its range defined by `s`. The loop is set to run for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `s` is at least 4, the loop can execute again because `k` (which will be 2) is still within the range defined by `s`. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect these changes and ensure that for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 2, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
