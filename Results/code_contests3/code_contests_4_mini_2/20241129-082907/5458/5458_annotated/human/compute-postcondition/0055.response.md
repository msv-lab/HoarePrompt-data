According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2 (since `s` is at least 1, this condition is satisfied). After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will become 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2, and `k` will be 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
