According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Given that `s` is an integer at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be incremented to 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2 and it must be less than or equal to `s`. 

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
