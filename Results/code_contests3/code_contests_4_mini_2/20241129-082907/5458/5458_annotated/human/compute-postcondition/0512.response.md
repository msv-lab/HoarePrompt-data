The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration in the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer at least 3, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
