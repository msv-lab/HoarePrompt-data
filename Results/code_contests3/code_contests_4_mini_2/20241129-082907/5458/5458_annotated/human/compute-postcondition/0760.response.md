Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
