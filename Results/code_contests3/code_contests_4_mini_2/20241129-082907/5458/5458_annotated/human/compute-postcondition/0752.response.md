According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The `for` loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` has reached its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Given that `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If currently `k` is less than `s`, then `k` can be incremented to `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and the value of `k` will be incremented to `k + 1`.**
