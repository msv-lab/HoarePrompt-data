Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` has been updated at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s + 1] to 1.***
