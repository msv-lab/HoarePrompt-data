The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies a multi-dimensional array `dp`. Here, `i`, `j`, and `k` have specific values. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated first. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The operation `3 & 1` results in `1` because in binary, 3 is `11` and 1 is `01`, and their bitwise AND is `01`, which is `1` in decimal.
2. The value of `j + 1` is calculated next. The value of `j` is 3, so `j + 1` equals 4.
3. The value of `k` remains unchanged, which is 3.

The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][4][3]`, but since the output state does not provide the state of the entire `dp` array and focuses on the changed values, we acknowledge that `dp[1][4][3]` is now `1`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
