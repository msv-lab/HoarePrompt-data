The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` relies on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 4 for `k - j` to be non-negative. The previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not specified, but it is used to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the increment operation on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the earlier state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
