According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` which starts at 1 and goes up to `m` (inclusive). Currently, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, meaning that the loop has already executed at least once (for `j` = 1) and will execute again for `j` = 2. The `j` variable will increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to 2. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 2, it allows for another iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully updated based on the iterations with `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2.**
