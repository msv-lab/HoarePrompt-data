The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is retained in the initial state, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is accessed using the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Since the specifics of `dp` values are not provided, we canâ€™t calculate the exact numerical result but we can assert that the update occurs based on the current state of `dp`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and it retains its previous value before this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod,` retaining its previous value before this operation.**
