According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can run again. 

After the last iteration, `k` was 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` needs to be updated to 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
