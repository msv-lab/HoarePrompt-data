According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to and including `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, allowing for the possibility of another iteration.

Given that `j` is currently at a value less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` is currently `k`, it will become `k + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be `k + 1` and `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
