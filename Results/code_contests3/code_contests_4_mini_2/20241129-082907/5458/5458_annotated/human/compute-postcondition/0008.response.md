According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input value, `s` is an input value, and `i` is 0. 

However, to ensure that the loop will execute, we need to confirm that `m` is at least 1 before the loop starts, and the `j` variable will start at 1. Thus, the relevant states to ensure the loop executes are the value of `m` being greater than or equal to 1 and the initial value of `j` being 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input value, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
