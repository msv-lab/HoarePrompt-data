Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` must be 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
