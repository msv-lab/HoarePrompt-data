In the given code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves several operations based on the current values of the variables. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates `i + 1`, where `i` is 0. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 1. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in 1.
2. The variable `j` is currently 3, so `j + 1` equals 4.
3. The variable `k` is 1, which is used directly in the indexing of `dp`.

Thus, the operation affects the `dp` array at index `[1][4][1]`, setting that position to 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are not directly altered by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
