The code `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change but we skip the current loop iteration, the output state remains unchanged in terms of values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `k` is 3, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is a fully updated 2D list, `k` is 3, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
