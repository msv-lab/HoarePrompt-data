Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, and `k` will be incremented to `2` for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
