The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `i` remains 0, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
