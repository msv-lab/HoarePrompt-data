The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `m` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an input integer at least 1, `dp` contains computed results, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
