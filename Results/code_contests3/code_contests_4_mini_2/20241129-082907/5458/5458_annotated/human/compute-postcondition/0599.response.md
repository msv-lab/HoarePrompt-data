Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully updated, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the loop continues to the next iteration with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being updated.***
