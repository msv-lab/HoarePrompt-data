The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` do not change and the statement does not affect the values of variables directly, the output state remains the same but indicates that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
