According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will iterate while `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented.

Given that `k` starts at 1 and the loop continues until `k` is greater than `s`, and since `s` is at least 1, the next value for `k` would be 2 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `k` is now 2.
- `s` remains at least 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and `s` must be at least 2.**
