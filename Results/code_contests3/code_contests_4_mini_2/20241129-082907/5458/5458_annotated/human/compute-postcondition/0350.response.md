Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to all `k`, then the respective entries in `dp` are set to 1. For `i` not equal to 0, `dp` entries are updated based on the previous state, specifically influenced by the conditions regarding `j` and `k`.**
