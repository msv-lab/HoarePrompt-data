The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` must be 3 for the loop to execute a second time, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
