Functionality: ** The function reads multiple datasets of positive integers N, M, and S, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. For each dataset, it performs computations based on nested loops to fill a 2D list `dp` and prints the value of `dp[n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. The function continues processing until it encounters the dataset "0 0 0", which signals it to stop. The output is the computed result for each dataset based on the dynamic programming approach implemented in the nested loops. **
