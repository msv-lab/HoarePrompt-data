Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer at least 2, and `dp` is a fully updated 2D list. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop, where `k` is 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`.***
