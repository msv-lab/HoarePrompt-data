Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement the required logic to generate valid Bingo cards according to the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The nested loops and the `dp` array manipulation attempt to compute some values based on the input constraints, but they do not correctly enforce the conditions given in the problem. Specifically, the logic for filling the `dp` array does not ensure that the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom and that each integer is larger than any integer in the column to the left.

2. **Column Constraints**: The problem states that the integers in any column must be arranged in ascending order. However, the program does not have a mechanism to enforce this condition when filling the `dp` array.

3. **Unique Integers Requirement**: The program should ensure that all integers on the Bingo card are unique and fall within the specified range (1 to M). The current implementation does not explicitly check for uniqueness or manage the integer values to ensure they meet the requirements.

4. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation uses a modulo operation on the `dp` array value, which may not correctly reflect the number of distinct Bingo cards that can be formed under the given constraints.

Overall, the program's approach does not adequately follow the problem description, especially concerning the specific constraints related to the arrangement of numbers in the Bingo card. Thus, it fails to provide correct outputs for the given inputs.
