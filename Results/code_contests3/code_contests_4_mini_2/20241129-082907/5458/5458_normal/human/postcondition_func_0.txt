The function processes multiple datasets of three positive integers N, M, and S, where N ranges from 1 to 7, M ranges from 1 to 2000, and S ranges from 1 to 3000. It calculates and prints a value derived from a dynamic programming table based on these inputs. The processing terminates when all three inputs are 0. The function handles up to 5 datasets and outputs the computed result for each dataset.
