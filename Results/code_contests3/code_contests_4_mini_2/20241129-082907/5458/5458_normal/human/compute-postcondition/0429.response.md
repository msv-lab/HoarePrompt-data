Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][1]` if `j` is greater than `k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain as `current_value + 1`, `1`, and `1` respectively, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
