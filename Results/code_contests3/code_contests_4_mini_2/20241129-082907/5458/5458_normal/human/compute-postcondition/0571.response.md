The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that no variables were altered, and we continue processing within the loop.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `j` are integers greater than 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
