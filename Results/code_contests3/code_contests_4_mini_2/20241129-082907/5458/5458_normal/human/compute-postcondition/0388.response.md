The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `1`, so `j + 1` will be at least `2`. Therefore, the index used in the `dp` array is `[1][j + 1][1]`, and it is set to `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
