According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute for the next value of `k` as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and it is stated that `S` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined with `S` greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `S` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
