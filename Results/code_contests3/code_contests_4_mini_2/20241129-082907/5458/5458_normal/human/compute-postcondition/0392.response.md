The code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, `i`, and `j` do not directly change during this operation. The specific values involved in the array indexing will depend on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but without specific numerical values for those variables, we cannot determine exact values for `dp`. However, we can note that the operation does not change `S`, `k`, or the other variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M + 1`, `S`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1) with the assignment made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
