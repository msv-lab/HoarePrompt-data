Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers; `j` is greater than `k`, so the loop continues to the next iteration without changing any variable values. The statement dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod is executed, affecting the dp array without modifying `N`, `M`, or `S`.**
