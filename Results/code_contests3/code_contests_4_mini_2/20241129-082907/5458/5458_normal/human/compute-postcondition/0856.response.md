The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that a value from the `dp` array is being assigned to another index of the `dp` array. However, without knowing the specific values of `i`, `j`, and the structure of `dp`, we cannot determine the exact values being referenced or assigned. The output state therefore reflects that the operation modifies the `dp` array based on the current indices.

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unaffected by this operation since they are not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; the assignment modifies the `dp` array at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
