According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `i`, `j`, `N`, `M`, and `S` are all greater than 0, and `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is outside the loop's range. This means that the loop cannot execute again as the next value of `k` would exceed the upper limit.

Thus, if the loop were to execute again, `k` would have to be `s + 1`, which is not valid. Therefore, the loop cannot execute a second time under the given conditions.

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0, `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, but currently `k` is `s` and will be incremented to `s + 1` which is out of range.**
