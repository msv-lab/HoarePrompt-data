The code reads three integers from input, assigning them to `n`, `m`, and `s`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are now updated to these new input values. Since `N` is assigned to `n`, `M` to `m`, and `S` to `s`, we can state that `N`, `M`, and `S` will take whatever positive integers are provided as input within the specified ranges. The previously defined values of `dp` and `i` remain unchanged for this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `N`, `M`, and `S` after reading the input.

Output State: **`N` is the input value of `n`, `M` is the input value of `m`, `S` is the input value of `s`, `dp` contains values determined by the loop logic, `i` is equal to `N^2`**.
