According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. Since `j` is currently at 1 and the loop iterates while `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since both `m` and `j` are greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `m` are all greater than 0, `k` is `S + 1`, `dp` has been updated according to the loop's logic, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and it must be less than or equal to `m`**
