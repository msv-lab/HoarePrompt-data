The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
