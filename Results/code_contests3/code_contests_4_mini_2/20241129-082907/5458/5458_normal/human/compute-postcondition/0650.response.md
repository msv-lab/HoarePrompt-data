Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; if `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` equals 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
