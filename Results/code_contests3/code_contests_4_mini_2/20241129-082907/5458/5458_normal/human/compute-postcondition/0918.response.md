Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer (at least 2); `k` is 2; `i` is 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
