Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][4]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][4]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3][1] % mod` to its current value.***
