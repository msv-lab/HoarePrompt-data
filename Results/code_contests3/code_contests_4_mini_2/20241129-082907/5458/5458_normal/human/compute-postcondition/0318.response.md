According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates from 1 to `m`, and thus for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the initial state of `j` must be set to 1, as that is the starting value in the loop.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively; for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
