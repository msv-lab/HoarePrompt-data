The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3; `dp` is updated based on the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
