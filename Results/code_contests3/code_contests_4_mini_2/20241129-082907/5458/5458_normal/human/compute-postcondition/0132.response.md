According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. Given that `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and since `s` is at least 3, `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, and `k` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
