The line of code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The operation involves accessing two separate indices of the `dp` array: one for the original index with `k` reduced by `j`, and the other for the updated index with `j` increased by 1. The existing value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by this new value, while other variables remain unaffected. 

Thus, the output state reflects the change in the `dp` array based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
