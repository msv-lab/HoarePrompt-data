According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop executes for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, which means for it to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value (which is less than or equal to `s`), and for the next iteration to occur, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `k` is iterating from 1 to `s`, after the current iteration, `k` will be incremented to `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

Thus, if `s` is currently greater than or equal to `2`, `k` will be `2` in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `k` will be `2`**
