The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` is defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
