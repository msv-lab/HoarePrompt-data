Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, maintaining the conditions that `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.***
