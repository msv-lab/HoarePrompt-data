Since the given loop is `while 1:`, it is an infinite loop that will always execute again regardless of the program state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `dp` contains values derived from the complete iterations of the loops based on the conditions defined; the result of the expression `dp[n`**
