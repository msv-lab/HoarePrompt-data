The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. It does not alter the values of any variables in this context. Therefore, the Output State reflects that no changes have been made to the variables and that we are simply continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `k` is 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
