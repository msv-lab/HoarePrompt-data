Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and `dp[0][3][k]` is increased by `dp[1][2][k - 2] % mod`.***
