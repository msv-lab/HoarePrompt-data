According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates through the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value in the range, which means it is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is the stopping condition for the loop. 

Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` should be `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `N`, `M`, and `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` respectively, we can summarize the adjusted state as follows:

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1`.**
