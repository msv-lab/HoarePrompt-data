The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are defined values; `j` is `m + 1`; `S` is at least 1; `k` is 1 for the first iteration; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
