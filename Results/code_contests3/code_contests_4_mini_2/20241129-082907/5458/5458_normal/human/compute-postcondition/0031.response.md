According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it can execute `s` times. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, indicating that the loop has reached its upper limit and will not execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` would need to be incremented, which is not possible because it would exceed the value of `s`. Therefore, the loop cannot continue, and no new states need to be adjusted, because the condition for the loop to execute one more time (i.e., `k` being less than or equal to `s`) is not met.

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers. The loop cannot execute again as `k` is equal to `s`.**
