According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is currently at the last value used in the loop, which is 1 (since the loop starts at 1). To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
