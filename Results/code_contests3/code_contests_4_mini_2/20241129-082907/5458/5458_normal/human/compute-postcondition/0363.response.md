The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is `1`, we are accessing `dp[i & 1][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)]`, which involves checking the value at `k - j` where `k - j` could be negative depending on `m`. 

The overall impact on `dp` is that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will change based on the previous values of `dp`. The states of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the values of `k` and `j` remain unchanged, but the specific changes to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` depend on the current values in `dp`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
