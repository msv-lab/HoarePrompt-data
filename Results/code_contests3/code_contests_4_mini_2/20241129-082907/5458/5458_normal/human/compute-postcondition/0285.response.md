The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed. This causes the program to skip the remaining part of the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `k` is 1; `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
