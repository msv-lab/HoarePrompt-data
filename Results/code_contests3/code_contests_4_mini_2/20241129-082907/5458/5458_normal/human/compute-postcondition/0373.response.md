Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the relationship between `j` and `k`, influenced by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
