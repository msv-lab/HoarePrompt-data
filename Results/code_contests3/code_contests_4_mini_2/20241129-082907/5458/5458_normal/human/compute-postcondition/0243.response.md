According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. Since `j` starts at 2 (from the previous state) and the loop iterates from 1 to `m` (inclusive), the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `M` is at least 2 (and potentially greater), for the loop to execute a second time `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. 

So, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, which means `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is equal to `S`.**
