Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
