According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n ** 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value just before the next iteration, and `n`, `M`, and `S` are the input values provided. 

If the loop was able to execute until the current value of `i`, it means that `i` is currently less than `n ** 2`. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` must still be less than `n ** 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` as its current value,
- for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.

Thus, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must also be less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `dp` contains values derived from the complete iterations of the loops based on the conditions defined, `i` is `current_value + 1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
