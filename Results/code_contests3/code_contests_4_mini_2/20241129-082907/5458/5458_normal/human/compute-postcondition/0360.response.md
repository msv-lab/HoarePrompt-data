Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively; `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
