According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to run from `1` to `s + 1`, meaning it will iterate `s` times. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, since the loop starts with `k` at `1` and increments `k` by `1` with each iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be increased by `1`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if `k` is currently `s`, the next value of `k` will be `s + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means that after this iteration, `k` will be `s + 1`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are all greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be `1`, and after the iteration `k` will be `2`.**
