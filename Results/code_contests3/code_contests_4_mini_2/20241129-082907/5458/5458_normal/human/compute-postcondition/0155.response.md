Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to the maximum value of `k`, `i` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 2, and `j` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod`, with the value of `dp[0][2][0]` being unknown.***
