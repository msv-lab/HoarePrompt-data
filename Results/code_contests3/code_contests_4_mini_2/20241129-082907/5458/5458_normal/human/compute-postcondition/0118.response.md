The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
