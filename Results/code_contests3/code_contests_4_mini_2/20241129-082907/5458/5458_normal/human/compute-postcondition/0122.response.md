Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1; otherwise, there are no changes made to the program state. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
