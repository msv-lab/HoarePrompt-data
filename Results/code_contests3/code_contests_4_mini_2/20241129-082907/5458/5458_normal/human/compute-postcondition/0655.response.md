The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is incremented by 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
