The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop where this statement is located. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
