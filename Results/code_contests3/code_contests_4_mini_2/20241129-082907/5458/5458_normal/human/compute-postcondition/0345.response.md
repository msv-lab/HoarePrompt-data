The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the input value of `n`, `M` is the input value of `m`, `S` is the input value of `s` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.  
Output State: **`N` is the input value of `n`, `M` is the input value of `m`, `S` is the input value of `s` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.**
