Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1] filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer such that `k` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
