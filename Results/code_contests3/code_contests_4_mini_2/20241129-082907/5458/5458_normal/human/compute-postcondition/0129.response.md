The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` indicates that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i` and `k` are known, but `j` is not specified. The operation does not change the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or `k`, but rather updates the `dp` array based on the current indices.

Given:

- `i` is 2, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0 & 1`, which is `0`.
- The expression updates `dp[0][j + 1][k]` based on `dp[0][j][k]`.

Since `j` and `mod` are not specified in the initial state, the output state indicates that the `dp` array is updated, but we cannot define the exact values of `j + 1`, `j`, or `mod`. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed.

Output State: **`dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k] % mod`**.
