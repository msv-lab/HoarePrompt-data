The value of the variables does not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop since `continue` is executed. Given that the loop cannot execute again because `k` is equal to `S`, this indicates that we are at the end of the loop's execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers; the loop cannot execute again since `k` is equal to `S`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
