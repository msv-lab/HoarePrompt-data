The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop it is within. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `dp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
