According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached a value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `m + 1`. 

Since the loop iterates from `1` to `m`, and it has just completed the last valid iteration at `j = m`, for the loop to execute again, the condition must allow for `j` to be `m + 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` will be `m + 1`.
- The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain the same as they were input values and do not change with the loop execution.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. For the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `m + 1`.**
