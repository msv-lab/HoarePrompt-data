Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `s + 1`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
