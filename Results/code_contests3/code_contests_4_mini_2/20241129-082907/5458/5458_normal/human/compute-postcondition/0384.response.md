According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m`, meaning that the loop will not execute again unless `m` is increased. If `m` remains the same, the loop cannot execute a second time since the range for `j` would be exhausted.

However, if we were to consider the next potential state for the loop to execute again, we would need to increment `j` to `m + 1`. Since there is no next value for `j` in the current range, `m` must be increased for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are the input values, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be increased to allow `j` to take the value of `m + 1`.**
