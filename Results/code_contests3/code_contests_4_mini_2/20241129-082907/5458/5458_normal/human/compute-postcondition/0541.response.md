The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is used to calculate the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are all greater than 0; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are all greater than 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
