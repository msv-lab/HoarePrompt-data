According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, indicating that the loop has executed for `k = 1` and possibly `k = 2`. After this iteration, `k` is increased by 1.

Since `k` can execute one more time for values up to `S`, if the loop is to execute again, `k` will now be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
