The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` involves assigning a value to a multi-dimensional array (or list) `dp`. The array's indices are affected by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given:
- `N` is greater than 0
- `M` is greater than 0
- `S` is greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is greater than 0
- `j` is `M + 1`
- `k` is 1
- `j` is greater than `k`, so the loop continues to the next iteration

Now, since `j` is `M + 1` and `k` is 1, we know that `j > k` holds true. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but we know:
- `i` is at least 1 (since it's greater than 0),
- `j` is at least 2 (since `M` is greater than 0),
- `k` is 1.

The operation modifies the `dp` array, but without specific values of `dp` or `mod`, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we do know that:
1. The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
2. The state of other variables is not modified directly by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment occurring and the conditions of the variables that remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
