According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. 

Since the loop iterates from 0 up to `n ** 2 - 1`, after the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to the current value plus 1. 

Thus, we will have:
- `i` incremented by 1 (at least 1 now),
- The loop can execute again if `i` is at least less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined values; `m` is at least 1; `i` is at least 1; `j` is equal to `m + 1`; `k` is equal to `S + 1`; for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
