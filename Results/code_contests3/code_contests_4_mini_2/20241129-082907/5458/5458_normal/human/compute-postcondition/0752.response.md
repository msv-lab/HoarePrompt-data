According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, which is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `k` was `s`, the loop would not execute again, but if `k` is less than `s`, it will execute for `k + 1`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `dp` are defined values, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `s`, and the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`.**
