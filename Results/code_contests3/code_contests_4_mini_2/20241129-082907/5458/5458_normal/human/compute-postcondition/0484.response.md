Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0; `dp` values are updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k` during the iterations of the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` potentially being set to 1 or updated based on the previous `dp` values and modulo operations.**
