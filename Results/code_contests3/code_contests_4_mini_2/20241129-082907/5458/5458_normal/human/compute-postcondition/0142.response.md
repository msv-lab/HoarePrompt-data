According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` in relation to `M`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `M`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at 1 (as `j` starts from 1), and since `M` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`, which is still valid since `M` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to the maximum value of `k`, `i` is 2, `k` is `S`, `dp` array has been conditionally updated based on the loop logic, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 2.**
