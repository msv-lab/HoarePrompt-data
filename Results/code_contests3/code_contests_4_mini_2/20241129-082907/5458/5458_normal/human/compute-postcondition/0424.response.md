Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` has been updated at `dp[1][2][1] = 1`, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the condition is satisfied and the update to `dp` occurs.***
