Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
