The values of the variables do not change, but the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0; `k` is out of range for further loop execution; no changes to `dp`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
