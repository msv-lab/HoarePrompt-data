The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement will skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop it is contained in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
