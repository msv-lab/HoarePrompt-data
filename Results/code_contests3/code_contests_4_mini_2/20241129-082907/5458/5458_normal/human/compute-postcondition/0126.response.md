The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which equals 1. Therefore, both `dp[1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[1][j][k]` are being referenced. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we do not have the specific values of `j` or the `dp` structure. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, and the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`.**
