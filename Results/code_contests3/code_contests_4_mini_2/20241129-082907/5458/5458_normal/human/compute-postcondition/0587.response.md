According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. The state indicates that `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `m` are integers greater than 0, and `k` is initialized to `S + 1`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to `1`. 

Since `k` will be set to `1` during the first iteration, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least `1`. 

Given that `j` is incremented by `1` and the condition states that `m` must be greater than `j + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, we confirm that `j` should be adjusted accordingly.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute the first time are:
- `k` is `1` (since it starts from `1` in the loop),
- `s` must be at least `1`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is 1**
