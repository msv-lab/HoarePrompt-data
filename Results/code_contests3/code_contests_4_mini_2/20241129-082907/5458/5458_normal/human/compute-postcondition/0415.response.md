Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1, while if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
