The provided code snippet impacts the `dp` array by assigning the value from one of its previous states to a new position in the array. The indexing involves `i` and `j`, both of which are incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. 

The variable `i` is incremented by 1 and is now used with the expression `i + 1 & 1`, which will affect how the first index of `dp` is calculated based on `i`. The variable `j` is also incremented by 1 for accessing the second index of `dp`. 

Since `k` is 2, the loop will execute a second time, and `k` remains constant for this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
