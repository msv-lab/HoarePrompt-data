The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Here, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its previous value, and the modulus operation does not change the nature of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` since it is derived from an existing value. The loop's logic ensures that if `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment occurs based on the previous value.

Since the exact values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not specified, the output state indicates that the assignment occurs while reflecting the existing state of the involved elements.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, retaining its previous value.**
