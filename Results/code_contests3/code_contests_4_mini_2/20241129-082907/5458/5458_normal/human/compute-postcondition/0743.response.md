According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again for the second time, `k` must be incremented to 2. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2, and `k` must be less than or equal to `S`.**
