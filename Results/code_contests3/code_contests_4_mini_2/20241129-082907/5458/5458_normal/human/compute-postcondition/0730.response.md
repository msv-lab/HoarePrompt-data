According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s` (inclusive). For the loop to run at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the loop execution directly, but we need to ensure that `k` starts at 1. 

Given that `k` is initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `s`, we must confirm that `s` is set to a value that allows this to happen.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are that `s` must be at least 1, `k` starts at 1, and `k` will increment up to `s`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
