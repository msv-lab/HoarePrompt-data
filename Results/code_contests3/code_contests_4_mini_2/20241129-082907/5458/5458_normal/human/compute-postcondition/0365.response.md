According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` in the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have been equal to `s`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be equal to `s + 1`. 

Since `k` starts at `1` and increments by `1` with each iteration, after the last iteration where `k` was `s`, the next value for `k` would be `s + 1`. 

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `k` is now `s + 1`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged since they are input values and not affected by the loop execution.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be equal to `s + 1**
