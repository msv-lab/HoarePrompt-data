The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]` while continuing to the next iteration.
