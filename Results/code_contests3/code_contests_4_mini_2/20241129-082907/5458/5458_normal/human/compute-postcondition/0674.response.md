Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is initially 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
