The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `k` is `S`; `j` is `m + 1`; `s` is at least 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
