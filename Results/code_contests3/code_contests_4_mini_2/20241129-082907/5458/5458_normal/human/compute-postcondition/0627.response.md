According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes for `i` in the range of `n ** 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0, `n ** 2` would also be 0, resulting in the loop not executing.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
