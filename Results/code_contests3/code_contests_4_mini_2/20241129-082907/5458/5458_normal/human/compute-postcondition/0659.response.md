Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; if `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In both cases, `i` remains 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Additionally, `k` is the current value of `k + 1`.***
