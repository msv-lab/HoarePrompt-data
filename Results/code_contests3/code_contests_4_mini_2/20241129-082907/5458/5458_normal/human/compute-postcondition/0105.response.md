Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 4, and `s` is greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
