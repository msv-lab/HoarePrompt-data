The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
