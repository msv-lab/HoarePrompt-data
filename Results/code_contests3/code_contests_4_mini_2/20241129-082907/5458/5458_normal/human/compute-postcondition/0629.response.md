According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. Additionally, the values of `m`, `j`, and `i` need to be set as specified: `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is set to 1, and `i` is set to 0. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `s` must be at least 1,
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1,
- `j` is 1,
- `i` is 0.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
