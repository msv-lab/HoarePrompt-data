According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value, which is 1 less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop is defined to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`, we can determine that if `k` is currently `s`, then it will be incremented to `s + 1`, where it will no longer satisfy the loop condition.

The key states to adjust are `k`, which will be incremented by 1. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be incremented to 2, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
