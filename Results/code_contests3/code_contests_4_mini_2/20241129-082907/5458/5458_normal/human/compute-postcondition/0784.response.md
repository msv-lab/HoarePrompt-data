Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are incremented by 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, otherwise no updates are performed.***
