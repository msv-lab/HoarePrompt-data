According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `M`. The loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 2. Since `M` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 3. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is 3, and `M` must be at least 3 for this to occur.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k`, `i` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than or equal to `M`.**
