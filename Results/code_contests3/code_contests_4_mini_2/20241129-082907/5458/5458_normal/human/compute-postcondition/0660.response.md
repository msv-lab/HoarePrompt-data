Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is at least 0; `j` is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being either assigned the value `1` or updated based on the previous values in the `dp` array as per the logic of the loop.**
