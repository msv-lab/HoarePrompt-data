The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed with the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `dp` remain unchanged, as `continue` does not modify any variables directly. Therefore, the output state is: `N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0, and `S` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
