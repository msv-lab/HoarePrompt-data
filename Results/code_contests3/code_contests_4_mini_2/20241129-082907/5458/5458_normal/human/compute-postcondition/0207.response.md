Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is equal to or greater than `N`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to `M`, and `k` is equal to `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][M + 1][S]` is assigned the value of 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][M + 1][S]` is updated based on the values from previous iterations, involving the calculations with `dp` and `mod`.**
