The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from one element of the `dp` structure to another. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in the indexing. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` starts at 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1. Thus, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned a value.
2. The value of `j + 1` is 4 (since `j` is 3), so the assignment accesses `dp[1][4][k]`.
3. The value of `k` is 5, so `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` translates to `dp[1][3][5]`.

The output state reflects that the value at `dp[1][4][5]` is now equal to the value at `dp[1][3][5]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 5; dp[1][4][5] is assigned the value of dp[1][3][5]**.
