According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `i` (which will be 1) is still less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `M`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 0**
