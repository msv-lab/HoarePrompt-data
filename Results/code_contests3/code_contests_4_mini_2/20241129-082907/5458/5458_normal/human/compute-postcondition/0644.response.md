Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals 1.***
