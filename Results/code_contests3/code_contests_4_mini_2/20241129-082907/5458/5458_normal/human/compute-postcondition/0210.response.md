According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. Given that `M` is at least 2, this means that the loop will execute at least once. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`, after the first execution, `j` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, it must ensure that `m` is at least 2, which is already satisfied since `M` is at least 2. 

At the start of the second iteration, `j` will be 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `m` is at least 2**
