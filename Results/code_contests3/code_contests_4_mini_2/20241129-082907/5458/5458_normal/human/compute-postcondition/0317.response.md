According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n ** 2` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, which means `n` should be at least 1. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will start from 0. Therefore, to prepare for the loop's execution, the relevant states need to reflect that `n` is at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively; for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
