According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`, so it can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making `k` equal to 3. For the loop to be executed again, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 3, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, and `k` is 3.**
