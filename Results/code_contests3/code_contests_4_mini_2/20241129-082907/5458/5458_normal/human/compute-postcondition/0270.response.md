The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m` are integers, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
