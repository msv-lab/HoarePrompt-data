The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current context. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration or statement.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration or statement.**
