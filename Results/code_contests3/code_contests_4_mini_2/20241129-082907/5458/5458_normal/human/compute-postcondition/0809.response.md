According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
