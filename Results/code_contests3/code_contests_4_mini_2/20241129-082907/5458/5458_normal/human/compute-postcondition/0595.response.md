The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
