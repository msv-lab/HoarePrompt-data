According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `S + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `S` is greater than `0`. Given that `S` is greater than `0`, the loop is able to execute.

However, we should also consider the initial values of `k`. At the start of the first iteration of the loop, `k` will be `1`, as it is the starting value of the range defined in the for loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states should be noted:
- `N` is greater than 0 (no adjustment needed for the loop execution)
- `M` is greater than 0 (no adjustment needed for the loop execution)
- `S` is greater than 0 (this is required for the loop to run)
- `i` is `current_value + 1` (no adjustment needed for the loop execution)
- `j` is `M + 1` (no adjustment needed for the loop execution)
- `k` is `1` for the first execution of the loop

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
