Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3, `dp[1][4][3]` is updated with an unspecified value due to the unknown status of `dp` and `mod`.***
