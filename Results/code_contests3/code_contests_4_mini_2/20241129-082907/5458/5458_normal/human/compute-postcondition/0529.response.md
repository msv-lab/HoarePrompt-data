The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 2`, `k` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
