Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the function cannot access `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` due to a negative index.***
