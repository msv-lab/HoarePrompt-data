Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
