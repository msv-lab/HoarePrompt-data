The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 3, `j` is equal to 2, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
