Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is equal to `S`. The `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions met during the iterations, specifically with `dp[1][3][k]` being assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated according to the logic defined in the loop for the other cases. The final states of `dp` will depend on the values of `j` and the relationships between `k`, `j`, and `m`.**
