According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `M`. If `j` is less than or equal to `M`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 2. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its last value of 1 to 2. Therefore, the updated state must reflect that `j` is now 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 2.**
