The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[2][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][3][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[2][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][3][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
