According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the condition set by the range of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Given the range provided in the for loop statement, `k` can take values from 1 up to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` must be equal to 3 for the next iteration).

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 2**.
