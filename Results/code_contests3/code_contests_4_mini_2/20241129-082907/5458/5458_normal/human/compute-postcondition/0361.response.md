Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively; `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
