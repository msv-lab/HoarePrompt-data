Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are all equal to 2 or 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the dp array at index [1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1 without affecting the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, or `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to any variable or the dp array. In the else part, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, while the dp array is updated based on operations involving unknown values for `i` and `j`.***
