Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
