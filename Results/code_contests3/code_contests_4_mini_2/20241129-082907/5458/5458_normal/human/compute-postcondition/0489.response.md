The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial state, we have:

- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
- `j` is `M + 1`, which is greater than `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `M + 2`.
- `k` is `1`.

Therefore, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. 

The resulting index for `dp` becomes `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. This indicates that the value `1` is assigned to the element at that specific position in the `dp` array.

The other variables, including `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
