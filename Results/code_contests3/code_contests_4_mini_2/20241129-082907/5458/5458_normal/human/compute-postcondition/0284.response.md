The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which is `0`. This means the first index in `dp` is `0`.
2. The value of `j` is 4. Therefore, `j + 1` evaluates to `5`, which means the second index in `dp` is `5`.
3. The value of `k` is 1, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the statement assigns the value of `dp[0][5][1]` to `dp[0][j][k]`, which is `dp[0][4][1]`.

The states of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. However, `dp` is updated based on the previous computations.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `k` is 1; `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]`.**
