Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0, and `S` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
