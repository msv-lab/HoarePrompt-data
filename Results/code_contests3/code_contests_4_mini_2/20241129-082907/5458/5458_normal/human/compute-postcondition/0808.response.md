Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `k`, and `j` are defined values, with `j` equal to `m + 1`, `s` at least 1, and `k` equal to 1 for the first iteration. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
