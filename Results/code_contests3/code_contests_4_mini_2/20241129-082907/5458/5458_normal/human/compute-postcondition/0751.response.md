Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are defined values. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `dp` remain unchanged if `j` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` with the condition that `k` is equal to 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `S`.***
