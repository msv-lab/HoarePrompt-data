The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, and `dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
