Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
