Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are defined values. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with the condition that `k` is equal to 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `S`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
