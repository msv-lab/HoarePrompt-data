The line of code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, specifically the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are not directly affected by this assignment, so their states remain unchanged. The condition states that `j` is greater than `k`, which is established to be 2. Thus, `k` will take the value of 2. 

The output state will note the assignment taking place and the conditions leading to it, while also stating that the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `m` are all greater than 0; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
