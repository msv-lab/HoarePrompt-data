According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `k = s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` will be incremented to 2). 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m` are integers, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
