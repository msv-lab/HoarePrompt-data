According to the code, the loop will execute while `k` is within the specified range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will be 5 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `S` is at least 4, `s + 1` will be at least 5, allowing the next iteration to execute. The states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` is updated to 5.

The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, `k` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
