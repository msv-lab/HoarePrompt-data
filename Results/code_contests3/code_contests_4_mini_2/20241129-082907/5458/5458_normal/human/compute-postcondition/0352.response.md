According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` will be equal to `s`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be set to `m + 1`, and `k` should be initialized to 1, with `s` needing to be at least 1. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1**
