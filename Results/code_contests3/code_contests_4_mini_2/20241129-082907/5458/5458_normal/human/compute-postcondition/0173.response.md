Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][4]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][2] % mod` to its previous value, leaving `dp[1][3][4]` unchanged prior to that operation.***
