Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `j` are greater than 0, with `k` equal to 2 and `j` greater than 2 and less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the execution continues to the next iteration or statement.***
