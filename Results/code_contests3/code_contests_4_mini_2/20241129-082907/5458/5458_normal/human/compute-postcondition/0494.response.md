The code `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the loop it is in. Thus, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. The state of the program reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
