The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
