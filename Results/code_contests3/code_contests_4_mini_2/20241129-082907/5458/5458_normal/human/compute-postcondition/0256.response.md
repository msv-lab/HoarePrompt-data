Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[2][4][1]` remains unchanged, while `dp[0][4][1]` is updated based on `dp[1][3][-2] % mod`.***
