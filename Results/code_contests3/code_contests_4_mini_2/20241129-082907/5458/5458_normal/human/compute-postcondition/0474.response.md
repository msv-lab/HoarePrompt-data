Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is equal to `s`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`, but `k` is incremented to `s + 1`, which is out of range. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, but since `k` is out of range for further loop execution, we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
