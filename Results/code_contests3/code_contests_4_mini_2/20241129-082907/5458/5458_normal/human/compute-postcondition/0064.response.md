According to the code, the for loop executes based on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since the loop is defined to execute for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, if `k` equals `s` at the end of the previous iteration, it would have been the last iteration of the loop. 

To summarize, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` would need to be 2 (the next value after 1). However, since `k` is currently at `s`, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be greater than `s`**.
