The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no change to the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or any other variables, the output state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are the input values; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
