Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are defined with `S` greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
