Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the loop skips the current iteration due to `j` being greater than `k.***
