Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
