The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `k` is equal to `s`, the loop cannot execute again, meaning there are no changes to `i`, `j`, or `k`. The previous values of these variables do not affect the assignment, and the state of `dp` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers; `k` is equal to `s` and the loop cannot execute again. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
