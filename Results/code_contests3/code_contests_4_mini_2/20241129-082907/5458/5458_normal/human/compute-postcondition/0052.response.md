Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` contains values reflecting the cumulative results, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.`**
