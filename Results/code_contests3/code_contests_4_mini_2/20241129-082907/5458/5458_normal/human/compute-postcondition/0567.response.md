According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the limit `S`. The loop runs for `k` starting from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently some integer greater than 0, and since `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `k` is currently a value within that range, the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `j` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
