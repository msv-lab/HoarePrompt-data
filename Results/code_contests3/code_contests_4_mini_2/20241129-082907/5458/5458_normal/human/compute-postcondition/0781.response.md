Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `j`, `s`, and `i` are defined values. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any updates.***
