The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it indicates that the current iteration of the loop will end, and the next iteration will begin. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is 3; dp[0][3][3] is assigned the value of dp[0][2][3], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is 3; dp[0][3][3] is assigned the value of dp[0][2][3], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
