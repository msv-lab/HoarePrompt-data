The statement updates the `dp` array at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged, and since `j` is greater than `k`, it indicates that the loop continues without altering any variable values. Therefore, the output state reflects that the `dp` array has been updated, but `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers; `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
