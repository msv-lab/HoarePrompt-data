According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `j`, which iterates from 1 to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `M` since the loop runs while `j` is less than or equal to `M`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being `M + 1`. 

Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are all greater than 0 and do not directly affect the execution of the for loop in terms of its range, the only adjustment needed is for `j`. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will reflect that `j` is now `M + 1`, and `i` remains `current_value + 1`.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is `M + 1`**
