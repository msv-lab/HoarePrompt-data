Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][4]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the variables. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
