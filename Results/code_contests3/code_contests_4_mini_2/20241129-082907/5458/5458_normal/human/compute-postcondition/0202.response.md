The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 5; `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][5]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
