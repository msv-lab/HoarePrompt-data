Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where the values in `dp` are referenced accordingly.***
