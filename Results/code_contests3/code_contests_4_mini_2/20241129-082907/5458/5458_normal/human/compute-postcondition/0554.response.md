According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `S + 1`. Since `k` is currently `S + 1`, it means that the loop has already executed once, and it is now set to execute a second time. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` needs to be adjusted to 2, and also `j` must be updated to 2 to satisfy the condition that `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and it must be less than or equal to `m`**
