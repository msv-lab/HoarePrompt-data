According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `j`, which iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value before the next iteration begins. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must increment by 1.

Given that `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, at the end of the last iteration, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, if `j` was at `m` before the next iteration, the loop will not execute again. However, if `j` was less than `m`, it will increment to `j + 1`.

Since `S` is defined to be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is equal to `S`, we know that `k` will remain the same for the next iteration. 

Assuming that `j` was `m`, the loop cannot execute again, but if `j` was `m - 1`, `j` will become `m` in the next iteration. 

Thus, the states need to reflect this increment in `j`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m - 1, and now j is m.**
