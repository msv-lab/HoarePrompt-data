Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
