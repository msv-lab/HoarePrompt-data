According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value for the previous iteration, which is `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, but since `k` is already at `s`, the next value would be `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the condition must allow for `k` to be `s + 1`, which exceeds the current limit of `s`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values, for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than `s`, specifically `k` is `s + 1`.**
