The `continue` statement will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in, proceeding to the next iteration. However, since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `k`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to the maximum value of `k`, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
