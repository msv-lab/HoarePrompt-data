According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `S`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which makes `k` equal to 2. Since `S` is at least 2, `k` can be equal to 2 for the loop to run again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
