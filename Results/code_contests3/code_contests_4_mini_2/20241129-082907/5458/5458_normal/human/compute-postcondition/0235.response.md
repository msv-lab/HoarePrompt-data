Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value 1.***
