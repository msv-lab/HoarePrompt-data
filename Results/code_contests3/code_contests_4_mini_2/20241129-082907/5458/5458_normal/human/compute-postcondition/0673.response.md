The code assigns a new value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. It adds `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is initially 1, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is initially 1, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.**
