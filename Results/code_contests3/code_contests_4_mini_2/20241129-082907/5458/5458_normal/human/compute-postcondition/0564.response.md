The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. The only affected variable is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which now holds the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
