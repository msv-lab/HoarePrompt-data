The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multidimensional list or array `dp`. Here, `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, since `i` is `0`, thus `0 + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `4`, since `j` is `3`, thus `3 + 1` results in `4`.
3. The value of `k` is `3`, as given.

Therefore, the code assigns `1` to `dp[1][4][3]`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
