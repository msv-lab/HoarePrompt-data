According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `k` is at its current value, which must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, we need to set `k` to its next value.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `k` is incremented by 1.**
