According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and since the loop iterates from 1 to `m`, at the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to the current value which is `j`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `m` are integers greater than 0; `k` is equal to `S + 1`; `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than `j + 1`.**
