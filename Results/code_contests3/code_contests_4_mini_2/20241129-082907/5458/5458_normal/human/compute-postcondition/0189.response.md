According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. The state at the end of the previous iteration has `k` equal to 3, meaning the loop has already executed for `k` values 1, 2, and 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. 

Since `s` is at least 3 (given that `S` is at least 3), `k` will be less than or equal to `s` for the next iteration since `k` will now be 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 4 and `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 4.**
