Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer; `k` is `s`; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value 1 for all `j` satisfying this condition. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
