Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and the loop cannot execute again as `k` is equal to `S`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
