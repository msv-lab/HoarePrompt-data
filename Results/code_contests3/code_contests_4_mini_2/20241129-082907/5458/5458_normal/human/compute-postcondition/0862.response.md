Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer; `k` is equal to `S`; if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` will be set to 1; otherwise, for each `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, involving values from previous iterations modulated by `mod`.**
