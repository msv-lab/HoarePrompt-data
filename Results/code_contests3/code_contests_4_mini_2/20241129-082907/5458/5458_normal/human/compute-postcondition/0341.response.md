According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the limit set by `s`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its maximum value of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is outside the current range of the loop.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be `s + 1`.**
