The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without making any alterations to `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
