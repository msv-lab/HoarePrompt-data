According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the maximum value `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached a value of `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`, and since `k` is defined as `S`, it remains the same.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `k` is `S`; for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `m + 1`.**
