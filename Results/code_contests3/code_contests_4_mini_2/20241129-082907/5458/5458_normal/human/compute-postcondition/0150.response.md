The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` uses the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 2

Calculating `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` is `3`, and `3 & 1` results in `1` (3 in binary is `11`, and `1` in binary is `01`, so `11 & 01 = 01`).

Calculating `j + 1`:
- `j + 1` is `3`.

Therefore, we substitute these values into the expression:
- The left-hand side becomes `dp[1][3][2]`.
- The right-hand side is `dp[1][2][2]`.

This means we are assigning the value from `dp[1][2][2]` to `dp[1][3][2]`. The values of the other variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, and any potential values for `dp` are not affected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment that has occurred, while the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to the maximum value of `k`, `i` is 2, `k` is 2, `j` is 2; dp[1][3][2] is assigned the value of dp[1][2][2]**.
