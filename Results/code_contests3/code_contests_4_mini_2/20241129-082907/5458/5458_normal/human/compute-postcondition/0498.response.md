Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is `M + 1`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, accessing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` results in an invalid index access.***
