Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, but since `k` is out of range for further loop execution (as `k` is incremented to `s + 1`), we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
