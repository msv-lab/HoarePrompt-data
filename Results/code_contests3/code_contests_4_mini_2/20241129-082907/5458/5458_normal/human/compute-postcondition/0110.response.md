According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop will execute from `k = 1` to `k = S`, which means it will iterate exactly `S` times. Since `S` is a positive integer, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start, `i` is 2, which does not affect the loop execution since it is not used in the loop. The variable `j` is also not relevant to the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute the second time, `k` must be equal to 2. The first iteration will set `k` to 1, and for the second iteration, `k` will be set to 2.

Therefore, the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute the second time are that `k` is 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
