According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `S` is at least 3. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `S`.

Since `k` is currently 3 and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 4. For the loop to execute again, `S` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, and `j` is 2.**
