Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined values; `m` is at least 1; `i` is at least 0; `j` is equal to `m + 1`; `k` is equal to `S + 1`; `dp` is updated for all valid indices based on the loop logic, where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned values based on the conditions specified, leading to the final state of the `dp` array reflecting all computations based on the iterations performed.**
