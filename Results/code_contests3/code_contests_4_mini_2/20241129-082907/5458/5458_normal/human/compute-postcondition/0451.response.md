Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0, `dp` is updated based on the conditions and relationships defined in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `S`. The final state of `dp` will reflect the results of these updates across all iterations. `i` will be `current_value + 1`, and `j` will be up to `S + 1`.**
