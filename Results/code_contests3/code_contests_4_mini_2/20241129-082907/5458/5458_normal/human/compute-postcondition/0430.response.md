The line of code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are defined as `current_value + 1`, `1`, and `1` respectively. The operation affects the `dp` array but does not change the values of `i`, `j`, or `k` since they are set for the next iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
