The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. Since `k` is 1, we need to check if `k - j` is a valid index for the array, depending on the value of `j`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `m` are defined but not directly affected by this line of code.

The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are necessary for the calculation, but they are not specified. Therefore, without those, we cannot provide specific numerical values. However, we acknowledge that the operation modifies `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it**.
