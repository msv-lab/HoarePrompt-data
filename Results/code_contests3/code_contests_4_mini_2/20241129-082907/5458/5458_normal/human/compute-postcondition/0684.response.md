According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `S + 1`. The variable `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop until it reaches `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. 

Given that `S` is defined and is greater than or equal to 2, it follows that `k` can be 3 as long as `S` is at least 3. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be updated to 3. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 3.**
