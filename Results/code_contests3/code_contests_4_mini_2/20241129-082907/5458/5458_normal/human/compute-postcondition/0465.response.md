Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
