Postcondition: ***`N` is 2, `M` is 2, `S` is 2, `m` is 2, `k` is 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the dp array at index [1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1 without affecting the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, or `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to any variable or the dp array.***
