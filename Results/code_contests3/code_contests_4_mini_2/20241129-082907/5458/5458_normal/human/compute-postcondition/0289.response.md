Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][1]` is updated to 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
