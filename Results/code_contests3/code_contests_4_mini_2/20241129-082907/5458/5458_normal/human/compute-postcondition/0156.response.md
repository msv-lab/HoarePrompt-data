According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` values ranging from 1 to `S` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2, so to execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. The loop will continue as long as `k` remains less than or equal to `S`.

Given that `S` is equal to the maximum value of `k`, which is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `S` must be greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, we also note that `j` is equal to 2, which is less than `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 3, and `j` is equal to 2, for the loop to execute a third time.**
