According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` from 1 to `S`. Given that `k` is currently 1 at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop has executed once for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Since `S` is a positive integer that is at least 2, in order to execute the loop a second time, `k` must be 2 for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
