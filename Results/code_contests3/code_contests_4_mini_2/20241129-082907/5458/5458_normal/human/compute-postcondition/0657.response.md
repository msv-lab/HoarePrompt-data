The given code snippet assigns a value to a multidimensional array `dp` based on previous values of the same array. Specifically, it updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. 

While `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `i`, `s`, and `mod` are defined variables, the exact values of these variables are not provided. However, the operation involves the modulo operation, which will give a value based on the current state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` before the assignment.

Since the values of `dp`, `mod`, and the specific indices are not given, the output state cannot specify exact values. Thus, the impact of the code is that it modifies the `dp` array without changing the other variables. 

The output state reflects that the array `dp` is updated based on its previous state, but without concrete values for `dp`, `mod`, or the indices, a specific numerical output cannot be provided.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
