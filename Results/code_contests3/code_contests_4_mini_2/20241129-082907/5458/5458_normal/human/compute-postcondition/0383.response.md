Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values. `dp` has been updated based on the conditions set by the loop, specifically reflecting the relationships between `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for any iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1; otherwise, it will depend on the values from the previous iterations, particularly influenced by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
