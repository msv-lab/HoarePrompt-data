According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. Since `m` is defined as at least 1, the loop will execute at least once when `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to 1 and will increment until it reaches `m + 1`, meaning it will iterate for values from 1 to `m`. 

Given that `i` is at least 1 and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, we should ensure that `n` is greater than `i` for the loop to execute.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `j` is initialized to 1, the first value in the range.
- For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined values, `m` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `n` must be greater than `i`**
