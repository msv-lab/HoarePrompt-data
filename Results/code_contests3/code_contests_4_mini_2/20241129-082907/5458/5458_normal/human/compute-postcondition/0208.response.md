Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k`, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `M`, and for each `k` from 1 to `S`, `dp[1][M + 1][k]` is updated based on the values from previous iterations, with `dp[1][M + 1][S]` being 1 if `M >= S`.**
