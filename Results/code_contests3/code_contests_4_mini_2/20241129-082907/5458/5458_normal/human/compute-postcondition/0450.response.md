Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0 and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no assignment occurs. If `i` is not 0 and `s` is at least 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
