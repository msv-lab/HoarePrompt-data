According to the code, the loop iterates a total of `n ** 2` times. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n ** 2`, which is outside the current range of the loop. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n ** 2`.

To summarize:
- `N`, `M`, `S`, and `m` are unchanged.
- `k` remains `S`.
- The loop will not execute again since `i` will equal `n ** 2`, which is not less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `k` is `S`; for the loop to execute a next time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, but it will be `n ** 2` after the last iteration.**
