Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is equal to 0, and `k` is 5. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is updated to 4, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned the value of `1`. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][5]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3][2] % mod`.***
