Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `S`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of `i` and `j` for all `k` from 1 to `S`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for those values. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` accumulates values based on previous states of the `dp` array.**
