The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged. The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` does not get updated during this execution because the code execution jumps to the next iteration before reaching any assignment statements. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, and `S` are unchanged; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are unchanged; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
