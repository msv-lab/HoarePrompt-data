According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `S`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `S` is a positive integer that is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the condition must hold that `k` is less than or equal to `S`, which means `S` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3.**
