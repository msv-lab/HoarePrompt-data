The code `continue` does not change any variable values directly; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continues to the next iteration. Thus, the values of `N`, `M + 1`, `S`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are defined, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
