According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `S` is defined and is greater than or equal to 1, `k` can take the next value of 2.

The loop condition states that it runs while `k` is less than or equal to `S`. Since `k` is currently 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2 and must remain within the bounds defined by `S`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2**
