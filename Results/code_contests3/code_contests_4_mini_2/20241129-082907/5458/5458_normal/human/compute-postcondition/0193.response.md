The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; however, it causes the execution to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop. Since there are no variables being modified directly by this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, `k` is equal to 4; `dp[1][4][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][4]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
