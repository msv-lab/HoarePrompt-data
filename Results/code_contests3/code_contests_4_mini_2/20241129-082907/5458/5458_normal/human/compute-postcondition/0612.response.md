The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves assigning a value from one index of the `dp` array to another index based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i + 1 & 1` computes the next value of `i` adjusted by the bitwise AND operation with `1`, which will yield either `0` or `1`.
2. `j + 1` simply increments `j` by 1.
3. `k` remains unchanged in this assignment.

The specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, and `j` are not provided, but we know they are integers. The assignment updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` using the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, meaning no new values are introduced, only existing ones are reassigned.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the indices in the `dp` array have been modified based on the indexed values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j` are integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
