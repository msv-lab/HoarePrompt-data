The code `continue` is executed, which means that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the control moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `k`, `j`, and `dp[1][3][4]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][4]`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][4]`.**
