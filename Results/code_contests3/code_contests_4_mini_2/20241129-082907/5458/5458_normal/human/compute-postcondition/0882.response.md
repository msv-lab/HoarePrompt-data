Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and no variable values are changed. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no operations are performed.***
