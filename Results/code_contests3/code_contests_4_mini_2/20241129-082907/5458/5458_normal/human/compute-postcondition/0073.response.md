Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2. The `dp` array is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, reflecting cumulative results across all iterations from `k = 1` to `S`, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` set to either 1 or updated by adding previous values from `dp` as per the loop logic.**
