The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly but affects the flow of control in the loop. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. The code indicates that we are skipping the rest of the statements in the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
