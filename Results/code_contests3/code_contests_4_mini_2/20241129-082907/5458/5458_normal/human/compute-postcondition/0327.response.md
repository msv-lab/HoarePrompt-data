Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively; for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
