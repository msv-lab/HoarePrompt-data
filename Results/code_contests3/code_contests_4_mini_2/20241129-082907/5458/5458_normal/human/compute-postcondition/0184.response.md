The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds with the next iteration of that loop. However, the values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][4][3]` remain unchanged because the statement does not alter their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
