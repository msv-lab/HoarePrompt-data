According to the code, the loop controlled by `k` will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on the next value in this range. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 3. 

We also need to ensure that `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. We already know from the previous iteration that `S` is greater than or equal to 2, thus `s` must be at least 3 for `k` to be 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
