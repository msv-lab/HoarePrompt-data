The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values, `s` is a positive integer (at least 2), `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
