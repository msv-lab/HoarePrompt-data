The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, so `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 1 or 0 depending on the value of `i`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j + 1` will be the new value of `j`. The value of `k` remains unchanged in this specific line of code. The states of `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is incremented by 1; and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is incremented by 1; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
