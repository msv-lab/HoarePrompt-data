Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp` is updated at `dp[1][2][1] = 1` and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the update to `dp` occurs. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
