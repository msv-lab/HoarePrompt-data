The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `dp` is being updated based on its previous state, specifically using the values of `dp` for indices derived from `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the initial state describes an assignment and the code provides an update, we can summarize the impact:

1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
2. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not directly provided, so we focus on the change.

Thus, we can conclude that the state of `dp` for these indices has changed accordingly.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
