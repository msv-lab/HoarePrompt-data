Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration without modifying any values; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
