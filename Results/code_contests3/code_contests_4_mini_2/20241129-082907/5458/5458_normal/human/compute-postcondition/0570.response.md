The operation assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged, but we note that `dp` at a specific index is being updated based on the previous value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `j` are integers greater than 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `j` are integers greater than 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
