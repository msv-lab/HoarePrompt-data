Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m` are integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, allowing the loop to execute a second time if `s` is at least 2 and `k` is 2. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on its previous values.***
