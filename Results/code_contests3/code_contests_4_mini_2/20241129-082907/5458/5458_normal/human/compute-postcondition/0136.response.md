The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
