Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and `k` are incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration.***
