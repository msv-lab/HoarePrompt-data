According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `k` is currently at its maximum value, which is `s`, the loop will not execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, allowing for another iteration.

Assuming `k` was last set to some value less than `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should increase by 1. Therefore, if the loop is currently executing with `k`, on the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, that is `k + 1`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `j`, `s`, and `i` are defined values, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
