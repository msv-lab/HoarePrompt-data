The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the operation is performed modulo `mod`. The impact is that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now defined in terms of previous computations in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
