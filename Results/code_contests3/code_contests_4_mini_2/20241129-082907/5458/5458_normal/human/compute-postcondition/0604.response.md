The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are integers; `k` must be incremented to 2, and `S` must be greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
