According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1, since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `m + 1`. The variable `j` will take values starting from 1. 

Given the conditions, if `m` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `dp` do not directly impact the loop execution in this case. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to 1 for the first execution.

State: **`N`, `M` is greater than 0, `S`, `dp`, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
