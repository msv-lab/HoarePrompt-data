Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
