Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which is 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is at least 1 and not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` is set to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
