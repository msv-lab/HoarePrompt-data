According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, changing its value to 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n ** 2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds, `dp` contains values determined by the loop logic, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
