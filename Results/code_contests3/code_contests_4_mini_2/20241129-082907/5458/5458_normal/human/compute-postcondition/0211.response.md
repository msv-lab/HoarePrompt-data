According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` takes values from `1` to `S` (inclusive). For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least `2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer (not directly relevant for loop execution),
- `M` is at least `2` (not directly relevant for loop execution),
- `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k` (ensures the loop can run up to at least `2`),
- `i` is `1` (not directly relevant for loop execution),
- `j` is `2` for the loop to execute a second time (not directly relevant for loop execution),
- `m` is at least `2` (not directly relevant for loop execution).

To execute the loop a second time, it is necessary that `S` is at least `2` so that `k` can take the value of `2` after the first iteration.

Therefore, the state should reflect that `k` starts at `1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be `2` during its second iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2**
