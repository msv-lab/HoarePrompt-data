According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to and including `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be `m + 1`. For the loop to execute another time, `j` must be reset to 1 for the next iteration, and `m` should still be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `k` is `S`; for the loop to execute the next time `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is reset to 1**
