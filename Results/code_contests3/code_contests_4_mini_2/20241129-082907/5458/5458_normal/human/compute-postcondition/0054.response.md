Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with `M` and `S` greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp` is updated at position [1][j + 1][1] to 1, with `k` remaining 1 for the first iteration. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
