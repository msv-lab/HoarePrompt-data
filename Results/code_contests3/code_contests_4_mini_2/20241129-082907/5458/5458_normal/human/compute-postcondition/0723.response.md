Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are defined with `S` greater than or equal to 2; if `j` is greater than 3, the values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` but the previous values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged.**
