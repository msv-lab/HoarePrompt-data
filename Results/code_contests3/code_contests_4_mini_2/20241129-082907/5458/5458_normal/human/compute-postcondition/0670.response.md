The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is initially 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
