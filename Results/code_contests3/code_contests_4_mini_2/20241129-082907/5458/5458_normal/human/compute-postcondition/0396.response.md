The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, but `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified. Since `k` is 1, `k - j` will be `1 - j`. The output state reflects the updated value at `dp` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
