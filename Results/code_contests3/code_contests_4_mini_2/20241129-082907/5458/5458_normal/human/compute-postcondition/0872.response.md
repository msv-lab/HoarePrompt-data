Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration without any variable changes.**
