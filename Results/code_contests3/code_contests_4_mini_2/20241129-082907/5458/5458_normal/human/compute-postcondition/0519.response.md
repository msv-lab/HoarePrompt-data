According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `current_value + 1`, and since `N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0, we know that the values of `i` are increasing in each iteration until it reaches `n ** 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Given that `i` is currently `current_value + 1`, to execute another iteration, it must be that `current_value + 1` is less than `n ** 2`, meaning `current_value` must be less than `n ** 2 - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be equal to `current_value + 1 + 1`, which is `current_value + 2`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are greater than 0, `i` is `current_value + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be such that `current_value` is less than `n ** 2 - 1`**
