According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, allowing `k` to take the value of 1 on the first iteration. Since we are considering the state where the loop is supposed to execute one more time, this indicates that `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `k` should be adjusted to reflect the first iteration of the loop. 

State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 1, `k` is 1**
