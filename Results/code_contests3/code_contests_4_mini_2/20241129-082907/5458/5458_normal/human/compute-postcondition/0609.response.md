According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates over `k`, starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. 

Since the loop is structured to iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, if `k` is currently less than `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently a certain integer within the bounds of the loop, and to execute once more, `k` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, if `k` is incremented, it should be equal to `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `m`, `j` are integers. If `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `S`.**
