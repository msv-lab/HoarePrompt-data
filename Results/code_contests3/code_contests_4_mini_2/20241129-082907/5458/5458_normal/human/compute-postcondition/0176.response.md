According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `S` (inclusive). To ensure that the loop executes a third time, `k` must take on the values 1, 2, and 3, which means that `S` needs to be at least 3. The current state indicates that `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than the final value of `k`, but it does not specify its exact value. Therefore, `S` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` will be 3 during this iteration.

The current values of `i` and `j` do not affect the execution of the loop, but we must ensure that the loop can execute three times by confirming that `S` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 3, for the loop to execute a third time `S` must be at least 3 and `k` is now 3**
