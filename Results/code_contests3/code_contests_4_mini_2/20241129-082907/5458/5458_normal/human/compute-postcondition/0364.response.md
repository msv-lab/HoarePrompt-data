Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are the input values. If `j` (which is `M + 1`) is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then `dp[1][M + 2][1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][M + 2][1]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
