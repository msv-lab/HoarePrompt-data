The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves some operations on the indices of a 3D array `dp`. 

1. `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value of `i + 1` (which is 3) and applies a bitwise AND operation with 1. Since 3 in binary is `11`, `3 & 1` results in `1`.
2. `j + 1` calculates the value of `j + 1` (which is 3).
3. `k` is already defined as `3`.

Putting it all together, the operation `dp[1][3][3] = 1` sets the value of the `dp` array at the indices `[1][3][3]` to `1`. 

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is 2, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.**
