The code assigns the value `1` to the element in the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The current values of the variables are `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 5. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. Therefore, the assignment will be made to `dp[1][4][5]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are: 
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3 (which will become 4 when incremented by 1)
- `k` remains 5

No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 5, and `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned the value of `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 5, and `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned the value of `1`.**
