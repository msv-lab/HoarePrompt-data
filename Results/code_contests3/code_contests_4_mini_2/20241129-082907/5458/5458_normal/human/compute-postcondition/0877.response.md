According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1` based on the variable `k`. If `k` starts at 1, the loop will execute for `k` values of 1 through `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the next value of `k` will be 2.

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be equal to 2. Since `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to run again.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values; `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2**
