Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `S`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][S]` is assigned the value 1 for all valid `j`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values in the array, specifically `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The final state will reflect the accumulated values in `dp` based on the iterations performed on `k` from 1 to `S`.**
