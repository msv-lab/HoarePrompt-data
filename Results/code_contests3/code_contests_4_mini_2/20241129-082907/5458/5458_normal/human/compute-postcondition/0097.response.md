According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4 to ensure that `k` is still within the valid range (1 to `s + 1`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 4, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
