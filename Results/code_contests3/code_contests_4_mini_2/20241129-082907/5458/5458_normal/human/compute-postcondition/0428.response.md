The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][1]`, `i` is `current_value + 1`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
