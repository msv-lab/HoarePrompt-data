The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop in which it resides. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
