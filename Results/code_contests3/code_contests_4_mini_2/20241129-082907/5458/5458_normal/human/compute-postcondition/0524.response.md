The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3D array `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices. 

1. The current value of `i` is `current_value + 2`, but it is also stated that `i` is equal to 0. This implies that `current_value` must be -2 for both conditions to hold true.
2. The value of `j` is 1, and `k` is also 1.
3. Now, let's compute the indices:
   - For `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 0, this evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which results in `1 & 1 = 1`.
   - For `j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this evaluates to `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For `k`: This remains 1 as it is unchanged.

The assignment `dp[1][2][1] = 1` indicates that the value at the specified index in the 3D array `dp` is set to 1. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.**
