The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the input value of `n`, `M` is the input value of `m`, `S` is the input value of `s`, `dp` contains values determined by the loop logic, `i` is equal to `N^2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
