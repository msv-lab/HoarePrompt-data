The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
