The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the current state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the modulus operation with `mod`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the relevant `dp` values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
