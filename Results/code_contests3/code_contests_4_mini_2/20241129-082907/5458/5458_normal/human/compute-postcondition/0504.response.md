Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0 and at least 2 respectively. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we proceed to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
