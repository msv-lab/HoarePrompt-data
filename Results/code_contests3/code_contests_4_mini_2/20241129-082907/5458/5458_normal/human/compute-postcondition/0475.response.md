According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, which means it is currently at the upper limit for the loop. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` would need to be incremented to `s + 1`, but since this would be out of range for the loop condition (which runs from `1` to `s`), the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, to summarize the state for the next iteration:
State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to 0; `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which is out of range for further loop execution.**
