According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` from 1 to `S` (inclusive). The current value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `S` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. Specifically, in the next iteration, the value of `k` will be 2. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` will be updated to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `S`.**
