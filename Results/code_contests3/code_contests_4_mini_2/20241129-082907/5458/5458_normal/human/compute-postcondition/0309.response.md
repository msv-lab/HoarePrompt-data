Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `M + 1`, `m` is at least `M + 1`, `k` is equal to `S`, and the `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions met during the iterations, specifically reflecting the relationships between `j`, `k`, and the logic defined in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `M` and for all values of `k` from 1 to `S`.**
