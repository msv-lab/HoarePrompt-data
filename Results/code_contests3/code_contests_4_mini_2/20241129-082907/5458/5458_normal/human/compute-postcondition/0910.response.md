According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is a positive integer (at least 1). For the loop to execute again, `k` will increment by 1, making `k` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are defined values, `s` is a positive integer (at least 2), `k` is 2, and `i` is 0.**
