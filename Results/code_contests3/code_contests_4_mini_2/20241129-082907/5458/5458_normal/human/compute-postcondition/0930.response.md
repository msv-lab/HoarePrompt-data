Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined values; `m` is at least 1; `dp` is updated for all valid indices based on the loop logic, reflecting the results of the nested loop computations, with `dp[0][j][k]` and `dp[1][j][k]` containing values influenced by the conditions specified and previous states of `dp`.**
