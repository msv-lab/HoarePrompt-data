Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than or equal to 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while skipping the rest of the current loop iteration.***
