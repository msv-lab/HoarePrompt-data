The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 2, `M` is 2, `S` is 2, `m` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is 2, `M` is 2, `S` is 2, `m` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
