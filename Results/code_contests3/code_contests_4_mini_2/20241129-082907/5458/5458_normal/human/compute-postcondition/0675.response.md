According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `S` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will increment by 1 to become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `S` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are defined, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2**
