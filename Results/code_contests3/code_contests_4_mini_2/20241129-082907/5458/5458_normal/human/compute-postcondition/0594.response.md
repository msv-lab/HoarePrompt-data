The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific operation `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which will yield `1` if `i + 1` is odd and `0` if `i + 1` is even. This operation affects the indexing of the `dp` array.

Since `i` is greater than 0, `i + 1` is at least 2, hence `i + 1 & 1` will always be `0` when `i` is odd and `1` when `i` is even. 

The values of `j`, `k`, and `dp` arrays will remain unaffected except for the specific index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which will now hold the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. However, without specific values for these indices, we cannot determine exact values.

Therefore, the output state describes the change in the `dp` array based on the operation applied, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `M` is greater than 0, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
