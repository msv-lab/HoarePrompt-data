According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop starts at `j = 1` and goes up to `m`, after the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be `m + 1` (which is the next value after the last valid index).

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are greater than 0; `i` is greater than or equal to 0; `j` is `m + 1`; for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to `m`**
