Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are defined variables; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `j` is incremented by 1; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; `s` is greater than or equal to 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 (given that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`), and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
