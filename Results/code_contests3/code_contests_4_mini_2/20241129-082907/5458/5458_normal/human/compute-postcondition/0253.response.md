Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[2][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][3][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
