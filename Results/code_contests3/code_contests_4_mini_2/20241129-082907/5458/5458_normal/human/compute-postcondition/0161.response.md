Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer equal to or greater than 3, `i` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 3, and `j` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
