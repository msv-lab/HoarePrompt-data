According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is set to 100000.**
