Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `k` is 4, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the program.***
