The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes input data with the constraints that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000). The input processing terminates when all three values `N`, `M`, and `S` are 0. The function handles a maximum of 5 datasets.

Since the output behavior based on the input values is not specified in the provided information, we can only describe the parameters and termination condition.

Functionality: **The function processes input datasets consisting of three positive integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7, M is between 1 and 2000, and S is between 1 and 3000. The input processing terminates when N, M, and S are all 0, and the function can handle up to 5 datasets.**
