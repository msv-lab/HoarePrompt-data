Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` and a positive integer `s`, followed by `n` pairs of integers (`fi`, `ti`). It calculates the total time passed based on the sorted order of `fi` values in descending order and the conditions set by `ti`. The function then prints the total time passed, which is derived from the values of `s` and the conditions in the loop. It implicitly handles the case where no passengers are provided by including a tuple (0, 0) to ensure the calculation proceeds without error. **
