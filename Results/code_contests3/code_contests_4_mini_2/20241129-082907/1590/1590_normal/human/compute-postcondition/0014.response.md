The variable `time_passed` is initialized to `0`. The other variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and now includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is `n`; `time_passed` is 0.
