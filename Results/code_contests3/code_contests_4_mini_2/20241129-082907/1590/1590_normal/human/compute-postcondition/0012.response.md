The tuples in `p` are sorted based on the first element of each tuple (`fi`) in descending order. The value of `n` determines how many tuples are present in `p`, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, the sorting will affect the order of these tuples. The second element of the tuples (`ti`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the sorted order of `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order; `i` is `n`.**
