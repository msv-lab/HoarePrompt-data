According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` will increment by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

Since the loop is designed to run `n + 1` times, and `i` will now be 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still satisfy the condition that it is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is 0, `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and includes the tuple (0, 0), `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must still be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100.**
