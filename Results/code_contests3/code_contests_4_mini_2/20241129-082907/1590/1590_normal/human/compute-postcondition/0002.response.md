According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 as it is commonly used as the loop index in such constructs. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
