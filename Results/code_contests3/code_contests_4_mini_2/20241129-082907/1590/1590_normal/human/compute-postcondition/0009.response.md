The variables `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input, which is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are not known before this line of code. Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop continues, but the states of `n`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the input assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, and `fi`, `ti` are assigned from input.**
