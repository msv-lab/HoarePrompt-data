The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned based on user input, which means they can take on any values as determined by the user's input. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the inclusion of the new tuple in the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti); `i` is 0.**
