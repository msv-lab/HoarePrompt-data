The loop reads input values for `fi` and `ti` and appends them as tuples to the list `p`. The loop executes `n` times, which means it will gather `n` tuples of values. After all iterations, the list `p` will contain `n` tuples, each corresponding to the input values read during each iteration. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 1000, after the loop has executed:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` contains `n` tuples of the form (fi, ti); `i` is `n`.**
