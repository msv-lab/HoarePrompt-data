According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
