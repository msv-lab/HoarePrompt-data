`p` is updated by appending the tuple `(fi, ti)` to it. The initial values of `fi` and `ti` are provided through input, and `p` is affected by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 1; `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 1; `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input values.**
