The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, based on the constraints provided, it operates on certain values that are presumably inputted through other means, such as standard input or within the function body itself. 

The function is designed to handle a scenario involving positive integers. Specifically, it works with the following constraints:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `s` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq 1000\).
- For each of the next `n` lines, there are two integers `fi` and `ti` such that \(1 \leq fi \leq s\) and \(1 \leq ti \leq 1000\).

The output of the function, while not specifically defined in the provided details, is implied to process these inputs and produce a result based on them. Since there are no specific return cases outlined, we will not break them down further.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on positive integers `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti` based on specified constraints, with an implied output based on these inputs.**
