Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and includes the tuple (0, 0), `i` is 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is set to `p[i][1]`.***
