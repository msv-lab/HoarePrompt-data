The code appends the tuple (0, 0) to the list `p`. The values of other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The state of the variable `p` will now include an additional tuple at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order, and now includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and now includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is `n`.**
