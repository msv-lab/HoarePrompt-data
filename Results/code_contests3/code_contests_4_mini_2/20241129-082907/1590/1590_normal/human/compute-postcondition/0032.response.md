Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is the value of `p[n][0]`; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is `n`; `time_passed` is the total accumulated value after all iterations, which is at least `p[n][1]` or more depending on the conditions met during the loop; the value of `time_passed` is printed.**
