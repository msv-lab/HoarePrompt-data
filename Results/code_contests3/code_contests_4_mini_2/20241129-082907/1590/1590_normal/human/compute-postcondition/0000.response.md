The values of `n` and `s` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which accepts two integers separated by a space. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, the values of `n` and `s` will be determined from this input. Other variables (`fi` and `ti`) are not affected at this point, as they have not yet been assigned any values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000**
