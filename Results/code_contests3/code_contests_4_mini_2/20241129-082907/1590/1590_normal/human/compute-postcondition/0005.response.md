According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means that the loop has executed for the first time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti); `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
