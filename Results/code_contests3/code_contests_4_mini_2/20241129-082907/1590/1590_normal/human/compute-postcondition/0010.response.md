The command `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided by user input. Therefore, after executing this line, the list `p` will now contain the previous elements along with the newly added tuple. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` now includes the previous tuples plus the new tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 2; `fi`, `ti` are assigned from input.**
