Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, which is 0; `p` includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is 2; and `time_passed` remains unchanged. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, which is out of range, then the state of the program remains as described, with no updates to `s` or `time_passed`.***
