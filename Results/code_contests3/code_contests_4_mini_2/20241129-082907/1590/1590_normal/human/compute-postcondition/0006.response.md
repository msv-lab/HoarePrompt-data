The variables `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which splits the input string and converts each part to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `p` are unchanged as it is a tuple. The variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected by this input operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new values for `fi` and `ti` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000; `p` contains the tuple (fi, ti); `i` is 1; `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input values.**
