The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between the second element of the tuple `p[i]` and the current value of `time_passed`. The initial value of `time_passed` is \(0\), and since `p` includes the tuple \((0, 0)\), the second element of `p[i]` when \(i = 0\) is \(0\). Therefore, the calculation is:

\[
time\_passed += 0 - 0 \implies time\_passed = 0
\]

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is 0; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is 0; `time_passed` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `s` is 0; `p` is sorted based on the first element of the tuples in descending order and includes the tuple (0, 0); `i` is 0; `time_passed` remains 0.**
