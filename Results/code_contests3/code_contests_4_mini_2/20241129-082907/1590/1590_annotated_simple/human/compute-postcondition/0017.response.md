The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. Here, `i` is `n - 1`, which means we are accessing the `(n - 1)`-th tuple in the sorted list `p` and taking its first element. As `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the value of `i` will range from 0 to 99. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `p` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n - 1`; `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order; `s` is assigned the value of `p[n - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n - 1`; `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order; `s` is assigned the value of `p[n - 1][0]**
