The code `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged and are not affected by this operation. Since `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input, they hold specific values but the exact values are not known. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, along with the new state of the list `p` after appending the tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `p` now contains (fi, ti)**
