According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` represents the number of passengers and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 in the first iteration of the loop. Since `p` is an empty list and does not affect the execution of the loop itself, we do not need to adjust it.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
