According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
