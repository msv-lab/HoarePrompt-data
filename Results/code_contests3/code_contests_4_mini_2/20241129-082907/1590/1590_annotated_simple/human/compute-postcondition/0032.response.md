Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order; `s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`; `time_passed` is equal to the maximum of `p[i][1]` and the accumulated time from all previous iterations; the value of `time_passed` is printed.**
