The code assigns the values from the input to `fi` and `ti` using the `map` function to convert them into integers. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are not known since they are being assigned based on user input. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Thus, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are now assigned based on input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned from input**.
