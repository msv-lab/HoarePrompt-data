The code initializes an empty list `p`. Since this code does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `fi`, or `ti`, the state of these variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `p` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `p` is an empty list**
