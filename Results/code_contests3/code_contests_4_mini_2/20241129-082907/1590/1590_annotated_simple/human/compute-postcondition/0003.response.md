The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` using the `map` function, which applies `int` to each value obtained from `raw_input()`. The variables `fi` and `ti` will be assigned the values of two integers inputted as a string separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are obtained from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are obtained from user input**
