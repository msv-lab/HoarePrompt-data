The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading from input and mapping them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment, and since `raw_input()` accepts two space-separated values, `fi` and `ti` will take those values. The initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 100 and `i` is 1, but without specific input values, we cannot determine the exact values of `fi` and `ti`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are now assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input**.
