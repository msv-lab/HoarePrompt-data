The value of `time_passed` is incremented by `s - p[i][0]`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, thus `i` can range from 2 to 101. The variable `p` is an array or list, and the specific value of `p[i][0]` depends on the contents of `p` at index `i`. The value of `s` is not defined in the initial state. As a result, we cannot determine the exact change for `time_passed` without knowing `s` and the content of `p`. 

Therefore, the Output State remains as is without any specific update to `time_passed` or other variables beyond noting that `i` is `n + 1` and that we are performing an operation involving `s` and `p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n + 1`, and `time_passed` is incremented by `s - p[i][0]`.**
