The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from user input but are not specified here, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, the state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, and `p` now contains an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, and `p` now contains an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`**
