The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the value of `s` will depend on the specific values in the `p` array at the index `i`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `p[i][0]`, but it indicates that `n` is between 1 and 100, which means `i` will be between 2 and 101.

Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n + 1`; `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]**
