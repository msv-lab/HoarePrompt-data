According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n + 1`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `i` is currently `n`, the state for the next iteration must reflect this increment. 

Furthermore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be between 1 and 100, and since `i` will be `n + 1` after the increment, it satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n + 1`**
