The code `p.append((0, 0))` adds a new tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. The state of `n` and `i` remains the same, and `p` will now contain one additional tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, and a new tuple (0, 0) has been added to `p`.**
