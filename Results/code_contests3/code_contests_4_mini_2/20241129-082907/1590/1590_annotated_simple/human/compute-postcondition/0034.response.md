Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (number of passengers) and `s` (the top floor), followed by `n` pairs of integers representing the floor number (`fi`) and arrival time (`ti`) for each passenger. It calculates the total time passed for all passengers to reach the ground floor, accounting for their arrival times and the order in which they are processed based on their floor numbers. The function outputs the total time taken, but does not handle input validation or potential edge cases explicitly, such as when `n` or `s` are outside the specified ranges. **
