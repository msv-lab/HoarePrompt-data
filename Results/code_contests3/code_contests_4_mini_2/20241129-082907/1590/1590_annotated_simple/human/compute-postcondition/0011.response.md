The loop iterates `n` times, where for each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `fi` and `ti` and appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. After the completion of all iterations of the loop, the list `p` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the input values for the respective passengers.

If `n` is between 1 and 100, the final state after all iterations will reflect that `p` contains exactly `n` tuples with the values filled in based on the inputs received during each iteration. The variable `i` will have a final value of `n - 1` since it starts at 0 and increments up to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` contains `n` tuples of the form `(fi, ti)`.**
