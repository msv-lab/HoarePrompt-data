`p` is being appended with a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti`, which were assigned from input. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
