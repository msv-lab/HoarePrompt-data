The variable `time_passed` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `p`, along with the new value of `time_passed`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, (0, 0) has been added to `p`, `time_passed` is 0**.
