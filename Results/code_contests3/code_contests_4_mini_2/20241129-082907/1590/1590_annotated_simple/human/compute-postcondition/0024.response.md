The expression `time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed` updates the value of `time_passed`. The new value of `time_passed` will be calculated based on the current value of `time_passed` and the value of `p[i][1]`. The previous values of `n` and `i` do not directly affect `time_passed`, but they determine which element from the list `p` is accessed. 

The output state will reflect the new value of `time_passed`, calculated as `p[i][1]` (where `i` is equal to `n`). 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n`; `s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`; `time_passed` is updated to `p[n][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `i` is `n`; `s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`; `time_passed` is updated to `p[n][1]`.**
