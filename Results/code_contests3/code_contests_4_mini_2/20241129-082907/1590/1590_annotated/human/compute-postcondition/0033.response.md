The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in the function signature. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function operates with the following implicit parameters: `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti`. 

- `n` is an integer that represents the number of passengers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `s` is an integer that represents the top floor number, constrained such that \(1 \leq s \leq 1000\).
- For each passenger \(i\), `fi` is an integer representing the floor number where the passenger arrives, constrained such that \(1 \leq fi \leq s\).
- For each passenger \(i\), `ti` is an integer representing the time of arrival in seconds, constrained such that \(1 \leq ti \leq 1000\).

The function processes these parameters, but the specific output is not described in the provided details.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing the number of passengers, the top floor number, the arrival floor number for each passenger, and the time of arrival for each passenger. The exact return value of the function is not specified.**
