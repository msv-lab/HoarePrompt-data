Postcondition: ***`time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (p[n][0] - p[n + 1][0])` and `s` is equal to `p[n + 1][0]`, `i` is set to `n + 1`, and `n` is increased for the loop to execute again. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (p[n + 1][1] - time_passed)`.***
