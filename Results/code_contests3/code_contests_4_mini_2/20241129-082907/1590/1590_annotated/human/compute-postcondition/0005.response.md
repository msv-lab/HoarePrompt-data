According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` can be incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1 to 1, and for it to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
