The code `p.append((0, 0))` adds a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The initial state does not provide specific details about the contents of `p`, aside from the fact that it is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The addition of the new tuple will modify the list `p`, but does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p` has been modified to include `(0, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, and now `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0).**
