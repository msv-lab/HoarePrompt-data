The value of `p` is updated to include a new tuple `(fi, ti)`, which is appended to the list `p`. The values of `n`, `i`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input, and `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input, and `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`**.
