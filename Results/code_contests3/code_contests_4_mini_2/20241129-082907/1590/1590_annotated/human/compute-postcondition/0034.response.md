Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the top floor number. It then collects the arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` for each passenger, sorts them by arrival floor in descending order, and calculates the total time taken to transport all passengers to their respective floors, including any waiting time if the elevator arrives before the passenger's scheduled time. Finally, it prints the total time taken. The function does not return any value. **
