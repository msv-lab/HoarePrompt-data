The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]` to its current value. The variable `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `i` is `n + 1`. Thus, we compute `s - p[i][0]` as `p[n][0] - p[n + 1][0]`. The variable `time_passed` is updated accordingly, but the previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (p[n][0] - p[n + 1][0])`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be increased for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (p[n][0] - p[n + 1][0])`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be increased for the loop to execute again.**
