The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, so we are effectively using the value from `p[n][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1] - time_passed`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1] - time_passed`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n`**
