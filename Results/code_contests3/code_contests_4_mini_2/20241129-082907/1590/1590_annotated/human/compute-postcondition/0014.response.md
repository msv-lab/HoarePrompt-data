The variable `time_passed` is initialized to 0, which means that it is now set to this specific integer value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
