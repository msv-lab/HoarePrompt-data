The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. Since `i` is `n` and `p[n + 1]` is defined, `s` will take on the value from the `p` array at index `n`. The values of `time_passed` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n`**
