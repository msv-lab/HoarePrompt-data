The line of code updates `time_passed` by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. Since the initial state indicates that `time_passed` is already less than `p[i][1]`, this means that the new value of `time_passed` will be increased to exactly `p[i][1]`. The value of `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, but since it is not directly affected by this line of code, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` was previously incremented by `s - p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` was previously incremented by `s - p[i][0]`.**
