`p` is updated to include a tuple consisting of the values of `fi` and `ti`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are integers received from input, while the current values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is now a list containing the tuple (fi, ti), where `fi` and `ti` are the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is now a list containing the tuple (fi, ti)**
