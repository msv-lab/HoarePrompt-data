According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 0 to `n`, inclusive, which means it will execute `n + 1` times. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` should initially be 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration since `range(n + 1)` starts from 0.
- The variable `p` is sorted and contains a tuple (0, 0) which does not affect the loop's execution, but it's important to know that `p` is available for use within the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `time_passed` is 0 at the start.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
