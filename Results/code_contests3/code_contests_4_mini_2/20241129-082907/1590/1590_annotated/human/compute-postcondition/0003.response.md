In this code snippet, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are expected to be two integers separated by a space. The function `map(int, ...)` converts the input values into integers. The variables `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `p` is an empty list, `fi` and `ti` are integers from input**.
