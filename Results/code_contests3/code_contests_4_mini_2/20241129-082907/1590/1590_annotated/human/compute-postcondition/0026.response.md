According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `0` to `n + 1`, meaning that `i` will take on values from `0` to `n`. If `i` is currently `n`, the next iteration will have `i` equal to `n + 1`, which exceeds the upper limit of the range. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased to allow `i` to become `n + 1`. However, since `i` is already at the maximum of the range, the loop will not be able to execute again without changing the value of `n`.

State: **`time_passed` is updated to `p[n][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be increased.**
