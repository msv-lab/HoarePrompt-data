According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given to be an integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), the loop will always execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment until it reaches `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `p` is an empty list, but its content does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `p` is an empty list**
