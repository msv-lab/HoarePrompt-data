The code assigns the values from input to the variables `fi` and `ti`, using `map` to convert the split input into integers. The previous values of the variables `fi` and `ti` are not defined, as they are being initialized from the input provided. The variable `n` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input**.
