The list `p` is being sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order (reverse=True). The previous state of `p` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(fi, ti)`. Since the exact values of the tuples in `p` are not specified, we can only describe how `p` changes.

After executing the sorting operation, `p` will be a reordered list, sorted by the first elements of the tuples in descending order. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order.**
