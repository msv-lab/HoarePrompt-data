According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
