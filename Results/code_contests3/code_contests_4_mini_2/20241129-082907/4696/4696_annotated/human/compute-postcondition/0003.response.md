The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was assigned the integer value of `b`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, after executing the code, `i` becomes `b - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from `raw_input().split(); `i` is now `b - 1`.**
