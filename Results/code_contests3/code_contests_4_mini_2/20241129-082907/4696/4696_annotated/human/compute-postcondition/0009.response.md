To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 50 \).
- `k` is `1`.
- `f` is `factorial(n - 1)`.
- `d` is calculated as `i // f`, but since `i` is undefined, the value of `d` cannot be determined.
- `p` is not specified, which means we do not know its content or structure.

Now, analyzing the line of code:

```python
p.remove(p[d])
```

This line attempts to remove an element from the list `p` at the index `d`. However, since `d` cannot be calculated due to the undefined `i`, the operation cannot be completed. 

The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged states of the defined variables and mention the issue with `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is undefined; `i` is undefined; `p` is not specified; cannot perform `p.remove(p[d])` due to undefined `d`.**
