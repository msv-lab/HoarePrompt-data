The variable `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, which is taken from the values assigned to `a` and `b` from `raw_input().split()`. However, the values of `b` and `a` are not specified in the initial state. Since `n` is defined but not directly affecting `i`, we cannot infer the specific value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment and the nature of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from `raw_input().split(); `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
