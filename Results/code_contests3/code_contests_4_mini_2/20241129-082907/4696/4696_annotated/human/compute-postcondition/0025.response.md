Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length `n`). It calculates and prints the `i`-th permutation of the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in lexicographical order. The function does not return any value. **
