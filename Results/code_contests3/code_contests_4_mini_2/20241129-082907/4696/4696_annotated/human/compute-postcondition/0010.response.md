The variable `i` is assigned the value of `i % f`. Here, `i` is undefined, and `f` is `factorial(n - 1)`, which is a positive integer. Since `i` is undefined, the operation `i % f` cannot be performed, leaving `i` still undefined. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is undefined; `i` is undefined; `p` is not specified; cannot perform `p.remove(p[d])` due to undefined `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is undefined; `i` is undefined; `p` is not specified; cannot perform `p.remove(p[d])` due to undefined `d`.**
