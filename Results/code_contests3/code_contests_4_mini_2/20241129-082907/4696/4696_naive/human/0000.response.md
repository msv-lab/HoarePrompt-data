To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the code step by step and identify if there are any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements.

The problem requires finding the lexicographically m-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n that yields the maximum possible value of the function f(p).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program reads two integers from input: `n` and `m`.
2. It converts `m` to a zero-based index by subtracting 1.
3. It initializes a list `p` with numbers from 1 to n.
4. It iterates through each position `k` from 1 to n to determine the correct permutation:
   - It calculates `f` as the factorial of `(n-k)`.
   - It computes `d` as the index of the next number to select from `p` using integer division.
   - It prints the selected number and removes it from the list `p`.
   - It updates the index `i` for the next iteration.

### Potential Issue:
- The code uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`).
- The algorithm logic seems to correctly handle the calculation of the lexicographically m-th permutation based on factorial indices.
- However, we need to ensure that it correctly handles all cases, especially edge cases where `n` is at its boundary limits (1 and 50).

#### Testing Edge Cases:
1. For `n = 1`, `m = 1`: The only permutation is `[1]`, so it should correctly output `1`.
2. For `n = 8` (the maximum in subproblem B1) and `m = 40320`: The expected output should be the last permutation `[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, and the program should correctly compute this.

### Conclusion:
There is a flaw in the input handling (using `raw_input()` instead of `input()`), which will result in a runtime error in Python 3. This indicates that the program cannot produce correct results in all scenarios.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
