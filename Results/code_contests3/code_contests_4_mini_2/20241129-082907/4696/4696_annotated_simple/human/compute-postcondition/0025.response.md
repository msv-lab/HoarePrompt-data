The function `func` accepts no parameters and processes input via standard input. It expects two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where `n` is constrained between 1 and 50. The variable `m` is also constrained to be a positive integer, which must be less than or equal to the number of permutations of length `n` with maximum possible value of `f(p)`. 

The function calculates the `m`-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` using a sequence of factorial calculations to determine the appropriate indices for selection. It prints each number of the resulting permutation as it is determined.

However, the function does not explicitly handle out-of-bounds cases, such as when `m` exceeds the total number of permutations, which could lead to incorrect behavior or unhandled exceptions. Additionally, the function entirely relies on standard input, which may limit its usability in contexts where direct function calls with arguments are expected.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers from input, computes the m-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, and prints the permutation. It does not handle cases where m exceeds the number of possible permutations of n. **
