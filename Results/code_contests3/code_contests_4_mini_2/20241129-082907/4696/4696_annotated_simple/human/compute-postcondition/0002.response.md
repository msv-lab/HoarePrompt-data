`i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is the second part of input. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first part of input; `b` is the second part of input; `n` is the integer value of `a`; `i` is the integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`a` is the first part of input; `b` is the second part of input; `n` is the integer value of `a`; `i` is the integer value of `b`**
