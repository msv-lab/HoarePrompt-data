The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is known to be the integer value of `b`, but since `b` is unspecified, we can only describe the operation rather than assign a specific value. The states of `a`, `n`, and `i` are affected, with `i` being decreased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first part of input; `b` is the second part of input; `n` is the integer value of `a`; `i` is the integer value of `b - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is the first part of input; `b` is the second part of input; `n` is the integer value of `a`; `i` is the integer value of `b - 1**
