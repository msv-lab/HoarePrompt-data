The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. It operates based on predefined constraints where `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `m` is a positive integer defined within the limits of the number of permutations of length `n` that yield the maximum value of `f(p)`. 

The output of the function is based on these internal constraints and conditions. As the specific return values or operations are not detailed in the provided information, we cannot specify the exact output.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates based on internal constraints for positive integers n and m, returning results based on permutations and their properties.**
