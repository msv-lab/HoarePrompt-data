The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, this results in `f` being assigned the value of `factorial(n - 3)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n - 3` will be a non-negative integer, meaning `f` will be a defined, non-negative integer value representing the factorial of that integer. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is calculated as `i // factorial(n - 2)`, the element at index `d` has been removed from `p`, and `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 2)`.

Output State: **`a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is calculated as `i // factorial(n - 2)`, the element at index `d` has been removed from `p`, and `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 2)`.**
