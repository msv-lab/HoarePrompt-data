The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 2, this means `f` will be assigned the value of `factorial(n - 2)`. The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `k`, `d`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is calculated as `i // factorial(n - 1)`, `p[d]` is printed, and the element `p[d]` is removed from the list `p`; `i` is now `i % factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is the first part of input, `b` is the second part of input, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is calculated as `i // factorial(n - 1)`, `p[d]` is printed, and the element `p[d]` is removed from the list `p`; `i` is now `i % factorial(n - 1)`.**
