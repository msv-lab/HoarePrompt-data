The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i % f`. Since `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 1)` and `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer as well. However, the variable `i` is undefined, which leads to an error when trying to execute `i = i % f`. Therefore, the output state indicates that an error occurs due to the undefined variable `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial(n - 1), error occurs due to undefined variable `i` when executing `i = i % f`.**
