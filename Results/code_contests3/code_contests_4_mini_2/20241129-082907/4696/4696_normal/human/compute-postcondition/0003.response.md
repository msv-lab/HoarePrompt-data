The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is known to be the integer value of `b`, but since `b` is a string input from the user, we cannot determine its exact integer value without that input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `i` has been decreased by 1 but does not specify the exact value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from user input, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `a` is a string from user input, `b` is a string from user input; `i` is decreased by 1.**
