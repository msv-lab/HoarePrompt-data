The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p). Based on these constraints, the function returns a result related to the permutations of length n and the specified value of m. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on the permutations of length n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and m is a positive integer within the limits of the permutations count.**
