`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, so `n - 1` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `f` will hold the value of the factorial of a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
