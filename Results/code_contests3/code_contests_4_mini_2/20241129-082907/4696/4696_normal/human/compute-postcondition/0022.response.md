Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `i` is undefined, `d` cannot be computed, and an error occurs when trying to access `p[d]`, therefore the operation `p.remove(p[d])` cannot be executed; `i` remains undefined since the operation `i = i % f` cannot be performed with an undefined `i`.**
