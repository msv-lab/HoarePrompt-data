The variable `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`. The values entered must be two strings separated by whitespace, but since the specific input is not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` and `b` are strings from user input.**
