The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, this means `f` will be calculated as `factorial(n - 3)`. Since `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `n - 3` will be non-negative. Therefore, `f` will be the factorial of a non-negative integer. The states of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3)**
