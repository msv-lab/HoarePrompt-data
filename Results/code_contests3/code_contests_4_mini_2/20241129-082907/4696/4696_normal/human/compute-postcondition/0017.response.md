According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, so it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
