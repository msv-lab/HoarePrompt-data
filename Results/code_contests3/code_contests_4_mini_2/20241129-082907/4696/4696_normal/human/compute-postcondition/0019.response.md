The variable `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, where `//` represents integer division. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so the output state cannot specify its value. The variable `f` is defined as factorial(n - 3), which is a calculated value based on `n`. Therefore, since `i` is undefined, we can't compute `d`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `f` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is undefined, so `d` cannot be computed.**
