The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is a string from user input. Since `b` is a string, `int(b)` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer from user input, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `a` is a string from user input, `b` is a string from user input; `i` is the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from user input, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `a` is a string from user input, `b` is a string from user input; `i` is the integer value of `b`.**
