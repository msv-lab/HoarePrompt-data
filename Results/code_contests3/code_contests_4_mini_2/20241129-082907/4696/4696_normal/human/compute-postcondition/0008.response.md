The code attempts to print the value of `p` at index `d`. However, the value of `d` is dependent on the undefined variable `i`, which means that the value of `d` cannot be evaluated. The variable `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, and `f` is factorial(n - 1), but these do not affect the result of the print statement. Since `d` is not defined, we cannot access `p[d]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial(n - 1), and `d` is dependent on an undefined variable `i`, leading to an error in accessing `p[d]`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial(n - 1), and `d` is dependent on an undefined variable `i`, leading to an error in accessing `p[d]**.
