According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `n`. Since `k` is currently 1 and the loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n`, it can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
