`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 2, the expression simplifies to `factorial(n - 2)`. Since `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `n - 2` will be a non-negative integer (0 or greater). Therefore, `f` will hold the factorial of a non-negative integer, which is defined. The other variable states are unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2)**
