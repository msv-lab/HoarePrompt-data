The code attempts to print the value of `p` at index `d`. However, since `i` is undefined, `d` cannot be computed. Therefore, there is an issue with the execution due to the undefined variable. The values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are not affected by this operation, and thus they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `i` is undefined, `d` cannot be computed, and an error occurs when trying to access `p[d]`.**
