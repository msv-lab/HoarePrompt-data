Given the provided loop and its behavior, we can analyze the state of the variables after all iterations have completed.

1. The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `k = n`.
2. In each iteration, it calculates `f` as `factorial(n - k)`, and `d` as the integer division of `i` by `f`.
3. It prints the `d`-th element from the list `p` and then removes this element from `p`.
4. The variable `i` is updated to `i % f`.

After the loop has completed all iterations:

- `n` remains a positive integer as it is not modified in the loop.
- `k` will be equal to `n + 1` since after the last iteration, `k` increments one last time to exit the loop.
- The variable `f` will not have a final value because it is recalculated in each iteration, and after the last iteration, it would be `factorial(n - n)`, which is `factorial(0)` = 1.
- The final value of `i` will depend on the initial value and how it was modified in the loop, but the exact value cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `i`.
- The list `p` will be empty after all iterations since each element is removed during the iterations.

Considering these points, the final output state of the program after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is `n + 1`, `f` is 1, `i` is the final result of the last modification in the loop, `p` is an empty list.**
