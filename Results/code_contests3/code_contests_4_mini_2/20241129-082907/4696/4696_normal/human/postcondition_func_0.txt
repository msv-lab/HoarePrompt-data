The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers from input, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 50) and `i` (a positive integer representing the index of a permutation). It then calculates and prints the `i`-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` based on the factorial number system. The function does not return a value; it directly prints the result. There is no handling for invalid input cases, such as if `i` exceeds the total number of permutations of `n` (which is `n!`).
