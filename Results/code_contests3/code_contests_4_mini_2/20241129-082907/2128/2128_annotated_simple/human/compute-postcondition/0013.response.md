According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute while `l` is within the range from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2 and `k` is `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2. This means that `k` is at least 1 (since if `n` is 2, `k` is 1). 

For the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need `l` to be less than or equal to `k`, which is `n - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be at least 4 (since `l` is going to be 3). 

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 3, and `ans` has increased by `arr[3]**
