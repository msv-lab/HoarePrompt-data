According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The value of `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration up to `t - 1`. Before the loop starts, `t` is dynamically assigned based on user input, so its value can vary. 

For the loop to be executed at least one time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0, representing the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
