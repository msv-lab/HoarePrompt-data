`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`. The initial states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, we can state that `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, and `ans` has increased by `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, and `ans` has increased by `arr[2]**.
