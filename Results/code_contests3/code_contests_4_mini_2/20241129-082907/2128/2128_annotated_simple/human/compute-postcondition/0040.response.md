`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The exact value of `arr[l]` depends on the index `l`, which is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will increase by an integer value from the list `arr`. The output states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state can be summarized as follows: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are such that `k` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, where `arr[l]` is an integer from the list.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are such that `k` is at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`**
