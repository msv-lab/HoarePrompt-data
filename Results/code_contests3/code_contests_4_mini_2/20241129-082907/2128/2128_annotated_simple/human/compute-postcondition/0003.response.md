The variable `arr` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. This means `arr` will hold a list of integers, where the integers are provided as input from the standard input. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
