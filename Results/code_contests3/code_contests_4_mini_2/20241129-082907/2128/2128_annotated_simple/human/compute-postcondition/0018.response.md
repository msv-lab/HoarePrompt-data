The code assigns values to `n` and `k` from the input, using `map` to convert the string input into integers. The values of `n` and `k` will be determined by the input provided through `sys.stdin.readline()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers**
