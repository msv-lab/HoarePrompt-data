According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
