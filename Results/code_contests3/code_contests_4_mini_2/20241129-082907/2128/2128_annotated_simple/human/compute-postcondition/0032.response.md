According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 0, which implies that for the loop to execute a second time, `t` must be at least 2. In this case, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be at least 2**
