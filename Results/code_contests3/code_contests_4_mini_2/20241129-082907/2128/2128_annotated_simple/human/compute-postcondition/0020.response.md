The list `arr` is sorted in descending order due to the `sorted(arr, reverse=True)` function. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers from input. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state can be described as follows: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
