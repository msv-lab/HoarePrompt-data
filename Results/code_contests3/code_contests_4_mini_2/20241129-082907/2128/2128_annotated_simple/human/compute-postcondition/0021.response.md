`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr` in descending order. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the state of `arr` is also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`**.
