The variable `arr` is assigned a list created by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.readline()`, converting each split string into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, but their specific values are not provided. However, the impact of this code means that `arr` will contain integers based on the input read. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, and `arr` is a list of integers created from that input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers created from that input.**
