The variable `arr` is sorted in descending order (reverse=True). The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but they are a list of integers created from the input. Therefore, after execution, `arr` will contain the same integers sorted from highest to lowest. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
