The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order (reverse=True). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. However, the order of the elements in `arr` changes based on its initial values. Since the specific elements of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the effect of the operation in general terms.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
