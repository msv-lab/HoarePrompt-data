`ans` is assigned the value `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`**
