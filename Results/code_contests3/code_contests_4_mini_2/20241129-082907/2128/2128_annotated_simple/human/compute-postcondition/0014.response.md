`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[3]`. The variable `l` is 3, thus `arr[l]` refers to `arr[3]`. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it will now be incremented by `arr[3]`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 3, and `ans` has increased by `arr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 3, and `ans` has increased by `arr[3]**
