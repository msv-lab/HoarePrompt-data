`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. Since `l` is 1, the value being added to `ans` corresponds to `arr[1]`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is increased by `arr[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is increased by `arr[1]**.
