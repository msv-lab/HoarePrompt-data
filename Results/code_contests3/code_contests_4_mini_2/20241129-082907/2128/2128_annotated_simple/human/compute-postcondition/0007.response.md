The variable `k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Given that `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, this means that the value of `n` must be 1 or greater, resulting in `k` being 0 or greater. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.**
