According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3 because `l` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be 3, and `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, `l` is 3**
