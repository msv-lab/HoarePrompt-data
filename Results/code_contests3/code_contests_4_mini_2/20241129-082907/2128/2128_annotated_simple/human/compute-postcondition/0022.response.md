The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is an input integer, which means `k` will be one less than that input value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr**
