The value of `k` is assigned the result of `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is from the input, but it is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` holds. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr; `k` is `n - 1`.**
