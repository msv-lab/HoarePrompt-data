Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of the largest integer in the list and the next `k` largest integers (or `n-1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`) for each test case and prints the result. If `k` is adjusted to `n-1`, it ensures that the code does not add more elements than available in the list. **
