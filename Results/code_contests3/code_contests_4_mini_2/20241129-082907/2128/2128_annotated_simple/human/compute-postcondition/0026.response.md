According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` in relation to `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is currently 1, and `k` is at least 1, which means the loop can run again. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, since `k` is at least 2, the loop can continue as long as it remains greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2, `l` is 2.**
