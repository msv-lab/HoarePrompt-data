In this case, `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 3, we are adding the value of `arr[3]` to `ans`. Since `arr` is a list of integers and is sorted in descending order, the value of `arr[3]` is defined, but we do not have its specific value since we only know that `k` is at least 3. 

Since `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `n` is such that `k` is at least 3, the impact on the state is that `ans` will now have a new value which is its previous value plus `arr[3]`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is such that `k` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is such that `k` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.**
