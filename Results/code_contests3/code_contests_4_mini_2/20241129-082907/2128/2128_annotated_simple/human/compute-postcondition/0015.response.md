To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the given information and the loop's behavior.

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `l = 1` to `l = k`, where `k = n - 1`. This means the loop will execute `k` times, which is equivalent to `n - 1` times.

2. **Variable Changes**: In each iteration of the loop, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `ans` will have increased by the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` (which is `arr[n - 1]`).

3. **Conditions**: 
   - If `n >= 2`, then `k` will be at least `1`, meaning the loop will execute at least once.
   - If `n < 2`, then `k` would be `-1`, and the loop would not execute at all.

4. **Final State**:
   - If `n >= 2`, `ans` will be equal to its initial value plus the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `l` will be `k = n - 1`.
   - If `n < 2`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the loop does not execute.

Considering these points, we can summarize the final state:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is `k`, and `ans` is increased by the sum of elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`. If `n` is less than 2, `ans` remains unchanged.**
