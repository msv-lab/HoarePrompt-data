`ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 3, `arr[l]` corresponds to the fourth element of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the value of `arr[3]` is defined. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.**
