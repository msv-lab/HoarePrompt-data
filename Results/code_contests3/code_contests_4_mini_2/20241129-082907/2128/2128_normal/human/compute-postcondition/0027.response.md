The code increments `ans` by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the value of `arr[2]` will be the third largest integer in the list. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact new value. However, we can state that `ans` has been increased by `arr[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `l` is 2, `ans` is incremented by `arr[2]**
