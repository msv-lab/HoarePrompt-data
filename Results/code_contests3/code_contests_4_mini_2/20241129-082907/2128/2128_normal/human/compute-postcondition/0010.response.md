`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + arr[l]`. The value of `ans` is the first element of `arr`, and since `l` is 1, it refers to the second element of `arr`. Therefore, `ans` will now be the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`, and `l` is 1.
