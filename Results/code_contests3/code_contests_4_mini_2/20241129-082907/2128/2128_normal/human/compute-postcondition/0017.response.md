According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`, which means `t` must be greater than 0. After the loop executes, `i` is incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
