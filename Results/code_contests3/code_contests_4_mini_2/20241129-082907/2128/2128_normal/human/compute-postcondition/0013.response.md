According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop starts at `l = 1` and will continue executing as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

After the last iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[2]`, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
