The code `ans += arr[l]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is stated to be 2 for the loop to execute a second time, the value of `arr[2]` will be added to `ans`. The previous state of `ans` is not explicitly defined, but it has been updated previously. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]**
