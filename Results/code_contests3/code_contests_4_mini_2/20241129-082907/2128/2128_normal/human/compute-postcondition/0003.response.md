The variable `arr` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input read from the standard input, which is split into separate values. The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, as they are not directly involved in the assignment to `arr`. The input for `arr` comes from the user and will determine its contents.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
