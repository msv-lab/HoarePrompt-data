`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. However, we know that `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` holds. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
