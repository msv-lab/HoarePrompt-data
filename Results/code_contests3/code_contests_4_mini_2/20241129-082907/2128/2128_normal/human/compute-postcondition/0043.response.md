According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute for values of `l` from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. Since the loop has not executed any iterations yet, the current value of `l` would be 1 during the first iteration.

For the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `l` needs to be incremented. After the first iteration, `l` would become 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute for `l` equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2], for the loop to execute a second time l must be 2 and k must be at least 2**
