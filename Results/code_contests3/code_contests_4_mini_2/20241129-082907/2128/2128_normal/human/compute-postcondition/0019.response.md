The code reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the previous values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are also unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects these assignments.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input line read, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
