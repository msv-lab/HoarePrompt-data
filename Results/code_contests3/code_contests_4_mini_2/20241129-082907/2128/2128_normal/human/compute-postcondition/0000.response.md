The variable `t` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line of input, and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected by this line of code, so the output state reflects the assignment of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from standard input**
