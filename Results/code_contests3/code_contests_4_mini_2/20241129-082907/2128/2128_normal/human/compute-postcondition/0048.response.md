The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it processes input data that is implicitly provided (likely through standard input) according to the specified constraints. The function operates based on `t` test cases, where for each test case it expects three values: `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. 

Based on the output requirements, the function returns results that are dependent on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. However, the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on provided integers and a list, returning results derived from those inputs, but it does not accept parameters directly.**
