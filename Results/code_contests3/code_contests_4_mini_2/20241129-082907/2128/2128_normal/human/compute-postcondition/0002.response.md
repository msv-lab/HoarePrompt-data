`n` and `k` are assigned values from a single line input, split by space, and converted to integers using `map`. The previous values of `t` and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, and `k` is an integer from input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, and `k` is an integer from input**.
