`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`**
