The code reads a line from standard input, splits it by spaces, and assigns the two resulting values to `n` and `k` after converting them to integers. Since `t` is an integer input greater than 1, and the loop condition requires `t` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, the values of `n` and `k` will be determined by the input line read. The previous values of `i` and `t` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer input greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input line read.**
