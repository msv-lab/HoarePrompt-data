The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order (reverse=True). The initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. However, the order of elements in `arr` will be modified based on its previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
