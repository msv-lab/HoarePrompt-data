The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.**
