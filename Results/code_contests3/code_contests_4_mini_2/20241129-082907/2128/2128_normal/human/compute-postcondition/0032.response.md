According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `t` is an integer greater than 1, the loop can execute one more time as long as `i` is less than `t`. 

After the last iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, it must be true that `i` (which will be 2) is still less than `t`. Given that `t` is at least 2, this condition will hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 2**
