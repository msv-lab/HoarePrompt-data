The variable `arr` is assigned the value of its elements sorted in descending order, but the initial elements of `arr` are not specified. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this sorting operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
