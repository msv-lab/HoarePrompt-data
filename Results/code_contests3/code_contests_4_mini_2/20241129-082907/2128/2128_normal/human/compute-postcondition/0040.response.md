The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `ans` is currently the first element of `arr`, and since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` refers to an element in the array at index `l`. The specific value of `arr[l]` is unknown, but it is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the first element of `arr`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]**.
