Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list in descending order and computes the sum of the largest integer and the next `k` largest integers (up to `k` elements, ensuring that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it only sums up to `n - 1`). The resulting sum is printed for each test case. The function does not accept parameters directly; it reads input from standard input. **
