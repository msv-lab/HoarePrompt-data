`ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. The value of `arr[l]` is determined by the index `l`, which is 1. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `arr[1]` is the second largest element in the list. The previous value of `ans` is not given, but it will increase by the value of `arr[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `l` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `l` is 1, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[1]**
