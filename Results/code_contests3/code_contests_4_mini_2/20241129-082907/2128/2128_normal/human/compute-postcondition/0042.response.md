The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it, where `l` is 2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[2]` will be the third largest element in the array. The previous value of `ans` is updated accordingly. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]**
