The variable `arr` is assigned a list of integers that are obtained by reading a line of input, splitting it by spaces, and mapping those split values to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are used to determine how many integers will be read from input, but their specific values are not given, so we consider them as integers. The variable `t` is an integer greater than 1, and `i` is 2, but they do not affect the assignment of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers, and `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
