The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is previously assigned based on the input line read. Since `t` is an integer input greater than 1, and given that `n` can take on a range of values based on that input, `k` will be equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value based on input, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`.**
