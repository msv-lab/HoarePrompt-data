The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))`, which reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list from these integers. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` now holds a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged; `arr` is a list of integers from input**
