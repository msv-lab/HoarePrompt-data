The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 1, this means `ans` is increased by the second largest element in `arr` (because `arr` is sorted in reverse order). The previous value of `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, and `arr[l]` is the second largest. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 1, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`, `i` is `t`, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 1, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`, `i` is `t`, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
