According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2 (which means `n` must be at least 3).

State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
