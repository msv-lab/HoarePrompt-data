According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is `k`, so for the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented to `k + 1`. 

However, since `l` can only take values from 1 up to `k`, and it cannot be less than 1 or greater than `k`, the loop will not execute again after `l` reaches `k`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 1. 

State: **`n`, `k`, `a` are unchanged; `ans` is incremented by `arr[k]` where `l` is `k + 1` and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
