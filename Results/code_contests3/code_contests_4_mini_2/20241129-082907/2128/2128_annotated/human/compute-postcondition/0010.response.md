Since `ans` is being incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, and given that `l` is 1, `ans` will now hold the value `ans + arr[1]`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, and the previous value of `ans` will determine the final value after this operation. However, the initial state does not specify the actual values in `arr` or `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the increment operation without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a` are unchanged; `ans` is incremented by `arr[1]`**
