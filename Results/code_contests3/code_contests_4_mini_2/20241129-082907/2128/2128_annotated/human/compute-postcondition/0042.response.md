The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The previous state mentions that `ans` is already updated with the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`. The variable `l` is 2, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[2]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and the arrangement of `arr` are not directly changed by this line of code. Assuming `arr` has enough elements (since `n` must be at least 3 for the loop condition), `arr[2]` can be accessed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, and `ans` has now increased by the value of `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is now increased by `arr[2]`.**
