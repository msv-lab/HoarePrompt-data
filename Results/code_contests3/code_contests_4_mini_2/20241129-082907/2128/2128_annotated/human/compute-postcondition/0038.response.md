Postcondition: ***`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is `k`, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is `t`, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `arr` continues to be sorted in reverse order.***
