The value of `k` is assigned the result of `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is the input value, so `k` will be `n - 1`. The other variables `l`, `ans`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is `k`, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is `k`, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
