According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is `n - 1`, meaning that `i` is currently at the last value it can take before the loop concludes. 

In this case, `i` would be equal to the current iteration count, which is `t - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `t`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `i`, which means that `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, which is always true. Thus, we need to set `i` to `t`.

State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is `k`, `ans` is increased by the sum of elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, `i` is `t`, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than `t - 1`**
