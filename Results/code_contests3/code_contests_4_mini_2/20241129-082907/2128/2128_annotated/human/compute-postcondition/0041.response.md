According to the code, the loop executes as long as the variable `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `k` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `l` will become 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2 (which is `n - 1 >= 2` or equivalently `n >= 3`).

State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]`, `i` is `t`, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
