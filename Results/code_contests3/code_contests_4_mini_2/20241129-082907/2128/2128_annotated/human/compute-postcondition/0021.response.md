The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input; `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from input; `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.**
