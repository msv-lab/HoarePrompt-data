According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged. Given that `ans` has been printed and the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`. If `t` is greater than `i`, the loop can run again.

State: **`n`, `k`, `a` are unchanged, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than `i + 1`**
