The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value, `k` is the input value minus 1, `l` is `k`, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is the input value minus 1, `l` is `k`, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
