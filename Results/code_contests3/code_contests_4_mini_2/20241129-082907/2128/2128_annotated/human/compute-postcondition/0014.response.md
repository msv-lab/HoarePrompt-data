The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The variable `l` is defined as `k + 1`, so `arr[l]` refers to the element in the `arr` array at index `k + 1`. Since `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will always be at least 2. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `a` are unchanged; `ans` is incremented by `arr[k + 1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `a` are unchanged; `ans` is incremented by `arr[k + 1]**
