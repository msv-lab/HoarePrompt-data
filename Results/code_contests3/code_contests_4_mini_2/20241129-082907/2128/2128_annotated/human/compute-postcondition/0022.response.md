`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is not specified, so `k` will be `n - 1` which can vary based on the input for `n`. The other variables `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is input value; `k` is `n - 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is input value; `k` is `n - 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr**.
