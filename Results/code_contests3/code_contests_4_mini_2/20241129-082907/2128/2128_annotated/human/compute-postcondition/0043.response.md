According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `l`, which is starting from 1 and going up to `k + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. After the current iteration, `l` will be 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3, which means `n` must be at least 4 (`k` is `n - 1`).

State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 3, `ans` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `arr[1]` increased by `arr[2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
