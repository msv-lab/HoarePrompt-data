`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged; `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged; `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `arr`.**
