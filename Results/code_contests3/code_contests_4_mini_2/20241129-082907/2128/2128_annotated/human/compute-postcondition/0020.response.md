The variable `arr` is sorted in descending order (reverse=True). The initial values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, and the sorting operation rearranges the elements of `arr` without changing its reference. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input; `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from input; `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
