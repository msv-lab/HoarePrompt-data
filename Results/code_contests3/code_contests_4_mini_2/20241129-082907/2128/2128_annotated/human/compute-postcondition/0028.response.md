According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be increased by 1, making it 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `k` is `n - 1`).

State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
