The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but after execution, `arr` will be a sorted list in reverse order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**
