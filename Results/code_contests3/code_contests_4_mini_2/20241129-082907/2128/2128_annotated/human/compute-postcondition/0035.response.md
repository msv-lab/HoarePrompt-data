The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation, and `i` remains `t`. The initial state of the list `arr` will change to its sorted version, but the specific output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables as well as the fact that the list has been sorted.

Output State: **`n` is the input value, `k` is the input value minus 1, `l` is `k`, `ans` remains increased by the sum of elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, `i` is `t`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
