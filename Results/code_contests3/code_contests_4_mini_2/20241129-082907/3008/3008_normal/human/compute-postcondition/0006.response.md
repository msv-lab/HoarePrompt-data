The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). However, the output and specific return values for different conditions of `n` are not provided. Therefore, without additional information, we cannot ascertain the exact functionality related to the return values based on the input parameter `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^18]. The specific return value based on n is not specified.**
