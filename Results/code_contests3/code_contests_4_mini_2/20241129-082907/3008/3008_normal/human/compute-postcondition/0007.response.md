The function `func` accepts input `n` as a string representing a non-negative integer. It checks the last digit of `n` to determine if it is not zero; if the last digit is not zero, it sets `s` to 1. The function then calculates and prints the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, there is a significant issue: since `n` is taken as a string, dividing a string by an integer will raise a `TypeError` in Python, leading to an unhandled exception. The function does not return any value explicitly, as it only prints the result.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input representing a non-negative integer, checks if the last digit is not zero, and attempts to print an expression based on `n`; however, it will raise a `TypeError` during execution due to incorrect handling of string input in the arithmetic operation. **
