The function accepts no parameters, reads a non-negative integer `n` from input as a string, calculates whether the last digit of `n` is non-zero, and prints the result of `2 * (n / 10) + s`, where `s` is 1 if the last digit is non-zero and 0 if it is zero. However, since `n` is treated as a string, this will result in a TypeError during the division operation. The function does not handle this error, leading to a failure in execution.
