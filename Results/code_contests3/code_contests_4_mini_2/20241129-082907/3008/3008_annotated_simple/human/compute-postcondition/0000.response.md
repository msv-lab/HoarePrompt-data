`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes input as a string. Since `n` was originally a non-negative integer, it will now hold a string representation of a value within the given range. The value of `n` changes, but no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
