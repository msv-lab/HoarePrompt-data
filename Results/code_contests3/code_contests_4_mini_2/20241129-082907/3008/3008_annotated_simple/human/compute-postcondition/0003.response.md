The variable `s` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `s` is `0`, so after execution, `s` becomes `1`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `s` is 1**
