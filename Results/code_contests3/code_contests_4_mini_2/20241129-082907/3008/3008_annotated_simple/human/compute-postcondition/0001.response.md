The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0**
