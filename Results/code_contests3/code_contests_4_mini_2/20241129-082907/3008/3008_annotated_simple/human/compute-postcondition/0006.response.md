The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). However, since `n` is not directly passed to the function as an argument, the function's output or behavior is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, based on the information given, the functionality of the function cannot be determined. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its output is not defined based on the provided information.**
