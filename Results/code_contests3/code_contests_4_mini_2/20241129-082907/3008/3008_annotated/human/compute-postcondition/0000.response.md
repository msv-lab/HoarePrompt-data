The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The constraints indicate that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^18, but since `input()` returns a string, the final type of `n` after this assignment remains a string. The output state reflects that `n` is now a string containing the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing user input**
