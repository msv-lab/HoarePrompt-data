The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer constrained such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. However, the output behavior of the function is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be described further without additional details on the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n which is a non-negative integer in the range [0, 10^18]. The return value is not specified.**
