Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` (via user input), checks if the last digit of `n` is not zero, and sets a variable `s` to 1 if it isn't. It then prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, the function does not return a value, and since `n` is treated as a string, this may lead to issues when performing arithmetic operations; it should be converted to an integer first. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the output will just be `0`. The function lacks proper error handling for input conversion and assumes that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer string.**
