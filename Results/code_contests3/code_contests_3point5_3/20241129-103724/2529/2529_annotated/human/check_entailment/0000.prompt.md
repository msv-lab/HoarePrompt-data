You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Rebel fleet is on the run. It consists of m ships currently gathered around a single planet. Just a few seconds ago, the vastly more powerful Empire fleet has appeared in the same solar system, and the Rebels will need to escape into hyperspace. In order to spread the fleet, the captain of each ship has independently come up with the coordinate to which that ship will jump. In the obsolete navigation system used by the Rebels, this coordinate is given as the value of an arithmetic expression of the form <image>.

To plan the future of the resistance movement, Princess Heidi needs to know, for each ship, how many ships are going to end up at the same coordinate after the jump. You are her only hope!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200 000) – the number of ships. The next m lines describe one jump coordinate each, given as an arithmetic expression. An expression has the form (a+b)/c. Namely, it consists of: an opening parenthesis (, a positive integer a of up to two decimal digits, a plus sign +, a positive integer b of up to two decimal digits, a closing parenthesis ), a slash /, and a positive integer c of up to two decimal digits.

Output

Print a single line consisting of m space-separated integers. The i-th integer should be equal to the number of ships whose coordinate is equal to that of the i-th ship (including the i-th ship itself).

Example

Input

4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7


Output

1 2 2 1 

Note

In the sample testcase, the second and the third ship will both end up at the coordinate 3.

Note that this problem has only two versions – easy and hard.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a positive integer and each jump coordinate expression follows the format (a+b)/c where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits.**
def func():
    m = int(input())
    test_list = []
    for i in range(m):
        e = float(input())
        
        test_list.append(e)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `e` is an input floating-point number, `test_list` contains `m` elements, each element being an input floating-point number
    my_list = []
    for i in test_list:
        my_list.append(test_list.count(i))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is the last element in `test_list`, `e` is the same as the last element in `test_list`, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`
    print(' '.join(map(str, my_list)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a positive integer `m` from the input, then reads `m` floating-point numbers into a list `test_list`. After that, it counts the occurrences of each element in `test_list` and prints the counts as space-separated values. The function does not accept any parameters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
