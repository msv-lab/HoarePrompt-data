Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not match the problem description. The problem description states that the jump coordinates are given in the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. However, the program reads floating-point numbers instead of arithmetic expressions in the specified format. This means that the program does not correctly process the input data according to the problem description.
