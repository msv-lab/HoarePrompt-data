According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, m is assigned the value of an integer input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
