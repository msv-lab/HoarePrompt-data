Example Answer:
`e` is appended to the `test_list` list. The initial state does not mention the contents of `test_list`, so after execution, the `test_list` will contain `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is an input floating-point number, `test_list` contains `e`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is an input floating-point number, `test_list` contains `e`**
