According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `m` being greater than 0 ensures that the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `i` needs to be the first element in `test_list`, `e` is the same as the first element in `test_list`, and `my_list` remains empty.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is the first element in `test_list`, `e` is the same as the first element in `test_list`, `my_list` is an empty list**
