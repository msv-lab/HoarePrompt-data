Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The input is supposed to be arithmetic expressions in the form of (a+b)/c, but the program is attempting to read float values instead of strings representing the expressions. This will lead to incorrect output as the program will not be able to correctly parse the expressions. 

Example:
Input
```
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2 2 1
```

Actual Output (for the given program):
```
1 1 1 1
```
