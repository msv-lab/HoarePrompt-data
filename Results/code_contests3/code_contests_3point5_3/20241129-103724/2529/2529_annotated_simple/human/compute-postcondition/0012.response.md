Example Answer:
`my_list` is assigned an empty list, and no other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, test_list is a list containing the float values of all inputs, i is equal to m - 1, e is assigned the float value of the input, my_list is an empty list.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, test_list is a list containing the float values of all inputs, i is equal to m - 1, e is assigned the float value of the input, my_list is an empty list**
