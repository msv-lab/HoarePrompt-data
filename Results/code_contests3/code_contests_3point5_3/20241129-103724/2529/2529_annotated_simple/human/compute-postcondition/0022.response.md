Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `m` representing the number of ships. It then reads `m` float values as input and stores them in a list `test_list`. Next, it creates a new list `my_list` where each element represents the count of occurrences of the corresponding element in `test_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each unique element in `test_list` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.**
