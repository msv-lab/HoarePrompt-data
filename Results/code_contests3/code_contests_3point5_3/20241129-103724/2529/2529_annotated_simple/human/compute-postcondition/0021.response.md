The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for handling a scenario where m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, and each jump coordinate is given as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function does not return any specific value, but it is expected to process the given information related to the number of ships and the jump coordinates.
