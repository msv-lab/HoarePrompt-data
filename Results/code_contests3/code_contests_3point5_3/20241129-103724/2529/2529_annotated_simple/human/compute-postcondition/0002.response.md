According to the code, the loop will execute as long as m is greater than 0. Since test_list is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes the first time, m needs to be greater than 0 and i is 0.
State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, test_list is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
