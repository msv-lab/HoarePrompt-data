Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

1. The program reads the input as float values, but according to the problem description, the input should be read as arithmetic expressions in the form of strings.
2. The program counts the frequency of each float value in the input list, but it should count the number of ships ending up at the same coordinate after the jump.
3. The program does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions to calculate the final coordinate as required by the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
