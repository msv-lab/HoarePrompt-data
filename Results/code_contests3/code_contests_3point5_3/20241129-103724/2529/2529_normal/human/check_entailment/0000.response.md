Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The description states that the jump coordinates are given in the form (a+b)/c, which means the input values should be strings representing arithmetic expressions. However, the code reads float values instead of strings, which will lead to incorrect results when trying to parse the coordinates. The code should be modified to read strings and then evaluate the arithmetic expressions to determine the coordinates accurately.
