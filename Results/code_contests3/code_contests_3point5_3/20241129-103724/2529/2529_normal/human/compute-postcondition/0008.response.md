According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`, as well as the contents of `test_list`. If `i` is less than `m` and there is a new float `e` in `test_list` for the loop to iterate over, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and `test_list` contains the new float `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2 and there should be another new float `e` in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `test_list` contains at least one more new float `e` for the loop to iterate over**
