According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_list`. Since `m` is a positive integer, it means that `test_list` is not empty and the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `my_list` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_list` should contain at least one float, and `i` should be the first float in `test_list`.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains at least one float, `i` is the first float in `test_list`, `my_list` is an empty list**
