Example Answer: 
`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a float. The loop will execute again since a new float `e` has been appended to `test_list`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, a new float `e` has been appended to `test_list` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, a new float `e` has been appended to `test_list` for the loop to execute again**
