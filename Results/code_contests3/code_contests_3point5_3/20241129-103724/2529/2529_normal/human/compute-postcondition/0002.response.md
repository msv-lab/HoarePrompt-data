According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `m` is a positive integer. Since `test_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `m` is a positive integer and `i` is 0.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
