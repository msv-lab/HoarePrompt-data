Functionality: **The function reads in a positive integer m representing the number of ships, and then reads m float values into a list test_list. It then creates another list my_list that stores the count of each float in test_list. Finally, it prints the counts of each float in my_list separated by spaces. The function does not calculate or return the average jump coordinate as indicated in the comment.**
