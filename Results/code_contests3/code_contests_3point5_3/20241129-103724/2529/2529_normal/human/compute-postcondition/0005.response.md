According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `e` is an input float, `e` has been appended to `test_list`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `m` remains the same, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and a new float `e` must be appended to `test_list`.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, a new float `e` has been appended to `test_list` for the loop to execute again**
