Example Answer:
A new float `e` is appended to the `test_list` for the loop to execute again. The value of `m` remains a positive integer, `i` remains 1, and the `test_list` now contains the new float `e` for the loop to iterate over.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `test_list` contains the new float `e` for the loop to iterate over**
