Example Answer:
`my_list` is assigned an empty list. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floats that have been inputted during the loop iterations, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floats that have been inputted during the loop iterations, `my_list` is an empty list**
