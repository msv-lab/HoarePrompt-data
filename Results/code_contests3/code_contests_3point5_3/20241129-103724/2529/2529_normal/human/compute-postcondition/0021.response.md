The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the average jump coordinates for a given number of ships. The average jump coordinate is calculated by taking the sum of all jump coordinates and dividing it by the total number of ships. The function then returns the average jump coordinate. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the average jump coordinate for a given number of ships. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the average jump coordinate for a given number of ships.**
