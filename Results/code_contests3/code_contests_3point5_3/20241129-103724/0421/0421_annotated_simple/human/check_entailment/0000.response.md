Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described algorithm. It iterates through the input array and checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If it finds such a case, it sets the flag to False and breaks out of the loop. Then it removes the tallest stack from the array.

After iterating through the input array, it prints "YES" if the flag is True, indicating that the array can be sorted using the described procedure, and "NO" if the flag is False, indicating that the array cannot be sorted.

The program always follows the problem description as it checks for the condition where ravioli from a taller stack slides down on top of a lower stack due to a difference in height of two or more. It correctly determines if the input array can be sorted using the described algorithm.
