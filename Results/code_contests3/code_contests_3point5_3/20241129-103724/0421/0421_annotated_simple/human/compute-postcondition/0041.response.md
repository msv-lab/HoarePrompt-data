According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `nums` must still have a length of at least 2, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should not be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
