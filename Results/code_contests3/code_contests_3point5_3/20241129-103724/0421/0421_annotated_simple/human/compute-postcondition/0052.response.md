Example Answer:
The code prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`. The value of `flag` is determined by the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the updated `nums` list. If the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is True, otherwise, it is False. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is len(nums) - 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is len(nums) - 2**
