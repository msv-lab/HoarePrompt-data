Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2. The loop will execute until the second to last element of `nums`, checking if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If this condition is met at any point, `flag` is set to False, and the loop breaks.
