Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is len(nums) - 2 (last valid index), for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2. If there exists at least one pair of numbers in `nums` with an absolute difference greater or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, otherwise, `flag` remains True.**
