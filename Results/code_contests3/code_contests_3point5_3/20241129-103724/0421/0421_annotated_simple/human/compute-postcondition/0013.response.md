According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be k + 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` should be k + 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is k + 2**
