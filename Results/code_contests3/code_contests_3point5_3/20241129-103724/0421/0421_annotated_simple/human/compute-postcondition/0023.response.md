Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
