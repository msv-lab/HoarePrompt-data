Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2***
