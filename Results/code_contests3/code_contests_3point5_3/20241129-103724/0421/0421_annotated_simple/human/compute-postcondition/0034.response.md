Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum value from the list `nums`. Since `nums` is not empty and contains at least 2 elements, after removing the maximum value, the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` may change. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the modified `nums` list is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` will be set to False; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. The values of `n` and `ai` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False (based on the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the updated `nums` list), `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed)**
