Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, otherwise `flag` remains True.
