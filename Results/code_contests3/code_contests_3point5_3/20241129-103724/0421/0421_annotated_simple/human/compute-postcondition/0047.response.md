Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
