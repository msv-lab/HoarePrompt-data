Example Answer: 
`flag` is assigned the value `False`, which means the loop condition will not be satisfied and the loop will not execute again. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` satisfies the condition.
