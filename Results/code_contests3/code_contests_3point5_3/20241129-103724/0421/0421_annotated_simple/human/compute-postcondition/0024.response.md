Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
