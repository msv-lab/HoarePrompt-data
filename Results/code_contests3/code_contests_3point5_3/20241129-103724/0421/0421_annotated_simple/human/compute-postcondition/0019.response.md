According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False, and `nums` has one less element. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be adjusted to True and `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, and `nums` is not empty for the loop to execute again**
