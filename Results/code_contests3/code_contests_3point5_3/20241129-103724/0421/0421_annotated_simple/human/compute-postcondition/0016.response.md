Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is k + 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
