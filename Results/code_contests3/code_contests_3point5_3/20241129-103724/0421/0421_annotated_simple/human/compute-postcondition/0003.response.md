According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, and `flag` is True. To execute the loop one more time, you need to ensure that both `flag` remains True and `nums` is not empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty**
