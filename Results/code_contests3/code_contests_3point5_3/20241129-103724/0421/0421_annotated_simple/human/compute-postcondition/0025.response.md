According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and the condition involving the absolute difference between elements of `nums`. If the condition is met, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, and for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` should be incremented by 1, and the condition involving the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be satisfied.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` satisfies the condition**
