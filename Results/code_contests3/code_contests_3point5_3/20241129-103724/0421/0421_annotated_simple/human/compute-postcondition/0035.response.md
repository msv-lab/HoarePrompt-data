According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False based on the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the updated `nums` list, and `nums` is not empty with the maximum value removed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `flag` is currently False, it needs to be adjusted to True.
2. If `nums` is currently empty, it needs to be adjusted to not empty (with the maximum value removed).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed) for the loop to execute again**
