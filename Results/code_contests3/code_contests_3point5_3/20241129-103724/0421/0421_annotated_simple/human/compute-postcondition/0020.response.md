According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `len(nums)` is at least 2. However, the initial state does not guarantee that the loop will execute again, so adjustments need to be made. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2**
