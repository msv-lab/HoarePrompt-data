According to the code, the loop can execute if the `nums` list is not empty. The loop will iterate until the second-to-last element in the `nums` list, so the length of `nums` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer and `ai` containing n positive integers do not directly impact the loop execution. The `flag` being True also does not impact the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2**
