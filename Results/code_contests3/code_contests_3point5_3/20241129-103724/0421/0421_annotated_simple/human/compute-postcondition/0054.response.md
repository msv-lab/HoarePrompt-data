Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n`, followed by a list of positive integers `nums`. It then iterates through the list, removing elements with an absolute difference of 2 or more from their neighbors until no such elements exist. Finally, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of the flag variable. The code does not return a list of positive integers in reverse order as indicated in the annotations.**
