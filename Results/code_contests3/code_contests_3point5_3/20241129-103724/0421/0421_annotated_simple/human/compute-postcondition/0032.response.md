Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute again `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` satisfies the condition. If `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`, then `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
