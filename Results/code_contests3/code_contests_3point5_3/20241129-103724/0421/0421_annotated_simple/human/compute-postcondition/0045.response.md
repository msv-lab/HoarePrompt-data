According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 1, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that the length of `nums` is at least 2 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` must still be at least 2, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must still be less than 2. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with the maximum value removed), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
