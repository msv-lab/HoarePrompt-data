Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` contains n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be k + 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
