The function `func` reads an input value `n`, then reads a list of integers `nums` from the user. It iterates over `nums` and checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2. If the difference is greater or equal to 2, it sets the `flag` to False and breaks the loop. It then removes the maximum value from `nums`. After the loop, it prints 'YES' if `flag` is True and 'NO' if `flag` is False. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
