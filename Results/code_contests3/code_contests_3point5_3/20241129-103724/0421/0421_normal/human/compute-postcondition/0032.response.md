Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `nums` is a list with at least 4 elements and the maximum element removed with absolute difference between consecutive elements >= 2, `i` is the index before the last index of the list for the loop to execute one more time. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater or equal to 2, `flag` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
