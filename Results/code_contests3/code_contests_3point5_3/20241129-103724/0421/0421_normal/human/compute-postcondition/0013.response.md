According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` must not be empty, `i` is 1. 

To execute the loop a second time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` must not be empty, `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2**.
