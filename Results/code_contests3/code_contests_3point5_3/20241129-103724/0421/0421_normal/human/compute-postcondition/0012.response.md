Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` must not be empty, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. After the if else block executes, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
