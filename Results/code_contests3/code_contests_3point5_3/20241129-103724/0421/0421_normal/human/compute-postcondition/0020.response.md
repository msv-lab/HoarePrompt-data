According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, which means `i` is the second last index of the list before the loop starts. For the loop to execute, the list must have at least 2 elements, `flag` should remain True, and `i` should be the second last index of the list.
State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the second last index of the list, for the loop to execute `nums` has at least 2 elements**
