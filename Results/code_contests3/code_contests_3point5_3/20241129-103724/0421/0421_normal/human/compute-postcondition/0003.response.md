According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is assigned the user input value, `flag` is True. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is assigned the user input value, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must not be empty**
