According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed, and `i` is len(nums) - 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty. Additionally, the absolute difference between any consecutive elements in `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is len(nums) - 2**
