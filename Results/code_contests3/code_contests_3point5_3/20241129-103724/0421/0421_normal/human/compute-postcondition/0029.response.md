According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the last index of the list `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the user input value, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the last index of the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least 4 elements, and the last index `i` should be less than the new last index of the list after adding a new element.
State: **`n` is the user input value, `nums` is a list with at least 4 elements and the maximum element removed with absolute difference between consecutive elements >= 2, `i` is the index before the last index of the list for the loop to execute one more time**
