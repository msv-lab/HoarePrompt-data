Example Answer:
The maximum element is removed from the list `nums`. The value of `i` remains the same as it was before. The `flag` remains the same based on the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `nums` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the user input value, `flag` is True or False based on the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `nums` list, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed, `i` is the last index of the list.
Output State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True or False based on the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the modified `nums` list, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed, `i` is the last index of the list**
