Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last index of the list. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the loop will not execute again as `flag` is set to False.***
