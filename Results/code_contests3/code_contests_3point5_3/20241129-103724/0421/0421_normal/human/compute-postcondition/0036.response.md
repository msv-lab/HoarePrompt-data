According to the code, the loop can execute if the `nums` list has at least 2 elements. The loop iterates over the indices of the list up to the second to last element. The loop execution also depends on the `flag` variable being True. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last index of the list, for the loop to execute again `flag` should be True and `nums` should not be empty**
