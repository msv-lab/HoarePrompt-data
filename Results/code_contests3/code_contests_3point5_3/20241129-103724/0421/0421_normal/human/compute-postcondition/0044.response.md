Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last index of the list decremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the flag is set to False and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.***
