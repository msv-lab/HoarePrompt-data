Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. `i` is the second last index of the list and for the loop to execute, `nums` has at least 2 elements.***
