Example Answer:
`nums` is assigned the values from the user input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The value of `n` is not affected, and `flag` remains True. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the user input value, `flag` is True.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the user input value, `flag` is True**
