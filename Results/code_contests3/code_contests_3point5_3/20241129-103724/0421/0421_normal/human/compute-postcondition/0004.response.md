According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` is an empty list, the loop will not execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is assigned the user input value does not directly impact the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must not be empty, and `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is assigned the user input value, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must not be empty, `i` is 0**
