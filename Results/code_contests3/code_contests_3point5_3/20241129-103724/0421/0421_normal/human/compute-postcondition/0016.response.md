Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` must not be empty, `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop or if statement is broken.***
