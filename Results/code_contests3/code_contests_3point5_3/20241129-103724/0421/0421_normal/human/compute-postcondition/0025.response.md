According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the user input value, `flag` is True if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the second last index of the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `nums` must be at least 3 and `i` should be less than the length of `nums` - 1.
State: **`n` is the user input value, `flag` is True if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed and the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the last index of the list and for the loop to execute, `nums` has at least 3 elements**
