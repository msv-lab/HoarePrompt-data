Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input value, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last index of the list. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will break and we exit the loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
