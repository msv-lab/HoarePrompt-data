The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, a list of integers `nums`, and checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is less than 2. If this condition holds for all pairs of consecutive elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
