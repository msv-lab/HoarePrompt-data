Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the described algorithm. It reads an integer input `n`, a list of integers `nums`, and checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is less than 2. If this condition holds for all pairs of consecutive elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This aligns with the problem description where the program needs to determine if the array can be sorted using the described procedure based on the given conditions. The program handles the sliding of ravioli from taller stacks to shorter stacks as required by the problem description.
