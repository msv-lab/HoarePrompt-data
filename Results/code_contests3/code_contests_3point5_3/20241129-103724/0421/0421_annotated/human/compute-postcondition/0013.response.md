According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 1. If `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is true, then `flag` becomes False, and the loop breaks. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 2**.
