According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 which means `i` will be `len(nums) - 2`.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
