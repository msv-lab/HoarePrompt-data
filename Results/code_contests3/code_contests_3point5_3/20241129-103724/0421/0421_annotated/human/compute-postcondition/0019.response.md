According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, and `i` is len(nums) - 2. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is never greater than or equal to 2.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to make sure that `nums` still contains elements, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than or equal to 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is len(nums) - 2 and for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2**
