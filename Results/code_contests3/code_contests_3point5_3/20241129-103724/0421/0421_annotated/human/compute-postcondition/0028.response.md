Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is False, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
