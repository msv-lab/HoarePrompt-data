According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, and `i` is 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` must still contain at least 1 element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` must still contain at least 1 element**
