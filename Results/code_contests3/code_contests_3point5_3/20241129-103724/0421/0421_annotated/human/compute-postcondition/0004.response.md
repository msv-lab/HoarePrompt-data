According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` object. If `nums` contains at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. Since the loop iterates until `len(nums) - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `nums` has at least 2 integers. The initial state needs to be adjusted to `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 0**
