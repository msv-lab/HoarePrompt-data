Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `nums` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than 2.
Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than 2**
