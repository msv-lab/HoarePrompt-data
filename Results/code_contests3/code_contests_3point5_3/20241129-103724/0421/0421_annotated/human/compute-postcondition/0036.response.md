According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `flag` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `flag` is True, `nums` still contains at least 1 element, `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must still contain at least 1 element**
