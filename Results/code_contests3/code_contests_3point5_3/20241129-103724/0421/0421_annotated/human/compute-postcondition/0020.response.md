According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of len(nums) - 1. Since i starts at len(nums) - 2, it is necessary to adjust i to be within the valid range. Additionally, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must not be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is len(nums) - 2, for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than 2**
