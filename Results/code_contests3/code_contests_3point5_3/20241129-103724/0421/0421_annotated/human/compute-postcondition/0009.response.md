According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must also be checked to determine if `flag` needs to be updated.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**.
