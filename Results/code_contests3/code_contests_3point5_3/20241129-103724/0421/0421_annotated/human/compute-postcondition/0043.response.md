Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` must still contain at least 1 element and the absolute difference between the element at index 1 and the element at index 2 in `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
