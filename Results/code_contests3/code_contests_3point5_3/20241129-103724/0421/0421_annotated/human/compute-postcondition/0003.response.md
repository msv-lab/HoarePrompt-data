According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a map object containing integers. To ensure the loop executes the first time, `nums` needs to be a non-empty map object containing integers.
State: **`flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers**
