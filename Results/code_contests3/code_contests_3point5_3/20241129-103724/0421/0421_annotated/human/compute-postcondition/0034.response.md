Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum value from the `nums` map object. This removal might change the order of elements in the map, but it does not affect the absolute difference condition mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the `flag` remains unaffected.
Output State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
