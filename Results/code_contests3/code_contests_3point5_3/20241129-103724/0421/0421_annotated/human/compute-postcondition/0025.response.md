According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should not be greater than 2.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than 2**
