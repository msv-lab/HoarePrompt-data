According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i + 1` in `nums` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` must still contain at least 1 element and the absolute difference between the element at index 1 and the element at index 2 in `nums` must be greater than or equal to 2**
