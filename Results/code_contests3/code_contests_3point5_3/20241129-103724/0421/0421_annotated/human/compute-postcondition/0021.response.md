Postcondition: ***`flag` is True, `nums` is a map object containing integers with at least 1 element, `i` is len(nums) - 2, for the loop to execute again the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than 2. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2***
