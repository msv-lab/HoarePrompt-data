Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem description. Here is a case where the program does not work as expected:

Input:
3
3 1 2

Expected Output:
NO

Actual Output:
YES

In this case, the program should output "NO" because the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide onto the stack of height 1, causing the algorithm to output an array {2, 2, 2}, which is not correctly sorted. Since the program does not produce the correct output for this case, the correctness is **False**.
