Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where there are more than three consonants in a row with at least two different letters. In such cases, the program should insert spaces to separate the consonants into individual words to fix the typo. 

For example, if the input word is "hackcerrs", the program should output "hack cerrs" to fix the typo. But the program does not handle this case correctly.
