Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It checks for blocks of three or more consonants in a row and inserts spaces between them to split the word into multiple words without any typos. The program handles the case where there are at least two different letters in the block of consonants, as specified in the problem description. The program also prints the word without any changes if there are no typos. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
