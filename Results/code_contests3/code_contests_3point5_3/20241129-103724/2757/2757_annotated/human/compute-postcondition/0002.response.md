Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a string `ch` consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000. It returns True if the string `ch` does not contain any vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), otherwise it returns False.** 

The code does what the annotations describe, where it checks if the input string contains any vowels and returns the opposite. However, one potential edge case missing from the annotations is when the input string is empty. In this case, the function should ideally return True since an empty string technically does not contain any vowels.
