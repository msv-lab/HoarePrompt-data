Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the string S, incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' encountered and decrementing it by 1 for each 'D' encountered. The result is then checked to ensure it is not negative before being printed. The logic of the program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, therefore it is correct.
