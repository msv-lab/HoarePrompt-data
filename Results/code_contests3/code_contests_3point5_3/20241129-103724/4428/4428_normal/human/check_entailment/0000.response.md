Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates over the characters in the string `S` and increments the result by 1 for each occurrence of 'I' and decrements it by 1 for other characters. If the final result is negative, it is set to 0. The code exactly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. The given examples also produce the expected output.
