Example Answer:
`result` is incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `result` was 1, the new value will be 2. If the previous value was -1, the new value will be 0. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `S` is a string, `result` is either 0 or 2, `i` is the index of the next iteration incremented by 1.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `S` is a string, `result` is either 0 or 2, `i` is the index of the next iteration incremented by 1**
