Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `S` is a string, `result` is either 1 or -1, `i` is the index of the next iteration. If the character at index `i` in string `S` is 'I', then `result` is incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` in string `S` is not 'I', then `result` remains the same.***
