Functionality: **The function func reads an integer N from the user and a string S. It then iterates over the characters in S, incrementing the result by 1 for each occurrence of 'I' and decrementing it by 1 for other characters. If the final result is negative, it is set to 0. The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value.**
