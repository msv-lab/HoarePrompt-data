Postcondition: ***`N` is an input integer, `S` is an input string; `result` is either 1 or -1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in string `S` is 'I', then `result` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `S` is not 'I', then `result` is -1.***
