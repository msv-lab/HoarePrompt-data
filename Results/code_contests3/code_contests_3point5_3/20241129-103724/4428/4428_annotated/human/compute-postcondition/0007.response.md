Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `result` is 0, after execution, `result` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing at least one 'I' character, result is -1, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. In this case, S[i] is not equal to 'I'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing at least one 'I' character, result is -1, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. In this case, S[i] is not equal to 'I'**
