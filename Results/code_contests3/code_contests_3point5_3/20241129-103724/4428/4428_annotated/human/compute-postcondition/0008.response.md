Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing at least one 'I' character, result is either 1 or -1, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. If S[i] == 'I', the result is 1 and the character at index i in S is 'I'. If S[i] != 'I', the result is -1 and the character at index i in S is not 'I'.***
