Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing at least one 'I' character, result can be either 3, 1, or -1. If S[i] == 'I', the result is either 3 or 1, and for the loop to execute the third time i is 2. If S[i] != 'I', the result is either 1 or -1, and for the loop to execute the third time i is 2.***
