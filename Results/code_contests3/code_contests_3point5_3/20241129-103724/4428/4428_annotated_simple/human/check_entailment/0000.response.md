Correctness: **True**

The program correctly increments or decrements the value of `result` based on the characters in the string `S` as described in the problem description. It then ensures that the final result is not negative by setting it to 0 if it is negative. The program calculates the maximum value of `result` during the operations, which is the correct output according to the problem description. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
