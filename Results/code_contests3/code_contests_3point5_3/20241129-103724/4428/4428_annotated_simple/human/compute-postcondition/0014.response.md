Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is either 1 or -1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `result` is either 2 or 0. The value of `i` is not affected. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either 2 or 0, i is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
