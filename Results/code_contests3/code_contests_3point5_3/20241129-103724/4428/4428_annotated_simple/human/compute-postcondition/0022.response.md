The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the constraints provided. The function takes in a positive integer `N` such that 1 <= N <= 100 and a string `S` of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function does not have any input parameters specified in the function definition.

The function returns an array of integers. The output array is constructed based on the input string `S` following a specific pattern. The pattern is as follows:
- If the character in the string `S` is 'I', the output array element is the smallest integer not used before in the output array.
- If the character in the string `S` is 'D', the output array element is the largest integer not used before in the output array.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate an array of integers based on the input string `S`, with 'I' indicating the smallest unused integer and 'D' indicating the largest unused integer.
