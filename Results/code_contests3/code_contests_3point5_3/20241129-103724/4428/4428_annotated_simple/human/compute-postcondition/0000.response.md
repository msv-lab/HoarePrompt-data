Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The value of `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100. S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100. S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'**
