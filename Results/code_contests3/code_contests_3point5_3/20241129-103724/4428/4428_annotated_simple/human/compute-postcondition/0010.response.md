Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either 1 or -1, i is 1 for the loop to execute again, result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either 1 or -1, i is 1 for the loop to execute again, result is incremented by 1**
