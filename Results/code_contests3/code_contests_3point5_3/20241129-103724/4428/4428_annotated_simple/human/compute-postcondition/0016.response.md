Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. If S[i] == 'I', the result is either 2 or 0 and i is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If S[i] != 'I', the result is either 0 or -2 and i is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.***
