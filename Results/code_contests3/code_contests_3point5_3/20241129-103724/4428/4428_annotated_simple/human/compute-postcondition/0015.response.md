Example Answer:
`result` is decremented by 1, so if the previous value of `result` was 1, it would become 0, and if the previous value of `result` was -1, it would become -2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either 0 or -2, i is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 100, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', result is either 0 or -2, i is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
