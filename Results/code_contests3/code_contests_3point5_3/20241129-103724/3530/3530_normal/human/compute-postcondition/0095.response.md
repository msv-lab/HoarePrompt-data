Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as `n` remains greater than 0 and the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are met. The final state will depend on the specific values of the variables at each iteration.**
