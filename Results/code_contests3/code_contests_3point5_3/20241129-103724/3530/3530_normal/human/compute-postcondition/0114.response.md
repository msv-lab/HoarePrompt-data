According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 0, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
