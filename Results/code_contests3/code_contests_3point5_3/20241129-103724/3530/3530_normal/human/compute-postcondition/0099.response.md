Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of the variables are given as follows: `dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on loop conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, `mask & 1 << j` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true. After executing the code, the Output State is: *`dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on loop conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, `mask & 1 << j` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on loop conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, `mask & 1 << j` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`**
