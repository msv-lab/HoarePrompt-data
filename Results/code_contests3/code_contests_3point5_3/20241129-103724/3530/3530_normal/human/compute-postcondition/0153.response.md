According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
