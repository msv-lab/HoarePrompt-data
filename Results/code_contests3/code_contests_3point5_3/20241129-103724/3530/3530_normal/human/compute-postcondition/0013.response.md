According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[0][i]` is assigned 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than 0, and the value of `i` should be within the range of `1 << n` after being incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `1 << n + 1` is a valid range, `dp[0][i+1]` is assigned 1**
