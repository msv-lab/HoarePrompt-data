The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a matrix of size N x N, where N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and each element a_{i,j} of the matrix is either 0 or 1 for all i,j where 1 <= i,j <= N. The function does not return any specific value but performs operations on the input matrix.
