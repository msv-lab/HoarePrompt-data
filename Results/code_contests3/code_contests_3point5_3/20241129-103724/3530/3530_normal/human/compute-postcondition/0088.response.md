Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are updated, and `a[i - 1][j]` is used to calculate the new value. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated for the next iteration, and `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated for the next iteration, and `n` is greater than 0**
