Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is also set to 1, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will depend on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `i`, `mask`, and `j`. 
Output State: **Updated values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` based on the calculated result.**
