According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is set, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented, and `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **`dp` is set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1**.
