According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range of `0` to `n-1`. The initial value of `i` being `n + 1` does not directly affect the loop execution. The key condition for the loop to execute is that `mask` should be in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, and `j` is 0.
State: **`dp` set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 0**
