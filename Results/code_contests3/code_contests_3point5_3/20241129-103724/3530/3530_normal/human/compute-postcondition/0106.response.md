According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the loop index `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j+1] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << (j+1)` are met. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+2`, `a[i - 1][j+2]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << (j+2)` are updated based on loop conditions to execute the loop for one more time**
