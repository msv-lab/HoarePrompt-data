According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo MOD if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo MOD if `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1 and the (j + 1)-th bit of `mask` is set**.
