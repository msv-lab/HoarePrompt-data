According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `_` is equal to n-1 implies that `_` is equal to n-1. Since `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, it means that there are n lists in the list `a`. The condition `dp[0][i] is assigned 1 for every i in the range 1 << n` ensures that dp is a 2D list with values assigned accordingly. For the loop to execute, `i` should be in the range 1 to n inclusive. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with values assigned, and `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with values assigned, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive**
