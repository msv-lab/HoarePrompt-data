Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The loop will execute when `i` is at least 1 and `j` is 0. The condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)` needs to be true for the addition to take place.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. `n` is at least 0, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. Additionally, if condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)` is true.**
