According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `mask` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0 and `mask` should be incremented by 1**
