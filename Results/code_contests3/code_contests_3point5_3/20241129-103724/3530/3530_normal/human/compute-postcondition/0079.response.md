Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` are set for the calculation. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo of `MOD`. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.***
