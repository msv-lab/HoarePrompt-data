Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` based on the calculated result.
Output State: **Updated values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` based on the calculated result.**
