Postcondition: ***`dp` is set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1. After the execution, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
