Since the loop iterates from 1 to n inclusive, the next iteration will occur for i = n + 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, with the final values dependent on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`, `i` is n + 1**
