Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and other variables are unknown, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`**
