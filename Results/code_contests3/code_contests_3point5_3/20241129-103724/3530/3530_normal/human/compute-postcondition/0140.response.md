Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `j`, and `mask` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code, `j` is 3, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code, `j` is 3, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation**
