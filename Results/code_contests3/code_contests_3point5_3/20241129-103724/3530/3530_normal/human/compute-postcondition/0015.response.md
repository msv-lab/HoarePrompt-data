According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the range `1 << n + 1`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `1 << n + 1` is a valid range, `dp[0][i+1]` is assigned 1, `dp[0][i]` is assigned 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 0, the range `1 << n + 2` must be valid, `dp[0][i+2]` should be assigned 1, and `dp[0][i+1]` should be assigned 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `1 << n + 2` is a valid range, `dp[0][i+2]` is assigned 1, `dp[0][i+1]` is assigned 1**
