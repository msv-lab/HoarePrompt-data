According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, so it needs to be adjusted to `mask` is less than `1 << n - 1` and `j` is now 1. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1`**
