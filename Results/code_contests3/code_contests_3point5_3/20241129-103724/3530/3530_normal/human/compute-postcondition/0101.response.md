Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << j` are updated based on loop conditions. `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j` are met. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is determined.***
