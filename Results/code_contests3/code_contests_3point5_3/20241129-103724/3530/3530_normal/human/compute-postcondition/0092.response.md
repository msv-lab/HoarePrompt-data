Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are updated for the next iteration. The values of `a[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are also updated. For the loop to execute another time, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` is updated for the next iteration, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are also updated, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n + 1.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` is updated for the next iteration, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are also updated, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n + 1**
