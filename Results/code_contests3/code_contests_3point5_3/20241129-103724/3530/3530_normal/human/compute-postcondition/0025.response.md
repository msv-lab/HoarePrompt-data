According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than 0, `_` should be equal to n, `a` should still contain n lists of integers, `dp` should remain the same, and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to n+1 inclusive**
