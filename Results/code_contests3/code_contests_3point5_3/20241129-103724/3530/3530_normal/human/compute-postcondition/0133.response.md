Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` has been modulo'd with `MOD`.***
