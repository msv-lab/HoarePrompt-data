Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `MOD` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the specified conditions.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the specified conditions**
