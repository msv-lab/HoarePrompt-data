Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive. If the element at index j in the i-th list of `a` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of the `mask` is set, then the program's state is as described above.***
