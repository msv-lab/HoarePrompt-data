Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, _ is equal to n, a is a list containing n lists of integers, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is in the range 1 to n+1 inclusive, j is 1, mask is 1 left shifted by j, dp[i][mask] is updated, and the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is true. After the execution of the if else block, dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.***
