Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1` inclusive, `j` is 2, `mask` is 1 left shifted by `j`, condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is true. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`.**
