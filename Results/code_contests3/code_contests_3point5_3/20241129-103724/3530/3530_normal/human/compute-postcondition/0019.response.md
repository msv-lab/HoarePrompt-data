According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is in the range 1 to (1 << n). Before the loop starts, `n` is already greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1 indicates the last possible index value. `a` is a list containing n lists of integers implies that there are n lists in the list `a`. `dp` is a 2D list where dp[0][i] is assigned 1 for every i in the range 1 << n indicates initial values set in the 2D list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n-1, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list where dp[0][i] is assigned 1 for every i in the range 1 << n, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range 1 to n inclusive**
