Functionality: **The function `func` processes a matrix of size N x N, where N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and each element a_{i,j} of the matrix is either 0 or 1 for all i,j where 1 <= i,j <= N. The function initializes a dynamic programming array, updates its values based on specific conditions using bitwise operations, and finally prints a specific value from the array. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.**
