Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` has been incremented by `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j-th` bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`.**
