Output State: **`dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` has been updated for all valid values of `n`, `mask`, and `j` based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The final value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` will be calculated by updating it with the previous value of `dp[n - 1][(1 << (n - 1)) ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD` for all valid values of `mask` and `j`. The other variables `n`, `_`, `a`, and `MOD` will remain the same as in the initial state.**
