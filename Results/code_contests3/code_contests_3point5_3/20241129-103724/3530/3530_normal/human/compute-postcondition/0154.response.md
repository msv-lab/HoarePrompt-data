Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The loop code has been executed for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is incremented by 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. After the execution of this code, the state of `dp[i][mask]` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
