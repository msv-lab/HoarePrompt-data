Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `j` is 3, so `1 << j` is 8. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code, `j` is 3, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code, `j` is 3, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1**.
