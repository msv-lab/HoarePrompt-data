Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The loop code has already updated `dp[i][mask]` for all valid values of `j`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and `mask` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, the program condition holds true. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is incremented by 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, the program condition holds true.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`, `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is incremented by 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, the program condition holds true**
