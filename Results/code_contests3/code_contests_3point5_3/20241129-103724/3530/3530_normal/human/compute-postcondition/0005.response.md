According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be 1 more than its previous value.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `a` is a list containing the integers obtained by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces**
