Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated for the next iteration, and `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated for the next iteration, and `n` is greater than 0**
