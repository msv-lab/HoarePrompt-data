Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are set for the calculation. For the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on the calculated result.***
