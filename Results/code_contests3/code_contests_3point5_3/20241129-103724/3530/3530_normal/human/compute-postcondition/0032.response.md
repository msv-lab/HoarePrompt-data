Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to n+1 inclusive, `j` is updated to n. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is true, then the program updates the state accordingly.***
