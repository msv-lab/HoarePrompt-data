Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `a[i - 1][j+1]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << (j+1)` are updated based on loop conditions. `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j+1] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << (j+1)` are met. If `a[i - 1][j+1]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << (j+1)` is true, then the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is determined. After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
