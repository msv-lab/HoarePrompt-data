Output State: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated for all valid values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The final values of `dp[i][mask]` will be calculated by updating it with the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD` for all valid values of `mask` and `j`. The other variables `n`, `_`, `a`, and `MOD` will remain the same as in the initial state.
