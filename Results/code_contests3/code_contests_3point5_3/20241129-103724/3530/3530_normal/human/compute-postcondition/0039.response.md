Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, _ is equal to n, a is a list containing n lists of integers, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is in the range 1 to n+1 inclusive, j is 0, mask is 0 for the loop to execute. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.***
