Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0 and `mask` should be incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, then the program condition holds true.***
