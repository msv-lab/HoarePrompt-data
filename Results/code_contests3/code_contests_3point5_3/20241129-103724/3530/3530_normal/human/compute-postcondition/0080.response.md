Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` are set for the calculation. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop code, ensuring that the final state reflects the accumulated changes made during each iteration.**
