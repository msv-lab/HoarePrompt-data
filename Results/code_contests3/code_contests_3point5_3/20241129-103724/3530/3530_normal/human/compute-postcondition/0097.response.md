According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 and the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are met. Before the loop starts, the values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop. Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on loop conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, `mask & 1 << j` are met**
