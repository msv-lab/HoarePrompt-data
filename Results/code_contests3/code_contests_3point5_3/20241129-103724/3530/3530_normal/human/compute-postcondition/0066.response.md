According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. Since `mask` is an important variable in determining the loop execution, it needs to be adjusted. Also, since after all iterations of the loop, the variables `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`, we need to ensure that the initial values of `dp` are set appropriately for this calculation. Furthermore, `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1` to represent the final state after all iterations.

State: **Initial values of `dp` set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`**
