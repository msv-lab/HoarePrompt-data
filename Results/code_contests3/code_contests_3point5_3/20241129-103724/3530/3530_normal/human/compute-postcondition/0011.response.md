According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range `1 << n`, so the loop will execute as long as the result of `1 << n` is a valid range. Before the loop starts, the value of `MOD`, `_`, `a`, and `dp` do not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `1 << n` is a valid range**
