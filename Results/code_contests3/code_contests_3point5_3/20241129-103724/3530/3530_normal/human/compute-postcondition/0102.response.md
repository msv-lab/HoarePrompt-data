According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value.
State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `a[i - 1][j+1]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << (j+1)` are updated based on loop conditions. `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j+1] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << (j+1)` are met. If `a[i - 1][j+1]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << (j+1)` is true, then the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is determined.**
