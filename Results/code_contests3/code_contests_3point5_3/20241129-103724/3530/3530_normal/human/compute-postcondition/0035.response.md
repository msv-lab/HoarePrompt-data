According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is updated to n, so to execute the loop, `j` should be set to 0. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, so `n` should be greater than or equal to 1. The loop should update `mask` to the next consecutive value after the last iteration, so `mask` should be set to 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to n, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to n+1 inclusive, `j` is 0, `mask` is 0 for the loop to execute**
