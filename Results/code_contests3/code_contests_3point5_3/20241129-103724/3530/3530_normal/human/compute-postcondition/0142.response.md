Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the loop code for all valid values of `j`. The loop has executed for all values of `j` in the range of `n`. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` depends on the conditions specified in the loop and the previous state of `dp[i-1][mask]` for all `mask` less than `1 << n - 1`.**
