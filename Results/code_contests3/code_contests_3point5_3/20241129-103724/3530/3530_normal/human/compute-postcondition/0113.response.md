According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, so it needs to be adjusted to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `n + 1. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `n + 1` for the loop to execute**
