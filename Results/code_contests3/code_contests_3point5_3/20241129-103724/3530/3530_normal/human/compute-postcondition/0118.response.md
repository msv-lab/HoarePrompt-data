Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. `n` is at least 0, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.***
