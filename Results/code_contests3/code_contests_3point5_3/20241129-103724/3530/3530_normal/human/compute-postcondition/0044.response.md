According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1` inclusive, `j` is 1, `mask` is 1 left shifted by `j`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is true. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1` inclusive, `j` is 2, `mask` is 1 left shifted by `j`, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is true. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD**`.
