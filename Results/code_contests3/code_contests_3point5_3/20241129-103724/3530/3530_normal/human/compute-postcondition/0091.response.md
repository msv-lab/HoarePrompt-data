According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated for the next iteration, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n + 1`.
State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` is updated for the next iteration, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are also updated, and for the loop to execute another time `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `n + 1**.
