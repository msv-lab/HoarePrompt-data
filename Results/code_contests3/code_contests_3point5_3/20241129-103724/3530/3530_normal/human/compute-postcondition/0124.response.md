Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This addition is done if `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1 and the (j + 1)-th bit of `mask` is set. The specific values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `a[i - 1][j + 1]`, and `mask` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo MOD if `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1 and the (j + 1)-th bit of `mask` is set.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo MOD if `a[i - 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1 and the (j + 1)-th bit of `mask` is set**
