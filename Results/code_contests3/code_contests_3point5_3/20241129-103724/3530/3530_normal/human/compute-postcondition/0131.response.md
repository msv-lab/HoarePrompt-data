Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The loop will execute again if `mask` is less than `1 << n - 1`. Given that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is also set to 1, the calculation will be based on these conditions. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions specified, `j` is 1, `mask` should be less than `1 << n - 1`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1.**
