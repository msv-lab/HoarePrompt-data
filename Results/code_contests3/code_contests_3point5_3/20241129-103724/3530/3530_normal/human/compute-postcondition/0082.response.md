According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `dp`, `i`, `mask + 1`, and `a[i - 1][j]` should be set appropriately for the calculation
- `j` should be set based on the range of `n`
- `dp[i][mask + 1]` should also be appropriately set

State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are set for the calculation, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
