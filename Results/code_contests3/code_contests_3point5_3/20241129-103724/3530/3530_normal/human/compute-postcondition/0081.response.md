According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask` and `n`. If `mask` is less than `1 << n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` are set for the calculation. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are set for the calculation**.
