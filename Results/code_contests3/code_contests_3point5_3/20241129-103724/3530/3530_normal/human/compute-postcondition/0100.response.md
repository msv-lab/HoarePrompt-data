Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is not affected by the code.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated based on loop conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, `mask & 1 << j` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`**
