Example Answer:
`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1, where `i` is within the valid range `1 << n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `1 << n` is a valid range, `dp[0][i]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute `1 << n` is a valid range, `dp[0][i]` is assigned 1**
