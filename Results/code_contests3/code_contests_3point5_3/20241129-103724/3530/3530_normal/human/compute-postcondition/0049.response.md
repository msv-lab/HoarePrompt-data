According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1`, `j` is equal to `n`, `mask` is the last value after all iterations of the loop have finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `1 << n+1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1`, `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than `1 << n+1`**
