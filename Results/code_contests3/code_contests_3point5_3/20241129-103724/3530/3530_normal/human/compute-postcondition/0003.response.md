According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `a` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `_` starts at 0. 
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is an empty list**
