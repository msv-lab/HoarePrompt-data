According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i = n` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code, with the final values dependent on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. The other variables will remain the same as in the initial state. `i` is updated to `n + 1`.**
