According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be 2 and `n` should remain greater than 0.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `a` is a list containing the integers obtained by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces for the loop to execute a second time**
