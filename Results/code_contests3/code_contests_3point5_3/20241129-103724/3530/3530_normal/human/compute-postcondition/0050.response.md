According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range of 0 to `n-1`. At the beginning, `j` is equal to `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to be in the range of 0 to `n-1` for the loop to execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `1 << n+1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1`, `j` is in the range 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than `1 << n+1`**
