Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are updated for the next iteration. `a[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][mask + 1]` are also updated. For the loop to execute another time, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than `n + 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the program state remains the same with the described updates.***
