Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is in the range 1 to `n+1`, `j` is in the range 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than `1 << n+1`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask & 1 << j` is true, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
