Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `MOD`. The previous values of the variables are known: `dp` is set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo of `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp` is set for the calculation, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo of `MOD`**
