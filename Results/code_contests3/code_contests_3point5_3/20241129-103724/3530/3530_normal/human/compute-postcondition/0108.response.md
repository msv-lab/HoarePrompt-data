Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD` of its current value. The other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `j+2`, `a[i - 1][j+2]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << (j+2)` are updated based on loop conditions to execute the loop for one more time. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i-1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+2`, `a[i - 1][j+2]`, `dp[i][mask + 1]`, `n`, `mask & 1 << (j+2)` are updated based on loop conditions to execute the loop for one more time. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i-1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`**
