You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for all i and j where 1 <= i, j <= N.**
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements after the loop execution, each element of `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the integer conversion to the input split by space
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `(1 << n)` elements initialized to 0, for all values of `i` in the range of `(1 << n)`, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a fully updated 2D list with all values calculated based on the loop conditions. Each dp[i][mask] value represents the final result of the calculations performed in the loop for all valid combinations of i and mask. The loop has iterated through all possible combinations of i and mask, updating dp[i][mask] according to the given conditions for all iterations.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and a 2D list `a` of size `n x n`. It then performs a series of calculations on the elements of `a` based on the binary representation of `n`. Finally, it prints the result of the calculations stored in a 2D list `dp` at the specific index `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The function operates within constraints specified for `n` and `a_{i, j}`, and the calculations involve bitwise operations and modular arithmetic.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
