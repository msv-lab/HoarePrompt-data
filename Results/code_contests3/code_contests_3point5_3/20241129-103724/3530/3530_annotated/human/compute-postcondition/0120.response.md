Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known. After execution, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the formula given. 
Output State: **dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, j is increased by 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula**.
