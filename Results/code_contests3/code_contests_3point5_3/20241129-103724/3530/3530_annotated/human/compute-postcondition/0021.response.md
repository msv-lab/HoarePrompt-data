Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `(1 << n)` elements initialized to 0, for all values of `i` in the range of `(1 << n)`, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 up to `(1 << n) - 1` for the loop to execute, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true***
