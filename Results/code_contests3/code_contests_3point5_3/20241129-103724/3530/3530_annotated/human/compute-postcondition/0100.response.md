Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. Since `MOD` is 1000000007, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the remainder when divided by 1000000007. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains n elements, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `mask` is n+3, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and mask has the jth bit set to 1.
