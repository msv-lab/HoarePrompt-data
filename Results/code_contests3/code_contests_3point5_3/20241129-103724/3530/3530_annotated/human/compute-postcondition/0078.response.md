Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo of the current value. The modulo operation is performed with MOD, which is 1000000007. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1, j is less than n+1, a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, j is updated to j+1. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1, j is less than n+1, a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, j is updated to j+1. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.**
