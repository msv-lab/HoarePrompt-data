Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `(1 << n)` elements, for all values of `i` in the range of `(1 << n)`, `dp[0][i]` is initialized to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 up to `(1 << n) - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` such that `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
