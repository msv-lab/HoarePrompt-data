According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as j is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates over j, for the loop to execute another time, j needs to be less than n+1.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, j is less than n+1**
