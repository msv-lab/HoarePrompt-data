Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (n-1)], where j is n-1, and dp[i][mask] is now taken modulo MOD, for the loop to execute one more time mask needs to be within the range from 1 up to (1 << n), j is 0. In addition, at index i-1 in list a, the value at index j is 1 and the mask has the j-th bit set.***
