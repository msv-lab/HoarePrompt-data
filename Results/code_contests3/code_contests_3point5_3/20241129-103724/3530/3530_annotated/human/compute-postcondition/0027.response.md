Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `(1 << n)` elements, for all values of `i` in the range of `(1 << n)`, `dp[0][i]` is initialized to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 up to `(1 << n) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be in the range of `n, dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and finally, `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
