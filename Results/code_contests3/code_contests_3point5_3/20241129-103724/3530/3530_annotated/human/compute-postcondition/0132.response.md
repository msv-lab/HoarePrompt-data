Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of `MOD`. Since the values of other variables are not affected by this operation, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is increased by 1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, j is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute one more time, mask should be within the range of 1 to 2^n+1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
