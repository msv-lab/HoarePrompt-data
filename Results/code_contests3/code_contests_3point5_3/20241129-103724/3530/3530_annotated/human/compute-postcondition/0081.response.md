According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the mask is less than 2^n. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+1. For the loop to execute another time, the mask should be less than 2^n. So for the loop to execute one more time, the mask should be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2 for the loop to execute another time**
