Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with modulo operation using MOD. The value of `mask` is `n+2`, `j` is 1, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` is satisfied. Therefore, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated and stored in the 2D list `dp`. Other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute again j is 1, if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, dp[i][mask] is updated with the modulo operation using MOD**
