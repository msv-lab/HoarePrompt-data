Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, j is less than n+1, if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo with MOD.***
