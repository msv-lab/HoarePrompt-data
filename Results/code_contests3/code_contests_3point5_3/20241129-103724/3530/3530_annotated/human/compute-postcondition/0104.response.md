Example Answer: 
After taking the modulo operation, the value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the remainder when divided by MOD. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the second time j is 1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask has the jth bit set to 1, dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the second time j is 1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask has the jth bit set to 1, dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after taking modulo MOD**
