According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, and for the loop to execute one more time `_` needs to be less than `n`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be increased by 1 to meet the condition of being less than `n`.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n+1` elements after the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n+1`, `a` appends the result of mapping integer conversion to the input split by space**
