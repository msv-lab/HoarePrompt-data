Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, dp[i][mask] is now updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where j is 0, dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD, for the loop to execute one more time mask needs to be within the range from 1 up to (1 << n), at index i-1 in list a, the value at index j is 1 and the mask has the j-th bit set.**
