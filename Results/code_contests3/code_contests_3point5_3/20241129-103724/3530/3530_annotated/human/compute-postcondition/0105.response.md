Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the second time j is 1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask has the jth bit set to 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after taking modulo MOD.***
