Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. This ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of `MOD`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is increased by 1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n+1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1, and dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided by taking modulo with MOD.
