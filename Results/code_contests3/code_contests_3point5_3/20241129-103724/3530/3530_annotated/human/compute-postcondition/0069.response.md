Output State: *MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time. The value at index i-1, j in a is 1 and the jth bit in mask is set. After execution of the code snippet, the value of dp at index i and mask is incremented by the value of dp at index i-1 and mask with the jth bit toggled (XOR 1 << j).*
