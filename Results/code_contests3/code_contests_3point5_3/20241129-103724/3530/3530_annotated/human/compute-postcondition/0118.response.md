Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, the program proceeds to the next iteration.***
