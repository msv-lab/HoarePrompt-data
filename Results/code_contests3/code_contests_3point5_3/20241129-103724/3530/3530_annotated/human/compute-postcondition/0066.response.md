According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the mask is within the range from 1 to 2^n-1. Since n is greater than 1, there will be at least 2 iterations of the loop. Before the loop starts, the MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, and dp is a 2D list with fully updated values. For the loop to execute another time, the mask needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, for the loop to execute another time, mask is incremented by 1**
