Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with MOD. The other variables remain the same with `i` being updated to `i+1`, `mask` within the range of 1 to 2^n, and `j` being increased by 1. Since we only modified `dp[i][mask]`, the Output State is: dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, j is increased by 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula.
Output State: **dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, j is increased by 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula**
