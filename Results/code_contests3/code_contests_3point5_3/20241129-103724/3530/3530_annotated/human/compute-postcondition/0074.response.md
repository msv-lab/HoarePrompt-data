Example Answer:
After taking the modulo operation with MOD, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, j is less than n+1, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking modulo with MOD.
