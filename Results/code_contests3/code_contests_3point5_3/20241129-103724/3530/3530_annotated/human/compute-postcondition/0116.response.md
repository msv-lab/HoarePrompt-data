Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of i is incremented by 1. The element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted by j is true. The MOD value remains constant. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, the element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted by j is true.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, the element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted by j is true.**
