Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+1 for the loop to execute another time. For each value of j from 0 to n-1, if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and the jth bit in mask is set, then the value of dp at index i and mask is updated by adding the value of dp at index i-1 and mask with the jth bit toggled (XOR 1 << j) and then taking the modulo with MOD.**
