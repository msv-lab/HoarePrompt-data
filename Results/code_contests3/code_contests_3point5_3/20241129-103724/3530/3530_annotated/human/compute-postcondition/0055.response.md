According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is less than `n`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented to the next value.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, j is incremented by 1 for the next iteration**
