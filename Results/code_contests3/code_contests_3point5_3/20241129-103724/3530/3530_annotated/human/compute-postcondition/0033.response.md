Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n) - 1. The loop iterates through each value of j in the range of n, checks if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and if mask has the jth bit set. If both conditions are true, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking the result modulo MOD. The loop continues until it has iterated through all values of j for each value of i.**
