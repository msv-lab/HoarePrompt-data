Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j+1)] where j is increased by 1, and dp[i][mask] is now taken modulo MOD. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the program updates dp[i][mask] as described, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than n.**
