According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range of n. Before the loop starts, the given states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (n-1)], where j is n-1, and dp[i][mask] is now taken modulo MOD, for the loop to execute one more time mask needs to be within the range from 1 up to (1 << n), j is 0**
