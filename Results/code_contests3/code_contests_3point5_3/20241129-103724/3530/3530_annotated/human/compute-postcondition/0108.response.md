Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with MOD. As the previous values of the variables are not mentioned, the output state is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the third time j is 2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, mask has the jth bit set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the third time j is 2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, mask has the jth bit set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated modulo MOD**
