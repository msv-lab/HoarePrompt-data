Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)], where j is 2. If a[i - 1][2] is equal to 1 and the 2nd bit of mask is set, then the update occurs with the modulo operation using MOD. The previous values of MOD, n, a, dp, mask, and j are known. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute again j is 2. dp[i][mask] is updated based on the provided condition.**
