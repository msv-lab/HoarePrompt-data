Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `^` is the XOR operator. This operation is performed for all values of `i` and `mask` in the specified ranges. The Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list where each row has `(1 << n)` elements with updated values, `mask` is in the range from 1 up to `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is in the range of `n`.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains `n` elements, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `mask` is in the range from 1 up to `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is in the range of `n`**
