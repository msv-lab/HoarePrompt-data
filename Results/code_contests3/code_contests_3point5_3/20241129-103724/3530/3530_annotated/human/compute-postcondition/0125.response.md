Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, j is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time j is less than n, dp[i][mask] is updated with the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD**
