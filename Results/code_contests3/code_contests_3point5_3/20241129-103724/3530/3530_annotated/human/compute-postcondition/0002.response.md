Example Answer:
`a` is assigned an empty list. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is an empty list.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is an empty list**
