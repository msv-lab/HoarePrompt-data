Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo MOD. The value of `MOD` is 1000000007. Therefore, after execution, the output state is `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains n elements, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values using the given formula, and `dp[i][mask]` is now updated and taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, dp[i][mask] is now updated and taken modulo MOD**
