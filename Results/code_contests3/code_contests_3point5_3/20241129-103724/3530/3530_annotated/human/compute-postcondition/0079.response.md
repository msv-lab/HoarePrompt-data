Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1, j is less than n+1, a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is satisfied, for each iteration j is updated to j+1. After the if statement executes, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.***
