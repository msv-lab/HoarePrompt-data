Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (n-1)], where j is n-1, and dp[i][mask] is now taken modulo MOD. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << (n-1), then the program updates dp[i][mask] as described for all values of mask within the specified range.**
