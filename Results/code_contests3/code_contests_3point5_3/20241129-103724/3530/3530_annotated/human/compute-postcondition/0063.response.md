Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values. The loop will update dp[i][mask] for all j values in the range from 0 to n-1, where a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j. The values of dp[i][mask] will be updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] % MOD.**
