Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, mask is in the range from 1 up to (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated using the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where j is 0. In the current state, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1.**
