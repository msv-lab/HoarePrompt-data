Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is retrieved based on the previous calculations. Since `a[i - 1][j] = 1` and the jth bit of `mask` is set, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute the first time j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set.**
