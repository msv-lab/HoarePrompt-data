Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with updated values, j is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time j is less than n. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking modulo operation with MOD.***
