Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values based on the loop conditions. Each dp[i][mask] value represents the result of the calculations performed in the loop for all valid combinations of i and mask. The loop iterates through all possible combinations of i and mask, updating dp[i][mask] according to the given conditions.**
