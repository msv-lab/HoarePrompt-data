Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]. Here, n is the number of elements in list a, and dp is a 2D list that has been fully updated with all values calculated based on loop conditions. The expression (1 << n) - 1 represents a bitmask where all n bits are set to 1.

Output State: **The program prints the final result stored in dp[n][(1 << n) - 1].**
