Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute the first time j is 0, if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, dp[i][mask] is updated with the modulo operation using MOD.***
