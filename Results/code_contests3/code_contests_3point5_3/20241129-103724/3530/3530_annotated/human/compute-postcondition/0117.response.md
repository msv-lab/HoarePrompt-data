Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its current value modulo MOD. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, i is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute mask is within the range of 1 to 2^n, the element at index i-1 and j in list a is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted by j is true.
