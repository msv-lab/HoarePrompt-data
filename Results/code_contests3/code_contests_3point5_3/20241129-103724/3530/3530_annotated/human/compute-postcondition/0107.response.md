Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The `mask ^ 1 << j` operation flips the jth bit in `mask` and returns a new mask value. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask]` and the newly calculated mask value. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the third time j is 2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, mask has the jth bit set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula mentioned above.
