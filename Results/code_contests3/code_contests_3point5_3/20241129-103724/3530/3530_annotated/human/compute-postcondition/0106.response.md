According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2. 
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+3, for the loop to execute the third time j is 2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask has the jth bit set to 1**
