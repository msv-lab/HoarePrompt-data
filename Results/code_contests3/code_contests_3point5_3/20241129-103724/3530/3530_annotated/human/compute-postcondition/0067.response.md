According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute. However, for the loop to execute another time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time**
