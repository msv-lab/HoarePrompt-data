Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. This operation ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute again j is 2.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 1, a contains n elements, dp is a 2D list with fully updated values, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute again j is 2**
