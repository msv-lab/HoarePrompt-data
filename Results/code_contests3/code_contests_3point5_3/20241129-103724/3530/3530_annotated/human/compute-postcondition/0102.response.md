According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains n elements, `dp` is a 2D list with fully updated values, `mask` is n+3, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask has the jth bit set to 1**
