The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and a 2D list `a` of size `n x n`. It then performs a series of calculations on the elements of `a` based on the binary representation of `n`. Finally, it prints the result of the calculations stored in a 2D list `dp` at the specific index `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The function operates within constraints specified for `n` and `a_{i, j}`, and the calculations involve bitwise operations and modular arithmetic.
