Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the loop executes, and the values in `dp[i][mask + 1]` are updated accordingly.***
