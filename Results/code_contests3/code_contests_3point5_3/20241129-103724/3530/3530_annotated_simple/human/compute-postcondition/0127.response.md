Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` will be updated based on the loop logic. The loop will execute `n` times, and if the conditions in the if statement are met, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated accordingly by taking the modulo `MOD`.**
