Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values to integers, and `a.append` appends these converted values to the list `a`. The value of `_` is incremented by 1. The previous state of all variables is known, so after execution, the new state is: N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` contains the new appended list of integers, `_` is increased by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` contains the new appended list of integers, `_` is increased by 1**
