According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i + 1][mask]` values are updated based on the loop logic, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are set based on the loop logic, so they do not need adjustment. For the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to 0.
State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]` values are updated based on the loop logic, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are set based on the loop logic, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
