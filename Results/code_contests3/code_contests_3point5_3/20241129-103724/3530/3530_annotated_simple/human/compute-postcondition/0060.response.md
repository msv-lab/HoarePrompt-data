Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
