Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The conditions state that `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. The new value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on these conditions. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *After all iterations of the loop dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the given conditions.
