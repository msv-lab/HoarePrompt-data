According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop, dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, and dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values.
State: **After all iterations of the loop dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
