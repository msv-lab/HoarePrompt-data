According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are all updated. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by taking its modulo with `MOD` and adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` if the condition is met.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, where `n` is at least 1**.
