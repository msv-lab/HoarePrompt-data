Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its final value modulo `MOD` by taking the modulo of its current value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`**
