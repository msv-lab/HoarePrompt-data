Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This operation involves bitwise XOR and left shift operations. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are used to calculate the new value. 
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the values in `dp[i + 1][mask]` are further updated based on the if condition, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than the current value`**
