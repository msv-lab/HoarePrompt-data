According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 because `n` is used to determine the range of the loop. Before the loop starts, the `dp[i + 1][mask]` values will be updated based on the loop logic. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following initial conditions need to be adjusted:
State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]` values are updated based on the loop logic, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `a` are set based on the loop logic, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**.
