Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic with `j` being 2 and `n` being greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the corresponding logic is executed. Furthermore, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.***
