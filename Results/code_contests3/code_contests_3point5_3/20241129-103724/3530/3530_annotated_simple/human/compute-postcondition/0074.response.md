Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The values in `dp[i][mask]` will be affected based on the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and the value of `MOD`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the values in dp[i + 1][mask] are further updated based on the if condition, for the loop to execute one more time j must be greater than the current value`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0.
