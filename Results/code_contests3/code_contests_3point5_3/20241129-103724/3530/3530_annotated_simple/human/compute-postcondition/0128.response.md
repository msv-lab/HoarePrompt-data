According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `mask` and `n`. If `mask` is less than `1 << n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is less than `1 << n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` will be updated, for the loop to execute another time `mask + 1` must be less than `1 << n`**
