According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value and `n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is being iterated over from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **For all `i` and `mask + 1` values in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, after executing the if statement, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its current value modulo `MOD`, where `n` is greater than 0, `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask + 1 & 1 << j`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1.**
