According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 but still less than `n`.
State: **`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, `j` is increased by 1 but less than `n`**
