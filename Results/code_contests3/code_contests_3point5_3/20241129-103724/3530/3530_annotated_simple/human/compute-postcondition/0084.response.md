Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `n` are adjusted based on loop conditions. The conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask + 1 & 1 << j` are satisfied. Additionally, after entering the if condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)`, the program state includes the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. 
Output State: **For the loop to execute the first time, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]` updated values based on loop conditions for all `i` and `mask + 1` values where mask + 1 is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1. `i` is adjusted based on loop conditions. `mask + 1` is adjusted based on loop conditions. `n` is greater than 0. `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask + 1 & 1 << j`. Additionally, after entering the if condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)`, the program state includes the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` and `dp[i][mask]` is updated.**
