Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are unknown, but after the operation, it will contain the remainder of the division by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0`**
