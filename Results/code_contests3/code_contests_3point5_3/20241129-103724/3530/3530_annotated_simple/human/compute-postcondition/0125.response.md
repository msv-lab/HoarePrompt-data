Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, so the output state is: `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the program executes the corresponding logic. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the program executes the corresponding logic. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`**
