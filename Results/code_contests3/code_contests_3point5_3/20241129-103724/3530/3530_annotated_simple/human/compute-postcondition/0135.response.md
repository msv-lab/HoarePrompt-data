Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The conditions for this update are that `mask` must be less than `1 << n`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j`. All other variables are updated in the process. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `mask` must be less than `1 << n`, where `n` is at least 1 and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated.**
