According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the program executes the corresponding logic**.
