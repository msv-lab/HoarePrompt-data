Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is determined by iterating through the possible values. Since the initial state values are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact final values of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the Output State is: *For all `i` and `mask + 1` values in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, after entering the if condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask + 1 & 1 << j` for all possible `j` values, `mask` is less than `1 << n*.
Output State: ***For all `i` and `mask + 1` values in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, after entering the if condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask + 1 & 1 << j` for all possible `j` values, `mask` is less than `1 << n***.
