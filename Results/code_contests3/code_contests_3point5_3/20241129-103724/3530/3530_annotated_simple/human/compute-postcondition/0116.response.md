Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1**
