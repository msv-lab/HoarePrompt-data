Example Answer:
The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` appends a list of integers converted from the input values split by space into the list `a`. The input values are separated by space and are converted to integers using the `int` function. 
Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop executes `n` times, and each time a list of integers is appended to list `a`.
Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values**
