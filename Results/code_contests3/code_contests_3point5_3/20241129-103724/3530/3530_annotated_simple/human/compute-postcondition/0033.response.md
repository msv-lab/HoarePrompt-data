Output State: **N is a positive integer, n is a valid positive integer, a is a list containing lists of integers, dp is a 2D list with updated values after all iterations of the loop, i is equal to n+1, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are still assigned the value 1, dp[0][(1 << n)] is still assigned the value 1, mask is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1.**
