Postcondition: ***`dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `mask + 1` must be less than `1 << n` where `n` is at least 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`.***
