Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is the position of the set bit in `mask`. The loop can execute again only if `mask + 1` is less than `1 << n`, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1. The values of `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, and `a` are updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `mask + 1` is less than `1 << n`, `n` is at least 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `mask + 1` is less than `1 << n`, `n` is at least 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
