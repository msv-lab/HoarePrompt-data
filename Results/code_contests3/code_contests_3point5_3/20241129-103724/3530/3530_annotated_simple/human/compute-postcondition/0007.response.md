According to the code, the loop will execute n times based on the variable `_`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to the current iteration number. So for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be increased by 1 and the total number of iterations should be less than or equal to `n`.
State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` contains the new appended list of integers, `_` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute another time `_` must be less than `n`**
