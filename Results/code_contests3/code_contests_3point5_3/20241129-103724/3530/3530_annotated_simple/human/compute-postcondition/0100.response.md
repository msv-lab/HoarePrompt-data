Example Answer:
After executing the code snippet `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`. Since no specific initial values are given for `dp[i][mask]`, the output state will simply be that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated modulo `MOD`**
