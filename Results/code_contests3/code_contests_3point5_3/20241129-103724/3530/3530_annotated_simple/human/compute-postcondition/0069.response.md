Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is the position of the set bit in the mask. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are known. After execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the addition. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0`**
