Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, n is a valid positive integer, a is a list containing lists of integers, dp is a 2D list with updated values after all iterations of the loop, i is 0, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are still assigned the value 1, dp[0][(1 << n)] is still assigned the value 1, mask is (1 << n), n is greater than or equal to 1, j is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j***
