Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated. `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is at least 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `j` is increased by 1 but less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with its value modulo MOD. All other variables retain their original values.***
