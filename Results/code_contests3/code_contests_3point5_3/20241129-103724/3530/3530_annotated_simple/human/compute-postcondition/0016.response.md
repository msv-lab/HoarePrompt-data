Output State: **N is a positive integer, `n` is a valid positive integer, `a` is a list containing lists of integers, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of size (1 << n) for each row in range n+1, `i` is (1 << n), dp[0][(1 << n)] is assigned the value 1. Now, after executing the code snippet, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1.**
