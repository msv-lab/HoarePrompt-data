Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD` of its current value. The variables `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. The values of `j` and `n` are also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`**
