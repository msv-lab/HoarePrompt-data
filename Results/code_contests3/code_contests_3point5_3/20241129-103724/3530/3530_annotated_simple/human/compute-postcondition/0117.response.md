Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its current value modulo MOD. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
