Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with MOD. This operation does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0**
