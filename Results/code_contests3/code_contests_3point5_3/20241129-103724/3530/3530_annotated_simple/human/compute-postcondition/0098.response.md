Postcondition: ***For all `i` and `mask + 1` values in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, after entering the if condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`. `n` is greater than 0, `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask + 1 & 1 << j` for all possible `j` values, `mask` is less than `1 << n`***
