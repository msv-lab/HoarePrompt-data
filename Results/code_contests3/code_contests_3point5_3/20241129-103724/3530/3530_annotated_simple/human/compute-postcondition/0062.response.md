Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask & 1 << j`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and now `dp[i][mask]` is modulo `MOD`***.
