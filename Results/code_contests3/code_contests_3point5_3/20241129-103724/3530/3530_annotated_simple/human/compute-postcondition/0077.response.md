Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `j` must be greater than the current value for the loop to execute. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are already updated based on the conditions in the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0**
