Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `j` is increased by 1, so the `j-th` bit of `mask` is toggled. The conditions specified in the initial state ensure that the operation can be performed. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, `j` is increased by 1 but less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `n` is at least 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, `j` is increased by 1 but less than `n`**
