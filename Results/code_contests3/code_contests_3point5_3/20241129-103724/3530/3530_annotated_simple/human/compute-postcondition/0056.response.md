Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so the specific calculation cannot be determined. The loop updates all `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions within the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
