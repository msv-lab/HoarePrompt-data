According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` will be updated, so they need to be adjusted to reflect the initial values. Additionally, for the loop to execute another time, `mask + 1` must be less than `1 << n`. Therefore, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask + 1`, `a` are updated, for the loop to execute another time `mask + 1` is less than `1 << n`, `n` is at least 1**
