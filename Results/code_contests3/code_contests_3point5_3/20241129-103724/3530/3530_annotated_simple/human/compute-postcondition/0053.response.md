Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0. In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the given conditions, where `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its value modulo MOD.**
