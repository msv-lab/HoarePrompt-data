According to the code snippet, the loop will execute for values of i ranging from 1 to n inclusive. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **N is a positive integer, `n` is a valid positive integer, `a` is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values for each iteration of the loop, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of size (1 << n) for each row in range n+1, `i` is (1 << n), dp[0][(1 << n)] is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is initialized to 1, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are assigned the value 1.**
