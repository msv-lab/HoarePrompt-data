According to the code, the loop can execute again if `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated. So for the loop to execute another time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i + 1][mask + 1]`, `dp[i + 2][mask + 1]`, `i`, `mask`, `a` are updated. For the loop to execute another time, `mask` must be less than `1 << n`, where `n` is at least 1 and `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated. Also, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`.**
