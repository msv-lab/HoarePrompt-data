Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is an empty list.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is an empty list**
