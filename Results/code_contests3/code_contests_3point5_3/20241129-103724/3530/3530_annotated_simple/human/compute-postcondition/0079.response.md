Postcondition: ***For the given `dp[i + 1][mask]` updated values based on the loop conditions for all `i` and `mask` values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the values in `dp[i + 1][mask]` are further updated based on the condition that `j` must be greater than the current value after the execution of the if statement.***
