According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a value less than `n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **For all `i` and `mask + 1` values in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its final value modulo `MOD`, where `n` is greater than 0, `a` satisfies the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`, and `mask + 1 & 1 << j` for all possible `j` values, `mask` is less than `1 << n`. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated modulo `MOD`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.**
