Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic. `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the program executes the corresponding logic. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.**
