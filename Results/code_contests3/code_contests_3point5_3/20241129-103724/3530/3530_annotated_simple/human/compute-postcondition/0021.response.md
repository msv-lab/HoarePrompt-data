Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, n is a valid positive integer, a is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values for each iteration of the loop, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of size (1 << n) for each row in range n+1, i is 1, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are assigned the value 1, dp[0][(1 << n)] is assigned the value 1, mask is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1. In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j.***
