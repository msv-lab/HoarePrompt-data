Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are involved in the calculation. As `j` is 1, `1 << j` is 2. If the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `j`th bit of `mask` is 1 holds true, then the calculation takes place. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, and the calculation described above is executed.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1][mask]`, `dp[i + 2][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, and `a` values are updated based on the loop logic, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, and the calculation described above is executed**
