According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over `j`, the next iteration will be for `j+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, dp[i][mask + 1] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
