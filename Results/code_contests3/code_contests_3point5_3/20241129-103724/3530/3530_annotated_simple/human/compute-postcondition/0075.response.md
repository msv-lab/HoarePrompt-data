Postcondition: ***dp[i + 1][mask] contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all i and mask values, where mask is in the range from 1 to 2^n - 1, n is greater than 0. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the values in dp[i + 1][mask] are further updated based on the if condition. For the loop to execute one more time, j must be greater than the current value.***
