Output State: **N is a positive integer, n is a valid positive integer, a is a list containing lists of integers, dp is a 2D list with updated values after all iterations of the loop, i is 0, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are still assigned the value 1, dp[0][(1 << n)] is still assigned the value 1, mask is (1 << n), n is greater than or equal to 1, j is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, after the execution of the if block, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD**
