Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask + 1]` contains the updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all `i` and `mask` values. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the updated value is taken modulo `MOD`.**
