You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, and a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1.**
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is a positive integer, a_{i,j} values are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is assigned the input value, `a` is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values for each iteration of the loop
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is a positive integer, `n` is a valid positive integer, `a` is a list containing lists of integers converted from input values for each iteration of the loop, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of size (1 << n) for each row in range n+1, `i` is (1 << n), dp[0][(1 << n)] is assigned the value 1. After executing the code snippet, all dp[0][i] for i ranging from 0 to (1 << n) are assigned the value 1.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `mask`, `n`, and `a` will be updated according to the loop logic. The loop will execute for `n` times, and `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` if `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. The updated values will be taken modulo `MOD`.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
