Correctness: **True**

The program reads an input ticket number, extracts the digits, and checks if the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description provided. The program handles all cases where the ticket number is a lucky number and checks the sum of the first half against the sum of the second half as required.
