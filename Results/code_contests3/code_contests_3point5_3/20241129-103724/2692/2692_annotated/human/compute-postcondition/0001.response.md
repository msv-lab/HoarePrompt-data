Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. Since `n` is a positive even integer between 2 and 50, the value of `n` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive even integer between 2 and 50 and the ticket number is an integer of length n.
Output State: **n is a positive even integer between 2 and 50 and the ticket number is an integer of length n**
