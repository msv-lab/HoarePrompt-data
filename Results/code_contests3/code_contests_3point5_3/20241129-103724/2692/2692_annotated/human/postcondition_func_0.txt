The function `func` reads an input ticket number, extracts the digits, and checks if the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for the ticket number. It does not explicitly return any value but prints the validation result based on the comparison of digit sums.
