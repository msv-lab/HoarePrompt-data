The function `func` reads an even integer `n` and a ticket number with `n` digits. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value, and the state after execution continues based on the sum comparison result.
