Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, the ticket number is an integer of length n, digits is a list of integers obtained by mapping the int function to the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. If the sum of the first half of the digits in the ticket number is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits in the ticket number, the program continues execution as normal. If not, the program prints 'NO'.***
