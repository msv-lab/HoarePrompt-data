Example Answer:
The code maps each character of the input string to an integer and creates a list of integers called `digits`. Since the input is stripped, it removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**
