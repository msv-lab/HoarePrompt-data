Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input and a list of digits. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function is expected to handle cases where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50.**
