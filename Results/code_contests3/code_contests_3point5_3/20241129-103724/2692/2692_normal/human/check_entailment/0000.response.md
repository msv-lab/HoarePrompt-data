Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an even integer `n` and a list of digits from the user input. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the logic as described in the problem. Therefore, the code is correct.
