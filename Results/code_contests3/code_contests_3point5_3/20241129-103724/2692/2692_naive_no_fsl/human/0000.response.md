Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the ticket number is a lucky number. The program only checks if the sum of digits in the first half is equal to the sum of digits in the second half, but it does not check if the ticket number is a lucky number or not. This is a requirement mentioned in the problem description.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
4747
```
The program should output "YES" because the ticket number is a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half (4+7) equals the sum of digits in the second half (4+7). However, the program will output "NO" because it only checks the sum of digits without verifying if the number is lucky.
