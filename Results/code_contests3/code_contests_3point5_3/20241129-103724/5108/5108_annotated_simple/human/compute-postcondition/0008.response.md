Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` will simply print 'YES' to the console. The variables `p`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is '1' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is '1' for the loop to execute one more time**
