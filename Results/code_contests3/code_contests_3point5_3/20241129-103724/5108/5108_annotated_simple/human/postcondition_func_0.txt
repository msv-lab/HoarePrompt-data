The function `func` reads a string `a` from user input, iterates over each character in the string, and if any character is 'H', 'Q', or '9', it prints 'YES' and assigns 'tstr123' to `a`. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. The functionality also ensures that the string `a` must contain characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusively.
