Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid Python function, the program will throw an error. Therefore, the output state is: p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive.
Output State: **p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive**
