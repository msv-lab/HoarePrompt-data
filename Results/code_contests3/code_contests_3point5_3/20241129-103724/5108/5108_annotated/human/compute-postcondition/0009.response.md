Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the string 'tstr123'. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], 'YES' is printed**
