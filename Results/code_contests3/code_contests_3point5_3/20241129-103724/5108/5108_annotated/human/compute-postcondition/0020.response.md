Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive. `a` is 'tstr123'. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', 'NO' is printed. If any character in `a` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], 'YES' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
