The function `func` reads input from the user, checks if any character in the input string is 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
