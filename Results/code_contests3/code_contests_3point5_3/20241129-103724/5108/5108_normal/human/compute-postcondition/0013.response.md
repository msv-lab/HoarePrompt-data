Example Answer: 
The code snippet simply prints 'YES' to the console. There are no changes to the initial state variables `p` and `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; remaining characters in `a`; `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; remaining characters in `a`; `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
