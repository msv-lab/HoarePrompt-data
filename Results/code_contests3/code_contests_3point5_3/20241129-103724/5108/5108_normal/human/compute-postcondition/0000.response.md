Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which reads a string input. The initial state specifies that `p` is a string, so the only change is the introduction of the new variable `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a string input.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a string input**
