Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is either 'tstr123' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is in the input string, or the original input string if none of 'H', 'Q', or '9' is in the input string. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', the state of the program variables remains as described***
