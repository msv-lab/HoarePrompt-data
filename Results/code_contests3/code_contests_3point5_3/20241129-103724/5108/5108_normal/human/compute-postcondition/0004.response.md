Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The values of the other variables (`p` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a non-empty string; `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'; 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a non-empty string; `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'; 'YES' is printed**
