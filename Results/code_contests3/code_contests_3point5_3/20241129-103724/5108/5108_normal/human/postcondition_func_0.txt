The function `func` reads a string input `p` and checks if it contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If it does, it prints 'YES' and assigns 'tstr123' to the variable `a`. If none of these characters are found in the input string, it prints 'NO'. The function does not have any specific output in the constraints provided.
