Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads a string input `p` and checks if it contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and assigns 'tstr123' to the variable `a`. If none of these characters are present in the input string, it prints 'NO'. The code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases provided. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
