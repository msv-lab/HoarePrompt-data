Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v` from its current value. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above and `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above and `res` is incremented by 1**
