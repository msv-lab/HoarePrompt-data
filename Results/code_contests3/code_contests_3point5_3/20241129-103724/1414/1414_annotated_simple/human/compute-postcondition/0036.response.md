Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`. It then iterates a loop based on the value of `a`, decrementing it according to certain conditions involving `b`, `k`, and `v`. The loop increments a counter `res` on each iteration. After the loop, it prints the final value of `res`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
