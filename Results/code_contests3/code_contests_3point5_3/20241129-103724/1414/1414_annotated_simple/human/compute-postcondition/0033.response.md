Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. After all iterations of the loop, `a` becomes less than or equal to 0, and `b` becomes 0. The final value of `res` depends on the number of times the loop executed and the conditions met during each iteration.**
