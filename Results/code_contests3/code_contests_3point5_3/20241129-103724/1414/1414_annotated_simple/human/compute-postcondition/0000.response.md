Example Answer:
k, a, b, v are assigned values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of k, a, b, v are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: k, a, b, v are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000.
Output State: **k, a, b, v are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000**
