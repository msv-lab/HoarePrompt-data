Example Answer:
`a` is updated by subtracting `k * v`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0, otherwise, `b` retains its value. The value of `res` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` have updated values, `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0, otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` have updated values, `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0, otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0**
