Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` have updated values. If `b >= k`, `b` becomes 0. Otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 0. Additionally, after the execution of the code snippet `b = b - (k - 1)`, the value of `b` is updated based on the formula.***
