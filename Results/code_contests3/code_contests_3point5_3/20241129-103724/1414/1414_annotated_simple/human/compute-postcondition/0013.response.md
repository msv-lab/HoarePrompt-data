Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 1. `b` is an integer less than `k`. If `b` > 0, then `a` is updated based on the formula provided. If `b` is not greater than 0, `k`, `a` are decreased by `v`, `b`, `v` remain unchanged, `res` is 1.***
