Output State: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` have updated values, `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0, otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0. After the execution of the code snippet `b = b - (k - 1)`, the value of `b` is updated based on the formula.
