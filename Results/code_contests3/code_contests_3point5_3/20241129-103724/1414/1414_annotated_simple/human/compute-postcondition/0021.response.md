Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `a - v`. The previous values of `a` and `v` are not provided, so the new value of `a` cannot be determined. The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `res` is incremented by 1**
