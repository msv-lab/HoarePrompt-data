The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0; otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `res` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` have updated values, `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` becomes 0. Otherwise, `b` retains its value. For the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0**
