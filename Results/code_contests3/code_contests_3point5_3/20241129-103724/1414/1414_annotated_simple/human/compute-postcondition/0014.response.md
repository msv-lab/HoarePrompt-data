Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated to `(previous value of a) - (k * v)`, `b` is updated to `(previous value of b) - (k - 1)`. If `b` is less than `k`, then based on the value of `b`, `a` is updated accordingly. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated based on the formula provided. If `b` is not greater than 0, `k`, `a` are decreased by `v`, `b`, `v` remain unchanged, and `res` is 1.***
