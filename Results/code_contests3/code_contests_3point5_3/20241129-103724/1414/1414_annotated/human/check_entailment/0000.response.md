Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description. It reads the input values and then enters a loop to distribute the nuts into boxes based on the conditions specified. The program ensures that the number of sections in each box does not exceed the maximum value `k` and that the number of nuts in each section does not exceed the capacity `v`. The loop continues until all nuts are distributed, and the final number of boxes used is printed, which aligns with the problem requirements. Hence, the program is correct.
