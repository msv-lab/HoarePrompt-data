Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user consisting of four integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` within specified constraints. It then enters a loop where it increments `res` by 1 for each iteration. Depending on the values of `b` and `k`, it adjusts the values of `a` and `b` accordingly. The loop continues until `a` becomes less than or equal to 0. The function does not return any value but prints the final value of `res`, which represents the number of iterations executed.**
