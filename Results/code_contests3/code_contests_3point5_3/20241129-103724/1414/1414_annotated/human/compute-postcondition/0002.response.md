According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `res` is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `a` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0**
