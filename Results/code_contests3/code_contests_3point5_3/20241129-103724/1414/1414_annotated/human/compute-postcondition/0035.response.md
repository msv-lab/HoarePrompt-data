The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the predefined integer variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, which satisfy the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. The function does not return any value, but it likely performs some operations or calculations based on the values of the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`.
