Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the result of `(b + 1) * v` from its current value. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the formula `a = a - (b + 1) * v`.
Output State: **`res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the formula `a = a - (b + 1) * v`**
