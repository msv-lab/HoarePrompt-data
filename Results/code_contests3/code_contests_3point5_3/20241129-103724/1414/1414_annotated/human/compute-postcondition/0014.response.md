Postcondition: ***`res` is 1, `a` is greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` is updated to a new value and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `b` is less than `k`, then based on the value of `b`, `a` is updated accordingly. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to the result of subtracting the product of `(b + 1) * v` from its previous value. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
