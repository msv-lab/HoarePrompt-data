Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`, as `b = b - (k - 1)`. The previous values of `b`, `k`, and `v` are unknown, so the output state is updated as follows:
Output State: **`res` is 2, `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`, `b` is updated by subtracting (k - 1)**
