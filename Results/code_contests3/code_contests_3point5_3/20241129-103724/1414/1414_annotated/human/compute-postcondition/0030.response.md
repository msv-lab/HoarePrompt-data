Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `v` from its previous value. The initial value of `a` is greater than 0, but the value of `v` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the final output state will be: `res` is 3, `a` is updated by subtracting `v`, where `v` is not specified.
Output State: **`res` is 3, `a` is updated by subtracting `v`, where `v` is not specified**
