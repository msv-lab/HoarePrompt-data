According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is 1, `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `a` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is 1, `a` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again `a` needs to be greater than 0**
