Example Answer:
`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned the values obtained by converting the input values to integers using `int(x) for x in raw_input().split()`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: k, a, b, and v are integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are integers within the specified ranges**
