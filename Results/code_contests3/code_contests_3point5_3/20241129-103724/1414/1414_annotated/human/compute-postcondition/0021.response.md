Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `v` from it. Since the initial state states that `a` is greater than 0, the specific value of `v` is not given, so the new value of `a` will be `a - v`. Therefore, the Output State is: res is 2, a is updated to a - v.
Output State: **res is 2, a is updated to a - v**
