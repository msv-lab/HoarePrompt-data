Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the new value of `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1**
