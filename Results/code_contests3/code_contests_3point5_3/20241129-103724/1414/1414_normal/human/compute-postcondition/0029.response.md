Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is incremented by 2 and for the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0; `a` is updated to a new integer value based on the calculation `a = a - (b + 1) * v`. `b` is assigned the value 0.**
