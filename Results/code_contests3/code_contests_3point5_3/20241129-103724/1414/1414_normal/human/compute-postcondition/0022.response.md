Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1. If b > 0, `k`, `a`, `b` is 0, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1. If b <= 0, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1, `a` has been decremented by a value between 1 and 1000.***
