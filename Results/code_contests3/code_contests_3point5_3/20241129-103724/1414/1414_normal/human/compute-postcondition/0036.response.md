Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` within specified constraints, performs calculations inside a while loop based on conditions involving these input values, increments a counter `res` based on the number of loop iterations, and finally prints the value of `res`. It updates `a`, `b`, and `v` based on certain conditions within the loop, but it does not return any value.**
