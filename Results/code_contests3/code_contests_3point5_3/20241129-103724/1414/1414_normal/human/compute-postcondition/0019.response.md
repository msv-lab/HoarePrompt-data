Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `a` minus `(b + 1) * v`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are unknown, but `res` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1**
