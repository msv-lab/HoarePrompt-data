Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a - v`, where `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers ranging from 1 to 1000. The decrement is by a value between 1 and 1000. The value of `res` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1, `a` has been decremented by a value between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1, `a` has been decremented by a value between 1 and 1000**
