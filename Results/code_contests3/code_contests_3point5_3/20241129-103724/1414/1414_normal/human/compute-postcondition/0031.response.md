Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is incremented by 2 and for the loop to execute again, `a` is greater than 0. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated to a new integer value based on the calculation `a = a - (b + 1) * v`, and `b` is assigned the value 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is updated to a new value after subtracting `v` from it.***
