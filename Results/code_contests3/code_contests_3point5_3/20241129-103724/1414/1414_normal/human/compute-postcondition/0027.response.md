Output State: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is incremented by 2, `a` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to a new value after subtracting k * v from its previous value; `b` is updated to a new value after subtracting (k - 1) from its previous value.
