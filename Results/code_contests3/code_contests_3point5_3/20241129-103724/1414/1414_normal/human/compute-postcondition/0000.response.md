Example Answer:
`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned values based on the input received after splitting it. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000**
