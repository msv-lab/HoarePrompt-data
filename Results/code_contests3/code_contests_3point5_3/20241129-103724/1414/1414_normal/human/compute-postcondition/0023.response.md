Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1. If b >= k, `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If b > 0 in the else part, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are set to 0, `v` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, v <= 1000; `res` has been incremented by 1. If b <= 0 in the else part, `a` is decremented by a value between 1 and 1000.***
