Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes needed to put all the nuts in boxes while satisfying the constraints provided in the problem description. It iterates through the nuts and calculates the number of boxes required based on the divisors and capacity of each section of the box. The logic within the while loop handles the distribution of nuts into boxes according to the given conditions. The program terminates when all the nuts have been put into boxes. 

For all the given examples, the program produces the correct output as per the problem description.
