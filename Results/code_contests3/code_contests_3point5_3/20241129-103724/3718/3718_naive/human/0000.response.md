Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the input city and flatland ring coordinates and radii. It considers all possible scenarios where the radar can be placed to detect the enemy's attack. The formula used to calculate the minimum detection radius is in line with the problem description. The program also formats the output to match the required precision. Overall, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
