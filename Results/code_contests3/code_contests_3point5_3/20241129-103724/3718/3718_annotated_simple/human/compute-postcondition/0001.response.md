The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, all of which are integers. After executing the function body, the program calculates the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points, and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points, and returns the Euclidean distance between them.**
