#State of the program right berfore the function call: 
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and it calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points.
