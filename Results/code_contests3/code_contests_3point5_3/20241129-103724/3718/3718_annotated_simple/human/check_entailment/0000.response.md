Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This is essential for determining the minimum detection radius of the radar as described in the problem. The program accurately computes the distance between the city and the flatland ring, which is necessary for finding the optimal location to place the radar. The program meets the requirements of the problem description and always provides the correct distance calculation, making it a valid solution for the given problem.
