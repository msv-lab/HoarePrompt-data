The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, y2, all of which are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| â‰¤ 104. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing two points in a plane and return the Euclidean distance between those two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points in a plane and returns the Euclidean distance between those two points.**
