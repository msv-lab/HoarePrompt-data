Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not solve the stated problem description. The problem description requires finding the minimum possible detection radius for a radar that can detect movements of both flatland rings. However, the annotated program simply calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
