Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the `func_1` function.
- It then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the distances from the cities and the flatland ring as described in the problem statement.
- The code uses conditional statements to handle different scenarios such as when the sum of the radii is less than the distance between the points or when the difference between the radii is greater than the distance.
- The output is formatted to display the minimum detection radius with 6 decimal places.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints confirm the correct functionality of the code.
