Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, and calculates the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) by finding the square root of the sum of squared differences. The function correctly handles cases where x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers within the range -104 to 104.**
