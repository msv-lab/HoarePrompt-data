The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, and y2, all of which are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| â‰¤ 104. After executing the function body, the program calculates the square root of the sum of the squared differences between x1 and x2, and y1 and y2. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, and return the square root of the sum of the squared differences between them.
