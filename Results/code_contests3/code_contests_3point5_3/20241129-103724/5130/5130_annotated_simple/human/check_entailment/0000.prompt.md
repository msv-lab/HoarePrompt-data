You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b1, b2, ..., bn, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position pi, and if bi equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.

Input

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b1, b2, ..., bn consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.

Output

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

Examples

Input

4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1


Output

2


Input

3
2 3 1
0 0 0


Output

1

Note

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    p = [(int(v) - 1) for v in raw_input().split()]
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    comps = [(0) for i in xrange(n)]
    col = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        if comps[i] == 0:
            col += 1
            comps[i] = col
            j = i
            while comps[p[j]] == 0:
                j = p[j]
                comps[j] = col
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `col` is equal to the number of unique elements in `p`, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents a unique component identified in the loop, all components have been assigned a unique identifier.
    print(0 if col == 1 else col) + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
