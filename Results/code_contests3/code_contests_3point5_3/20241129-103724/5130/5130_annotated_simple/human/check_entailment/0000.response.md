Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements. 

It achieves this by first identifying the unique components in the permutation p using a loop. Then, it checks if there is only one component (all skewers are in the same cycle) or if the sequence b has all zeros (no skewers are reversed). Based on these conditions, it calculates and prints the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly determines the minimum changes required for all skewers to visit each of 2n placements.
