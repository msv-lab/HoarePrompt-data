Example Answer:
The value of `col` is assigned to the element at index `i` in the list `comps`. Since `i` is 0 and `col` is 1, after execution, the element at index 0 in `comps` becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index 0 is 1, `col` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index 0 is 1, `col` is 1**
