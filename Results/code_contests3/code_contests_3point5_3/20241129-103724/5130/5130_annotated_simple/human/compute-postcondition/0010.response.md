According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index 0 is 1, `col` is 1, and `j` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `comps` list must be modified such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index 0 is 0, `col` is 1, `j` is 0**
