Output State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed plus 1, there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] == 0`, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is the new value after updating with `p[j']`, `col` is incremented by 1, there should be another index `k` such that `comps[p[k]] == 0`, `j` is updated to a new value after `p[j']`, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`.
