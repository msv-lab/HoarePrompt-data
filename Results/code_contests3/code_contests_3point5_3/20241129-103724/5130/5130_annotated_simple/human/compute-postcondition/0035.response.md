Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `j` is the last index accessed in the loop, there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] != 0` and `p[j]` is a valid index within the list.***
