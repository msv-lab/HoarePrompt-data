Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values to integers and stores them in variable `b`. The previous values of `n` and `p` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value, `b` is a list of integers from the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value, `b` is a list of integers from the input values**
