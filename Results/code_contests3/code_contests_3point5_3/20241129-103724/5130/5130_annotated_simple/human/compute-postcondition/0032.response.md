Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] != 0`, `p[j]` is a valid index within the list, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to the value at index `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value at index `p[j]`.**
