Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `j` is the last index accessed in the loop, there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] != 0`, if `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col` and `j` is set to 0.***
