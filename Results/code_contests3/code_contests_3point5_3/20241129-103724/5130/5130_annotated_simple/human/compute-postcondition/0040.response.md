According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, it is given that there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] != 0`, so for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed plus 1, `j` is the last index accessed in the loop, there exists a `j` such that `comps[p[j]] == 0`, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
