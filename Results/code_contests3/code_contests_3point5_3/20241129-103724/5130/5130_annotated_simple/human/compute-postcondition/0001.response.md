Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each element of the input values after splitting them. Since the input values are not known, the resulting list `p` will depend on the values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value**
