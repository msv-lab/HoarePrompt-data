Example Answer:
A list `comps` is created with `n` number of elements, each initialized to 0. The value of `n` is already known as an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers after subtracting 1 from each input value, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0**
