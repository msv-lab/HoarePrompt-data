Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` and `p` are known, so after execution, `j` will be updated based on the index `j` in list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers with comps[p[j]] = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated based on the index `j` in list `p`, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers with comps[p[j]] = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated based on the index `j` in list `p`, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
