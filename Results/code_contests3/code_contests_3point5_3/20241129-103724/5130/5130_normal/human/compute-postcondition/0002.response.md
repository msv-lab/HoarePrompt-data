Example Answer:
The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and maps it to the list `b`. The values of `n` and `p` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input**
