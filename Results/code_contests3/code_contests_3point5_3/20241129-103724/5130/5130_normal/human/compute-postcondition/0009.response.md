Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list where comps[i] is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list where comps[i] is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is 0**
