Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list where comps[i] is equal to `col` which is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]` such that the new value of `j` is the last element of the permutation `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` after all the iterations have executed.
