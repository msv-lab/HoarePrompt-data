Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the last element of `p`, `col` is incremented by the number of unique elements in `comps`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the updated value of `col` for all elements in comps. For the loop to execute another time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by the number of unique elements in `comps`, `comps[i]` is equal to the final updated `col`, and `j` is equal to the final value after all iterations of the loop.***
