Example Answer: 
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, `comps[j]` will be updated with the new value of `col`. The values of `n`, `col`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`**
