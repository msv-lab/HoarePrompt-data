Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `col` is incremented by 1. After execution, `comps[j]` is equal to the updated `col`. The states of `n`, `p`, and `j` are not affected. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `comps[j]` is equal to the updated `col`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `comps[j]` is equal to the updated `col`**
