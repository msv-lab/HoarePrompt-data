Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, `i` is 1, so after execution, `j` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
