Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list of zeros with a length of `n`, `col` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute. When entering the if condition (comps[i] == 0), the value of comps at index i is equal to 0***
