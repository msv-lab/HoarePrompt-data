Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. p is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 1 and n. b is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones.**
