Example Answer:
`comps` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n`, where each element is represented by `(0)`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list of zeros with a length of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list of zeros with a length of `n`**
