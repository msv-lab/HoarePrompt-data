Example Answer:
The value of `j` is updated to `p[j]`. The previous values of `j` and `p` are given. After updating `j`, the loop will execute again only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `comps[j]` is equal to the updated `col`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `comps[j]` is equal to the updated `col`**.
