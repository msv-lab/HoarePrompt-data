Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` and `p[j]` can vary based on the initial state, but `j` will be updated to the value of `p[j]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0**
