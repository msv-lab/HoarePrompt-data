Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of integers with all elements set to 0, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i`, `col` is incremented by the number of unique elements in `comps`, `comps[j]` is assigned the updated value of `col` for all elements in comps, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`.**
