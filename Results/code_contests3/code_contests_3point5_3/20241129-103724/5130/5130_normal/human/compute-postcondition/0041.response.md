Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` will be updated according to the value of `p` at index `j`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated `col`, `j` is updated based on `p[j]`**
