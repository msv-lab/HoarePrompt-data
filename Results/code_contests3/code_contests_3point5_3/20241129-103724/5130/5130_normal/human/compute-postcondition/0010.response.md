According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `comps[p[j]]` needs to be equal to 0 for the loop to execute. So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones based on user input, `comps` is a list where comps[i] is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then comps[p[j]] is 0**
