Correctness: **False**

The code does not seem to follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code should print either 0 or the total number of unique color groups based on specific conditions. However, the code does not explicitly return a value, which is a contradiction to the problem description. This discrepancy indicates that the code may not be correct in all scenarios. Further analysis is needed to determine the exact cases where the code fails to meet the requirements.
