Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not seem to correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation p and the sequence b. The logic in the program does not align with the problem description. The output of the program does not match the expected output for the given examples.

For example, let's consider the following input:
```
Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Expected Output
1

Actual Output
2
```

Therefore, based on the discrepancy in the output for the given example, the correctness of the program is "False".
