Correctness: False

The program does not correctly handle the requirement of changing the permutation and sequence b to ensure that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. The program only calculates the number of connected components in the permutation graph and adds 1 based on the sum of elements in sequence b, which may not necessarily ensure that every skewer visits each placement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
0 0 0 0
```
In this case, the program will output 1, but the correct output should be 3. So, the program does not always produce the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed to satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
