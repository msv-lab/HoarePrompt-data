Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j']`, the `i-th` element of `comps` is assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j']`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j']`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
