Functionality: **The function `func` reads inputs for `n`, `p`, and `b` according to the given constraints. It then iterates through the elements of `p` and assigns components based on certain conditions. After the loop, it prints a value based on the calculated `col` and the sum of elements in `b`. The function does not return any value but operates on the predefined inputs.**
