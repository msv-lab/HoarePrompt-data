Postcondition: ***'n' is an input integer, 'p' is a list containing 'n' elements, 'b' is a map object created by applying the 'int' function to each element obtained by splitting the input using 'raw_input().split()', 'comps' is a list of 'n' elements all assigned the value of 'col', 'col' is 1, 'j' is updated to the value of 'p[j]', 'i-th' element of 'comps' is assigned the value of 'col', 'comps' contains the values of 'col' assigned in the loop, 'j' is updated to the last value of 'p[j]' after the loop finishes, if 'comps[i] == 0', then 'col' is updated to 1, 'j' is updated to 'p[j]', and the 'i-th' element of 'comps' is assigned the value of 'col'***
