Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the element at index `i` in `comps` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to the value at index `j` in list `p`, the element at index `j` in `comps` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
