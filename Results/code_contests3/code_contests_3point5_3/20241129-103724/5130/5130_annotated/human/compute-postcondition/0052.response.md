Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col` + 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]` after the loop finishes, `col` is incremented by 1, the value of `col` is printed if it is not 1, then either 0 or 1 is added based on the sum of `b`.**
