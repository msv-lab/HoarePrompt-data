Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, `j` is equal to the value at index `j` in list `p`, the element at index `j` in `comps` is equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute again the element at index `p[j]` in `comps` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
