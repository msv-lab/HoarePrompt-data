According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
- `p` should contain at least `n` elements.
- `b` should be a map object obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`.
- `comps` should be a list of `n` zeros.
- `col` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
