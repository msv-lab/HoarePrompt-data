Example Answer:
`col` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing elements that are one less than the input integers, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of n zeros, `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing elements that are one less than the input integers, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of n zeros, `col` is 0**
