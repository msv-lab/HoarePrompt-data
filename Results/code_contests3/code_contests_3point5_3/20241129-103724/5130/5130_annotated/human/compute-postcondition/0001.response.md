Example Answer:
The list comprehension `[(int(v) - 1) for v in raw_input().split()]` creates a new list `p` where each element is one less than the input integers after splitting the input. Since the initial state includes only `n` as an input integer, the value of `n` is used in the list comprehension. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing elements that are one less than the input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing elements that are one less than the input integers**
