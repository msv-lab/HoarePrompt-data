According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing `n` elements, `b` is a map object created by applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`, `comps` is a list of `n` elements all assigned the value of `col`, `col` is 0, `j` is updated to the last value assigned to it by the loop, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**.
