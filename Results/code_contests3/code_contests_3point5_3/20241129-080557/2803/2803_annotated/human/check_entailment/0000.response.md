Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two integers n and k from the input and then calculates the largest possible xor-sum based on the given logic. It calculates the xor-sum by using bitwise operations and returns the expected result as described in the problem description. The program handles all cases where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and provides the correct output.
