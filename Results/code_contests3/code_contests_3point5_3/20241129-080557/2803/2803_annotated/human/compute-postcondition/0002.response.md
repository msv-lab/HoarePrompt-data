The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses the values of two predefined integers n and k, which satisfy the constraints stated above. The function then returns a value based on some internal logic. Unfortunately, without further information on the internal workings of the function, I am unable to provide a specific description of its functionality.
