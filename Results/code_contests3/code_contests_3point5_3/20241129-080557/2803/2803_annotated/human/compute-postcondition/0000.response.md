Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the values are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
