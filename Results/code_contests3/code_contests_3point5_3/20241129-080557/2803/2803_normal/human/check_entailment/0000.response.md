Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not match the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints suggest that if `k` is equal to 1, the code should return `n`, otherwise, it should perform a bitwise operation on `n` and return the result. However, the actual code logic does not seem to handle this correctly. For example, if we take the input (4, 3) as mentioned in the problem description, the code will output 3 instead of the correct answer, which is 7. Therefore, the code is not correct for all potential cases.
