The function `func` takes two integer inputs `n` and `k` and calculates the result based on the conditions stated in the code. It uses bitwise operations to calculate the result and prints the output. If `k` is equal to 1, it returns `n`; otherwise, it performs a bitwise operation on `n` and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return any value.
