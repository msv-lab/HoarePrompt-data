Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then computes and prints a value based on the condition: if k - 1 is true, it prints the result of 2 raised to the length of the binary representation of n minus 1; otherwise, it prints n. The function does not have a return value.**
