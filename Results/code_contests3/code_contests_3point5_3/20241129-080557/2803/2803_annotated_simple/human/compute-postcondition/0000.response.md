Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by splitting the input string and converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `k` are unknown but they are integers within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
