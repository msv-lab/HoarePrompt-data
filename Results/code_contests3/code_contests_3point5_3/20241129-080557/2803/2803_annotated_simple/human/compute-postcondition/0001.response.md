Example Answer:
The code calculates 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 1 if `k - 1` is true, otherwise it simply returns `n`. Since `n` and `k` are given to be integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18, the output will be based on the conditions. If `k - 1` is true, then the output will be `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, otherwise the output will be `n`.
