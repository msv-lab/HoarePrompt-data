Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain based on the given input values n and k. It follows the logic described in the problem statement where it calculates the xor-sum by using the formula 2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n. Additionally, the program handles the edge case where k equals 1, as mentioned in the problem description. The program works correctly for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
