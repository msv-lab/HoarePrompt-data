Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain by following the problem description. It first reads the input values of n and k, then calculates the xor-sum based on the number of bits required to represent n. The formula used in the program is valid for determining the largest xor-sum when the number of candies Grisha can take is limited to k. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
