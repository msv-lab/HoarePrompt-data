According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input from the user. So, for the loop to execute, the input should not be empty. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0, which does not necessarily impact the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to the input from the user is not empty.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the input from the user is not empty**
