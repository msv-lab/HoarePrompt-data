Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the input value is '1'. After execution, if the input value is '1', then `pa` will be incremented by 1, otherwise, `pa` will remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same.
Output State: **`pa` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same**
