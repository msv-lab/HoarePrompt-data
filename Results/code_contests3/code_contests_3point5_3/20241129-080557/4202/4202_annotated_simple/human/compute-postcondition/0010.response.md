Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The initial value of `pb` is 0, and it will be incremented by 1 for each '1' character encountered in the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input, `pb` is the total number of '1' characters encountered during the execution.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input, `pb` is the total number of '1' characters encountered during the execution.**
