Example Answer: 
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **a and b are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0**
