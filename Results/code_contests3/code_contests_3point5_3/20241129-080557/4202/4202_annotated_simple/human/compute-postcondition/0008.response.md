Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value 0. The value of `pb` is now 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input, `pb` is 0**
