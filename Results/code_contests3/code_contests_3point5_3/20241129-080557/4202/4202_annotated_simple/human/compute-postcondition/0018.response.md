Functionality: **The function `func` processes two input strings `a` and `b`, which consist of only "0" and "1" characters and have lengths between 1 and 1000. It calculates the total number of '1' characters in each string, stores them in variables `pa` and `pb`, and then prints 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
