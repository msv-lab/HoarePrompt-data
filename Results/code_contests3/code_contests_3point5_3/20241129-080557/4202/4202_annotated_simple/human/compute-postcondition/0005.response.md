According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is '1', `pa` is incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the input value is '1'. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be '1' again.
State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the input value is '1'**
