Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the total number of '1' characters in both strings `a` and `b`, and then compares them. If the total number of '1' characters in `a` is greater than or equal to the total number of '1' characters in `b`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic is in line with the problem description, where the goal is to determine if it is possible to turn string `a` into string `b` based on the number of '1' characters in each string. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
