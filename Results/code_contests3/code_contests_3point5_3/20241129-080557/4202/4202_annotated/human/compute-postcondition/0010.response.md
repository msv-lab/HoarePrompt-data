Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The initial value of `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `a`, and the initial value of `pb` is 0. After the execution, the value of `pb` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of '1' in string `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `a`, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `a`, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `b`**
