Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the next character from the input is '1'. The value of `i` is the next character from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which is not given. Therefore, if the next character from the input is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1, otherwise `pa` remains the same. The lengths of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is either 0 or 1**
