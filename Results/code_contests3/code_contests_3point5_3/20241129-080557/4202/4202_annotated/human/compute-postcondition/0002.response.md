Example Answer: 
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state specifies that `pa` is 0 and `i` is the first character from the input. Therefore, if the first character of the input is '1', then `pa` will be incremented to 1. The lengths of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character from the input provided by `raw_input()`**
