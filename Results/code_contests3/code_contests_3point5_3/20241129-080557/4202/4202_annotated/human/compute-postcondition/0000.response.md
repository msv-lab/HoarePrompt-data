Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **a and b are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0**
