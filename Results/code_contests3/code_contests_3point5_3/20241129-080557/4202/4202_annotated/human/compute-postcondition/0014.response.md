Example Answer:
`pb` is increased by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state mentions that `pb` is already the number of occurrences of '1' in string `b` increased by 1. Therefore, after execution, `pb` will remain the same as the initial value and will not change. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in string `a`, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in string `b` increased by 1, and there are more characters left in the input strings `a` and `b` to process**
