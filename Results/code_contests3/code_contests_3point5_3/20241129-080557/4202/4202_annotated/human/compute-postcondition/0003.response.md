According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input provided by `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the last character processed from the input. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more character left in the input.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next character from the input provided by `raw_input()`**
