According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed some characters from the input strings `a` and `b`. To execute the loop one more time, there must be more characters left in the input strings to process.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `a`, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string `b` and there are more characters left in the input strings `a` and `b` to process**
