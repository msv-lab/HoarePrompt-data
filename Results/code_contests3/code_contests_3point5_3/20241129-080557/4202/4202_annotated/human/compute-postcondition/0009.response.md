According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one character in the input string. Before the loop starts, `a` and `b` are strings containing only "0" and "1", so `a` and `b` meet the requirement for the loop to execute. The variables `pa` and `pb` are described but not used in the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is 0**
