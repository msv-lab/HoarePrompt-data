Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the next character from the input is '1'. The initial state of `pa` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is the next character from the input. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `pa` depends on the value of `i` and the previous value of `pa`. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next character from the input provided by `raw_input()`, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the next character from the input is '1'**
