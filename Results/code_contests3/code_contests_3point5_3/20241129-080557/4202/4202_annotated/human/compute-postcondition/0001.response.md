According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input provided by `raw_input()`. Since the input is not specified, we need to assume that there is at least one character. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0, and `i` is the first character from the input provided by `raw_input()`.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0, `i` is the first character from the input provided by `raw_input()`**
