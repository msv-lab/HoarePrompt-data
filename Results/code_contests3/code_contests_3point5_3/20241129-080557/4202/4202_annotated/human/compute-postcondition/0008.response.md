Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is 0**
