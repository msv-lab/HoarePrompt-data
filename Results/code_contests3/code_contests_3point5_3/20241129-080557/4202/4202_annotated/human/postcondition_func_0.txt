The function `func` processes two input strings `a` and `b`, which consist of only '0's and '1's and have lengths between 1 and 1000. It calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in each string, stores them in variables `pa` and `pb`, and then prints 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, it directly interacts with the input strings `a` and `b`.
