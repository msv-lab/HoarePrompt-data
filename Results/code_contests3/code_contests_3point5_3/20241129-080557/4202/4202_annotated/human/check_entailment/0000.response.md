Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes two input strings `a` and `b` consisting of only '0's and '1's and calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in each string. Then, it compares the number of occurrences and prints 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
