According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string. If there are still characters left in the input string, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the input string. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be characters left in the input string.
State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the remaining input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string**
