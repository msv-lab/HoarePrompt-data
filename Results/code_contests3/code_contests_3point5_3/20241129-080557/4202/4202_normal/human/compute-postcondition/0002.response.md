Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state of `pa` is 0. Since the initial state of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `pa` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'**
