Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state has `pa` as the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string, and `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string. After execution, `pb` will be incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the remaining input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the remaining input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string**
