According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. If there is still input to be processed, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to analyze the next input value.
State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'**
