Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The initial state is `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0. After execution, `pb` will be incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the input string.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the input string**
