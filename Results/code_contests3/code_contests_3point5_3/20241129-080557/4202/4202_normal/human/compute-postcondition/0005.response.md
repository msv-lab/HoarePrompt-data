According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user through raw_input(). If there are more characters in the input, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in the input.
State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'** and **for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in the input**.
