Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value 0. The value of `pa` which is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0**
