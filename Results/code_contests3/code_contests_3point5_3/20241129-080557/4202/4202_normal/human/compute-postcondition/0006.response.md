Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. Since the value of `i` is not given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pa` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is either incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'**
