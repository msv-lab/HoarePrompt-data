Example Answer:
The code prints 'YES' if the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string is greater than or equal to itself (`pa >= pb`) and 'NO' otherwise. Since `pb` is equal to `pa`, the condition `pa >= pb` will always be true. Therefore, the output will always be 'YES'.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is equal to `pa`, the output is always 'YES'**
