According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters left in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the remaining input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the input string.
State: **`pa` is the number of times the character '1' appears in the remaining input string, `pb` is incremented by the number of times '1' appears in the remaining input string, for the loop to execute one more time there are more characters left in the input string**
