According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one character in the input provided by the user. So, before the loop starts, `pa` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `pa` is 0 and there is at least one character in the input for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time there is at least one character in the input**
