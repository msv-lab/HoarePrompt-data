Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code iterates over the two input strings `a` and `b`, counting the occurrences of the character '1' in each string. It then compares the counts and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in string `a` is greater than or equal to the count in string `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. 
The code logic aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines if it is possible to turn string `a` into string `b` based on the counts of '1's in each string. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided. Therefore, the code is correct.
