Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of '1's in both strings 'a' and 'b', and then compares them to determine if it is possible to turn 'a' into 'b'. The comparison logic is also correct, as it checks if the number of '1's in 'a' is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in 'b', which is a valid condition for the transformation to be possible. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for each case.
