Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of '1's in both strings 'a' and 'b' and compares them. If the number of '1's in 'a' is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in 'b', then it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This logic is in line with the problem description and covers all potential cases. The program handles the parity operations and removal of the first character of 'a' correctly to determine if it is possible to turn 'a' into 'b'. For all the given examples, the program produces the correct output.
