The function `func` reads two input integers `a` and `b`, calculates the number of digits in `a`, and then performs a series of operations involving the digits of `a` and `b` without returning any value directly. The final result of the operations is printed as `ans`. However, the specific operation details based on Stepan's integer and `m` are not clearly defined in the code or the annotations.
