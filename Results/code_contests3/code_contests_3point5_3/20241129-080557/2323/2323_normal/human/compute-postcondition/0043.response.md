Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is updated, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a` decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a` after the current iteration, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 0. If `a` modulo 10 is not equal to 0, then `a` is updated to the integer division of `a` by 10 and `h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10. Otherwise, `a` is updated and `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a` after the current iteration.***
