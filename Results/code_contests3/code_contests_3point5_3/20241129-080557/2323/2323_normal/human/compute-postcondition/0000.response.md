Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the output state is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, and m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is an input integer.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, and m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is an input integer**
