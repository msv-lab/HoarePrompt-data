Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1, so if the initial value of `c` is 2, after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 3, for the loop to execute again `copya` is a non-zero integer and `copya` is updated to its value divided by 10.
