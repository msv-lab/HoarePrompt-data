Example Answer:
Initially, Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is the updated value after dividing by 10, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a` decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a` after dividing by 10.

The code snippet `a = 10 ** c * h + a` updates the value of `a` based on the formula provided. The new value of `a` is calculated by multiplying `10` raised to the power of `c` with `h` and adding the initial value of `a`.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is the updated value after dividing by 10, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a` decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a` after dividing by 10.**
