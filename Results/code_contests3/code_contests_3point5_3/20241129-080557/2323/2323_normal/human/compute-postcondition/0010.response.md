According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. 
State: **Output State: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 2, for the loop to execute again `copya` is a non-zero integer**
