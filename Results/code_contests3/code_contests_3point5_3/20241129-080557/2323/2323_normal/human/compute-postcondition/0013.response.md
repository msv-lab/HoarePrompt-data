The loop calculates the number of digits in the input integer `a` and stores it in `c`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero, dividing `copya` by 10 each iteration. Once `copya` becomes zero, the loop will terminate. 
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0**
