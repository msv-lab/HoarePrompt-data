Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0. The last digit of `a` is 0***
