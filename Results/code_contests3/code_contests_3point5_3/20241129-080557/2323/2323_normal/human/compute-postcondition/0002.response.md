Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0**
