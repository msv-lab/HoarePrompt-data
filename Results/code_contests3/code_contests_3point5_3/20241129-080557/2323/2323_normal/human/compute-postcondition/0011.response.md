Example Answer:
`copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `copya` is divisible by 10, after execution, `copya` will be updated to its value divided by 10. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 2, for the loop to execute again `copya` is a non-zero integer and `copya` is updated to its value divided by 10.
