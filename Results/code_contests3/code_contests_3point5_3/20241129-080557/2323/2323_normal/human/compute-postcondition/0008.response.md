Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10 on its previous value. As `copya` is the result of `a` divided by 10, it will keep reducing by a factor of 10 in each iteration. The loop will continue to execute until `copya` reaches 0. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 1, `copya` is the result of a divided by 10 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 1, `copya` is the result of a divided by 10 for the loop to execute again.**
