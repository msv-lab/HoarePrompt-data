Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The value of `a` and `b` are given as inputs, and `a` is an input integer. `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, which is not used in this calculation. `copya` is 0 and is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`**
