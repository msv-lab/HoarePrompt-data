Example Answer:
The last digit of the updated value of `a` after the current iteration is calculated by taking the modulo of `a` with 10. Therefore, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is the updated value after the current iteration, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a` decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a` after the current iteration. If `a` modulo 10 is not 0, the loop continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the loop continues with `a` value after dividing by 10.**
