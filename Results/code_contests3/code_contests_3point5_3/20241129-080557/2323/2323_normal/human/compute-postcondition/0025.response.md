Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `a` is the updated value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, for the loop to execute, the first time `c` is greater than 0, and `h` is the last digit of the updated value of `a`. If `a` modulo 10 is not 0, the loop continues with updated values. Otherwise, the loop continues with `a` value after dividing by 10.***
