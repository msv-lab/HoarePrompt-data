According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the result of `a` divided by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` should not be zero, which means `a` should be divisible by 10. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, m is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, a is an input integer (divisible by 10), b is an input integer, c is 1, copya is the result of a divided by 10 for the loop to execute again**
