The function `func` takes no parameters and reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then calculates the number of digits in `a` and computes the minimum remainder of `a` divided by `b` after certain modifications to the digits of `a`. The final result is printed as the output. The function processes Stepan's integer and number `m`, where `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8. The specific details of how `a` is manipulated based on the description are unclear.
