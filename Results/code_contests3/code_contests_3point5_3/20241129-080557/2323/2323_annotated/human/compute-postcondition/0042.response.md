Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by multiplying 10 to the power of `c` and then adding the last digit of the updated `a`. The value of `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` represents the last digit of the updated `a`. Since the initial state of `a` has been updated, we can calculate the result accordingly.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
