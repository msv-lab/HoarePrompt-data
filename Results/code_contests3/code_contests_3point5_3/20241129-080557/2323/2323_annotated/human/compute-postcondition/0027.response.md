Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` when divided by 10. The previous values of `a` and `h` are unknown, so the output state is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding 10, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding 10, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
