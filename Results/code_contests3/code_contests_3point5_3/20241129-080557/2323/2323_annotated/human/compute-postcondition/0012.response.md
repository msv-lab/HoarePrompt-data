Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
