Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10. The value of `a` may be updated by adding 10, so `h` can be any value between 0 and 9. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding 10, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is a single digit integer between 0 and 9**
