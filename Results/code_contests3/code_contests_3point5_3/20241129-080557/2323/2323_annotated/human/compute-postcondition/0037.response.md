Example Answer:
`a` is updated by floor dividing it by 10. The last digit of `a` is stored in `h`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
