Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The variables `m`, `c`, and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
