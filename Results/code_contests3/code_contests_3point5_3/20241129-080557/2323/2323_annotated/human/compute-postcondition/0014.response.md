Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The variables `Stepan's integer`, `m`, `c`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`**
