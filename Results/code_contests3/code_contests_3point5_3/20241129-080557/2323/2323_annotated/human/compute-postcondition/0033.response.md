Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by multiplying 10 to the power of `c` with `h`, then adding the previous value of `a`. The length of Stepan's integer remains the same, `m` is not affected, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is updated to a single digit integer between 0 and 9. 
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is updated by dividing it by 10, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is a single digit integer between 0 and 9**
