According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Stepan's integer` is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than `i`.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding 10, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be greater than `i`**
