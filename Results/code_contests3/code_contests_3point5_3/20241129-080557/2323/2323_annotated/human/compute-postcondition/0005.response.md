Example Answer: 
`copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 using integer division. The value of `a` can be any positive integer, so after execution, `copya` will be the result of `a` divided by 10. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 0, copya is assigned the result of `a` divided by 10.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 0, copya is assigned the result of `a` divided by 10**
