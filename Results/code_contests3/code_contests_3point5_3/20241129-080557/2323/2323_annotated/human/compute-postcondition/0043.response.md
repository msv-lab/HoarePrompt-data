Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated according to the provided formula, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`. If `a` % 10 != 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Otherwise, Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.***
