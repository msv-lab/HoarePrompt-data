Example Answer:
The updated `a` is calculated as 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`, and then added to the previous value of `a`. The value of `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`. The length of Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer has a positive integer length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated according to the provided formula, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer has a positive integer length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated according to the provided formula, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
