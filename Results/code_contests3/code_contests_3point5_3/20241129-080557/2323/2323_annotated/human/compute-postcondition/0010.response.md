According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be non-zero at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `copya` should be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 2, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10 and `copya` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again**
