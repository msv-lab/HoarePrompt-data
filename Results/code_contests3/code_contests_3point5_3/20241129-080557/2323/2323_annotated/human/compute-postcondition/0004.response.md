According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is a non-zero value. Therefore, right before the loop, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 0, copya is assigned the value of a.**
