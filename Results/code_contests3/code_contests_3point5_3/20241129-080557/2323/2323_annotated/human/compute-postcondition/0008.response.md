Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division with 10. If `a` is 123, then after the execution of the code, `copya` becomes 12. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 1, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 1, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10**
