Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8. If `a` % 10 != 0, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`. If `a` % 10 == 0, `a` is updated by dividing it by 10, `c` must be greater than `i`, and `h` is a single digit integer between 0 and 9.***
