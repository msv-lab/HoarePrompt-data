Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` may be updated by adding `10 ** c * h + a` or `10 ** c * h + a`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the result of the updated `a` modulo `b` and the current `ans`, `c` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `h` is the remainder or the result of `a` modulo 10, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a` or `10 ** c * h + a`.***
