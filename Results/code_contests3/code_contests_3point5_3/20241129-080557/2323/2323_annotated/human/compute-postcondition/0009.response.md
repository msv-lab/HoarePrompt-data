Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is 2, `copya` is updated after integer division by 10.
