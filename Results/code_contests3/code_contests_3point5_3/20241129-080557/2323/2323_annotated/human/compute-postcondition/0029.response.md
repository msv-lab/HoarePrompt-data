Example Answer:
`a` is updated by adding 10 to the previous value of `a` and then assigning it the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The loop will execute one more time if `c` is greater than `i`. The last digit of the updated `a` is stored in `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` has been updated, `c` must be greater than `i`, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
