Example Answer:
a is assigned the value of int(input()), where input accepts an input and int converts it to an integer. Since no further operations are performed on the variable a, the output state is:
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The integer does not contain leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. a is an input integer.**
