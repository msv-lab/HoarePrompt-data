According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `a` % 10 != 0, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value of the previous `ans` and the remainder of the updated `a` divided by `b`.
- `h` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, if `a` % 10 == 0, `a` is assigned to Stepan's integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not 0.
- `h` is the last digit of `a`.
- `a` is now calculated based on the conditions mentioned.

State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, for the loop to execute another time conditions mentioned above must be satisfied.**
