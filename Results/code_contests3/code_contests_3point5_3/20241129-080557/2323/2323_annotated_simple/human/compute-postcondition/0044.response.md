Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers. The loop will execute `c` times, and after all iterations, `ans` will contain the minimum remainder of the divisions of `a` by `b`. The values of `a`, `h`, and `c` will be updated throughout the loop based on the conditions provided.**
