Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of the updated value of `a` divided by `b`. The previous value of `a` is not provided, but it is known that `a` is updated to the integer division of the previous value of `a` by 10. The remainder of the previous value of `a` divided by `b` is not 0, so `a` is modified to 10 and the loop will execute one more time. The last digit of the previous value of `a` is `h`, and after updating `a` to 10, `h` becomes the last digit of 10, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated to the minimum value of the previous `ans` and the remainder of the updated `a` divided by `b`, `h` is 0.
Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value of the previous `ans` and the remainder of the updated `a` divided by `b`, `h` is 0**
