Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` and `b` is an input integer. If the remainder of `a` divided by 10 is not 0, then the loop executes the first time with `ans` being the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The last digit of `a` is stored in `h`, `a` is updated to the integer division of `a` by 10, and then `a` is modified to `10 ** c * h + a`. If the remainder of `a` divided by 10 is 0, `a` is divided by 10, and `h` is set to 0. After executing `a = 10 ** c * h + a`, the new value of `a` is updated.***
