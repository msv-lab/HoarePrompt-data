Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers. If `a` % 10 != 0, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value of the previous `ans` and the remainder of the updated `a` divided by `b`, `h` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is assigned to Stepan's integer, `b` is an input integer, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is now calculated based on the conditions mentioned.***
