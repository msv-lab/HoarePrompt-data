Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is not specified, and `m` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer**
