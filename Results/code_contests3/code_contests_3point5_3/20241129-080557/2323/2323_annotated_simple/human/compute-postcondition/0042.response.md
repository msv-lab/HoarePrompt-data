Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by multiplying 10 raised to the power of `c` with `h` and adding the previous value of `a`. The value of `h` is the new remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the new remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the new remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10**
