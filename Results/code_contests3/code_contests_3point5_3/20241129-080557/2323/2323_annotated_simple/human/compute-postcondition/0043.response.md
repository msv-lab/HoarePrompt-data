Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers. If `a` % 10 != 0, `h` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10, and `a` is recalculated based on the updated values of `c` and `h`. If `a` % 10 == 0, `h` is the new remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10.***
