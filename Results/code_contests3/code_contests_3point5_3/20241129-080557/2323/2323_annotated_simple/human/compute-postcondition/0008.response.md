Example Answer:
`copya` is reassigned the value of `copya` divided by 10. Since `copya` was initially assigned the value of `a` divided by 10, this operation essentially divides `a` by 100. The value of `a` is unknown but it is a non-zero value, so `copya` becomes a new value derived from `a` divided by 100. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown non-zero value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown non-zero value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100**
