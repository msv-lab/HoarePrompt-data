Example Answer:
The variable `h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` after the update, which is the remainder of `a` divided by 10. The value of `a` is modified to 10, which means `a` is now 10. The other initial state variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a`, `b` is an input integer, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is now 10, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be greater than the current iteration count.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a`, `b` is an input integer, the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is now 10, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be greater than the current iteration count**
