According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is an unknown non-zero value, `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` should be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown non-zero value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100, for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0**
