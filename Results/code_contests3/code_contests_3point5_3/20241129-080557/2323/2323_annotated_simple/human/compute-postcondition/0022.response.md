Example Answer:
The value of `h` is assigned the remainder of `a` divided by 10, which is the last digit of `a`. Since the last digit of `a` is 0, the value of `h` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a`, `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b` for the loop to execute the first time, the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is 0.
