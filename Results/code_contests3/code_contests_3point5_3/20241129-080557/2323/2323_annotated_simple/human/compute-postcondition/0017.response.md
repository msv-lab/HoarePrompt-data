Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the remainder of `a` divided by 10. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will be the last digit of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a`, `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b` for the loop to execute the first time, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.
