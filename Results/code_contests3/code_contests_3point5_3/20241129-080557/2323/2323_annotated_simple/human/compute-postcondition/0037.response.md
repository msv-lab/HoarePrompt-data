Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10, and `a` is then updated by performing integer division by 10. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, and `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10.
Output State: **`h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10**
