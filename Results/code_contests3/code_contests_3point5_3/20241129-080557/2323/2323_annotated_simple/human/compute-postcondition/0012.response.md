Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1, so `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown non-zero value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100, for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated to its integer division by 10.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown non-zero value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is a new value derived from `a` divided by 100, for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated to its integer division by 10.**
