Example Answer:
The value of `a` is modified by dividing it by 10 using the floor division operator `//`. Since `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, after executing the code, `a` will be updated and `h` will reflect the new remainder value. The values of `b`, `c`, and `ans` remain unaffected.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the new remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10**
