Example Answer:
Initially, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, and `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10. After executing the code `a = 10 ** c * h + a`, the value of `a` is updated based on the previous values of `c` and `h`. The new value of `a` is calculated as `10 ** c * h + previous_a`, where `previous_a` is the value of `a` before the execution of the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10, `a` is recalculated based on the updated values of `c` and `h`.
Output State: **`h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated by performing integer division by 10, `a` is recalculated based on the updated values of `c` and `h`**
