Example Answer: 
Variable `c` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a`, `m`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is assigned to `a` (unknown value), `m` is not specified, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0**
