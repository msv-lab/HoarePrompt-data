Example Answer:
In each iteration, `a` gets updated to the minimum value between `a` and `b`, and `h` gets incremented by 1. After `c` iterations, `ans` will contain the minimum remainder of the divisions of the original `a` by `b`. The loop will execute `c` times. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers**
