Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value `a % 10`. The value of `a` is an integer, so `h` will be the remainder of `a` divided by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `h`, `c`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10**
