Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the minimum remainder of the division by `m` among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It handles all the possible good shifts by cycling through each digit of the integer and considering it as the last digit in the shifted integer. The program correctly calculates the remainder for each shift and keeps track of the minimum remainder found so far.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
