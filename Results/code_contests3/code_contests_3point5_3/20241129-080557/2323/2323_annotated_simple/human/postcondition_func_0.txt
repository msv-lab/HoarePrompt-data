The function `func` accepts two positive integers: Stepan's integer `a` and the number `b`. The function calculates the minimum remainder of the divisions of `a` by `b` by iterating over the digits of `a`. The number of digits in `a` is determined by the variable `c`. The function does not have a return value but prints the calculated minimum remainder `ans`.
