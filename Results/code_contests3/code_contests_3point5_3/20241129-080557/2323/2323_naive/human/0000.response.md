Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input integer and the divisor.
- It calculates the length of the input integer and stores it in 'c'.
- It then initializes 'ans' to be the remainder of the input integer divided by the divisor.
- The program then loops through all the digits of the input integer and calculates the remainder after shifting the integer by one position to the right.
- It updates the 'ans' to be the minimum remainder found during the shifting process.
- Finally, it prints the minimum remainder that Stepan can get after dividing all good shifts of his integer by the given number. 

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases, and hence the correctness is True.
