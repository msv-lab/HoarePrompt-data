Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division of all good shifts of Stepan's integer by the given number m. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts of the integer and calculates the remainder for each shift. The program then updates the minimum remainder found so far and finally prints the minimum remainder. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
