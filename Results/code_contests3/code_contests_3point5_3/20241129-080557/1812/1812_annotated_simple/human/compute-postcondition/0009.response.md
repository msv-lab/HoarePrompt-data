Postcondition: ***`S` is the input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and character `s`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` is the positive integer extracted from `S` decreased by either 1 or 2 based on the original value of `M` and increased by the new value of `M`. `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`. `M` is either 1 or 8.***
