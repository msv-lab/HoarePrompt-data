Example Answer:
The value of `N` is extracted from the input string `S` and decreased by 1 or 2 based on the original value of `M` (1 or 2) and then increased by the new value of `M` (1 or 8). The value of `C` is calculated as `ord(s) - ord('a')`. After that, the formula provided is evaluated and printed. 
Output State: **`S` is the input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and character `s`, `M` is either 1 or 8, `N` is the integer extracted from `S`, `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`, and the formula `print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))` is evaluated and printed.**
