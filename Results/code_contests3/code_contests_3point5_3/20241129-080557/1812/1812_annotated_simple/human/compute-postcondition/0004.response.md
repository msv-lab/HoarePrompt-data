Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `N - 1 & 3`, where `N` is the positive integer extracted from the input string `S`, and `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`. The value of `M` will be the result of `(N - 1) bitwise AND 3`. The specific values of `N` and `C` are unknown, so the output state is: `S` is the input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and character `s`, `N` is the positive integer extracted from `S`, `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`.
Output State: **`S` is the input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and character `s`, `N` is the positive integer extracted from `S`, `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`**
