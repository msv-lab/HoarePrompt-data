Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the last character of `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `S` is a positive integer followed by a character, so the last character is the character `s`. Therefore, `C` is calculated as the ASCII value of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The ASCII value of `s` depends on the character `s` given in the input. 
Output State: **`S` is the input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and character `s`, `N` is the positive integer extracted from `S`, `C` is the result of the calculation `ord(s) - ord('a')`**
