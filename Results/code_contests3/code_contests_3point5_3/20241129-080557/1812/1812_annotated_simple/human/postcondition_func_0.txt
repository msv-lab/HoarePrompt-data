The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an input string consisting of a positive integer `n` and a character `s` representing the row number and seat in the row respectively. It then calculates the seat position based on the row number and seat character and prints the result. The calculation involves adjusting the row number `N`, seat character `C`, and a value `M` based on certain conditions.
