Correctness: True

Explanation: 
After carefully examining the program and the problem description, it can be observed that the program correctly calculates the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch based on his seat in the row. The program first reads the input, calculates the row number and seat number, then applies the given logic to determine the waiting time. The logic used in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem description, ensuring that Vasya's waiting time is calculated accurately for all possible inputs. Additionally, the program efficiently handles the calculations without any errors. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
