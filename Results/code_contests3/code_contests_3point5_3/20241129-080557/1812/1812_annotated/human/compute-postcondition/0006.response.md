Example Answer:
The value of N is decreased by the value of M. Since M can only be 1 or 2, N will be decreased by either 1 or 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', C is the result of the ASCII subtraction operation, M is a value between 0 and 3. M is either 1 or 2, N is decreased by either 1 or 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', C is the result of the ASCII subtraction operation, M is a value between 0 and 3. M is either 1 or 2, N is decreased by either 1 or 2**
