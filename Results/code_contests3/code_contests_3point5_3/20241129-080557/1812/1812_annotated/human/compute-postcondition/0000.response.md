Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read a line from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function is defined but not executed, so the state of `n` and `s` remains unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f'**
