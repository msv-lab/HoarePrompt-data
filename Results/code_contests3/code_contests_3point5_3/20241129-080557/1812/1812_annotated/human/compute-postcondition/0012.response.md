Functionality: **The function reads an input string S which consists of a positive integer followed by a character from 'a' to 'f'. It then performs various mathematical operations based on the input values N and C. If M is either 1 or 2, it modifies N and M accordingly. Finally, the function calculates an expression based on the modified N, C, and M, and prints the result.**
