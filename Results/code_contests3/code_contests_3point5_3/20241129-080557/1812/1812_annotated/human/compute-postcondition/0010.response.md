Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `C` is the result of the ASCII subtraction operation, `M` is a value between 0 and 3. If M is either 1 or 2, M is the result of XOR operation between the current value of M and 3. `N` is decreased by either 1 or 2 and increased by M. The expression `(N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)` is printed.**
