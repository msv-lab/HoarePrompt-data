Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value of `gets()`. The previous values of `n` and `s` are positive integer and character from 'a' to 'f' respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input string obtained from gets().
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input string obtained from gets()**
