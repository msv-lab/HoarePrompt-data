Example Answer:
N is assigned the integer value obtained by converting the substring of S, excluding the last character. As n is a positive integer, the value of N will also be a positive integer. The variables s and S are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input string obtained from gets().
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input string obtained from gets()**
