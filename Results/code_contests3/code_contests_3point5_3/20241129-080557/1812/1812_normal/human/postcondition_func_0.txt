The function `func` reads an input string consisting of a positive integer `n` representing the row number and a lowercase letter `s` representing the seat in the row. It then processes these inputs to calculate a value based on certain conditions and prints the result. The function does not explicitly return any value. The calculation involves bitwise operations and arithmetic calculations on `n` and `s`, resulting in a final output printed to the console.
