Example Answer:
N is either 2 or 3, M is either 1 or 0. After executing N += M, N will be incremented by the value of M. Since N can be 2 or 3 and M can be 1 or 0, the possible values of N after the operation are 3 or 4. Therefore, the Output State is: N is either 3 or 4, M is either 1 or 0.
Output State: **N is either 3 or 4, M is either 1 or 0**
