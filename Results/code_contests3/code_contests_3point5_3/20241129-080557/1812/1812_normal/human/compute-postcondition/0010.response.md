Example Answer:
`M` is the result of `(N - 1) & 3`, where `N` is either 3 or 4. If `M` is in (1, 2), then `M` can be either 1 or 0 and `N` can be either 3 or 4. The given code snippet calculates a value based on `N` and `C`, but `C` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will be dependent on the values of `N` and `C` when the code is executed.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `N` and `C` during execution**
