Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case by replacing '9' with '1' in each row, and then outputs the modified grid. This modification ensures that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements, making it an anti-sudoku. The program outputs the expected result for each test case as described in the problem description.
