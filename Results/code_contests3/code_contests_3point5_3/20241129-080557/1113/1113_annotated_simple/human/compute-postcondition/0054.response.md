Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` which contains '1's in place of '9's after all iterations of the loop, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will contain '1's in place of '9's after this iteration and `i` is equal to '9'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will be incremented by `i`.***
