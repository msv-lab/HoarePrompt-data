Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` still has more characters to iterate over. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to the existing value of `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
