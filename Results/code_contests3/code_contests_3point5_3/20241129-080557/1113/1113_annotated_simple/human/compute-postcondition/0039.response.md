Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9', `nRow` now has an additional '1' at the end. If `i` is '9', the function continues with `nRow` having an additional '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` has at least one '1', and `nRow` has the value of `nRow` + '9'.***
