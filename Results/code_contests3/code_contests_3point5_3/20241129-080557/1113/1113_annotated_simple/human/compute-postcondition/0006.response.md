Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer**
