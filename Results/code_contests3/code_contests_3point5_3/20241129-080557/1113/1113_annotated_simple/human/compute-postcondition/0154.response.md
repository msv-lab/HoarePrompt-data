According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the first character of `row`. `i` is the first character of `row` and `i` is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` needs to remain not empty, `res` should still contain 10 identical lists of `nRow`, and `i` should be updated to the next character in `row` that is not '9'.
State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'**
