Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a 9x9 grid of digits from 1 to 9, replaces '9's with '1's in each row, and stores the modified rows in a list `res`. The function then outputs the modified grid. The functionality is limited to modifying the grid by replacing '9's with '1's.**
