Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list, which contains 11 identical lists. After this operation, `res` will contain 12 lists, where the last element is the updated `nRow` with all '9's replaced by '1'. The variables `maxint`, `T`, `t`, and `row` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 12 lists with the last one representing the updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty.**
