According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is either '1' or the first character in `row`, `i` is either '9' or not equal to '9' depending on the condition checked in the if-else block. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements in the `row` string.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has more elements, `nRow` is either '1' or the first character in `row`, `i` is either '9' or not equal to '9' depending on the condition checked in the if else block**
