Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. As the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, the output state is: `row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'.
Output State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'**
