Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, where `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'. The new value of `nRow` depends on the current value of `nRow` and the value of `i`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'.
Output State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'**
