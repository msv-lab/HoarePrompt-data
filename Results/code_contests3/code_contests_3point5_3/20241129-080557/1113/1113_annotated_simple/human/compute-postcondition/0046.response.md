According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range of 9, the loop will execute 9 times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, and `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to 9.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row` after all iterations of the loop have executed, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be 9**
