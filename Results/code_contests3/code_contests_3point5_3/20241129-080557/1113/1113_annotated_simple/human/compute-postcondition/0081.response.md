Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` can be '11' or the string with the next character of `row` appended depending on conditions. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be either '111' or the string with the next character of `row` appended. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, more characters left in `row`, `nRow` is either '111' or the string with the next character of `row` appended depending on conditions**
