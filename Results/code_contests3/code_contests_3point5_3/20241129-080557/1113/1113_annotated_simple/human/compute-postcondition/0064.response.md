Example Answer: 
The list `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The list `res` originally contains `nRow` which has '1's in place of '9's in `row`. After the append operation, `res` will now contain two identical lists of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing two identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. All '9's in `row` have been replaced by '1's in `nRow`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing two identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. All '9's in `row` have been replaced by '1's in `nRow`**
