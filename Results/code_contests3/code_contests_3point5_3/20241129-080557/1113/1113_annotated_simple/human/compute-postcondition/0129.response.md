According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `row` string. Since `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `nRow` should consist of '1's in place of '9's. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's**
