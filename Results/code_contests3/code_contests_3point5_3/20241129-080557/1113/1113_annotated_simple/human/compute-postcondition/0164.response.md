According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1**
