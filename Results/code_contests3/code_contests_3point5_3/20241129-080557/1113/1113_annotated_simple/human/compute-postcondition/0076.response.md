According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters left in the `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `nRow` is either '1' if the first character of `row` is '9', or the string consisting of the first character of `row` if `i` is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, more characters left in `row`, `nRow` is either '1' if the next character of `row` is '9', or the string consisting of the next character of `row` if `i` is not equal to '9'**
