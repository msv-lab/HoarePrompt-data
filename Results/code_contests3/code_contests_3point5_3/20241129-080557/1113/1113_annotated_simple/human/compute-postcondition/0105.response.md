According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 10.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the final string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 10**
