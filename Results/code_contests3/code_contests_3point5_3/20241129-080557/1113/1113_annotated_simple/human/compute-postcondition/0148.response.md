According to the code, the loop can execute if the input `row` is not empty. Also, since the loop range should be 10, the loop will execute 10 times. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string, which means for the loop to execute the first time, `row` should not be an empty string and `i` should be the first character in `row`.
State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in `row`**
