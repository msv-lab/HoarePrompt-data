According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters remaining in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the `row` string must be processed. If this character is '9', then `nRow` should be appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` should be appended with '1' followed by this character. After the `if else` block executes, `nRow` is appended with `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration**.
