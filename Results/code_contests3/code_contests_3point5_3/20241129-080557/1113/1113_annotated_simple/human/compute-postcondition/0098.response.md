Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration. If this character is '9', then `nRow` should be appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` should be appended with '1' followed by this character. After the if else block executes, `nRow` is appended with `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'.***
