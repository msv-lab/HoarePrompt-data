According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string. Therefore, the loop will execute when the string `row` is not empty.

For the loop to execute the first time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is the first character in `row`**
