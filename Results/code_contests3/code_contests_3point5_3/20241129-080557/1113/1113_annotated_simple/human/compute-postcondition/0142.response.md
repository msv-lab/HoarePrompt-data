Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` has at least one more character to iterate over, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's based on the previous iterations. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is extended by adding '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.***
