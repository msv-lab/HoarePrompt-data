According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times in total. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`. To execute the loop one more time, the loop counter `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the range in the for loop should be adjusted to range(10).
State: **After appending `nRow` to `res`, `res` now contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, for the loop to execute one more time the range should be 10**
