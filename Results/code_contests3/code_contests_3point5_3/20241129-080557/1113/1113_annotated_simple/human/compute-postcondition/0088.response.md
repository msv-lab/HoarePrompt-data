Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 10.
