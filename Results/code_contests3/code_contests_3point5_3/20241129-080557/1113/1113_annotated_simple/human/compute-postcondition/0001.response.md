Example Answer:
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be executed at exit, which writes the output of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. The grid of 9x9 cells with digits from 1 to 9 is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.**
