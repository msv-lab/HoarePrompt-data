According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has been completely traversed, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row` and the original characters for other elements in `row`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
