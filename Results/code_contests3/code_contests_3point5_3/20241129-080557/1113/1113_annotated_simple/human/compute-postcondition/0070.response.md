According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is an input string stripped of leading or trailing whitespaces, it must have at least one character for the loop to execute. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `i` is the first character in the string `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `i` is the first character in the string `row`**
