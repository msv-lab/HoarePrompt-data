According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `row`. If `i` is '9', the loop will execute one more time with `nRow` having an additional '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` has at least one '1' and `nRow` has the value of `nRow` + '9'. 

At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9', `nRow` now has an additional '1' at the end. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9', `nRow` has an additional '1' at the end**
