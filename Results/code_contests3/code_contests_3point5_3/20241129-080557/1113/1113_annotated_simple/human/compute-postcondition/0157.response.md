Postcondition: ***`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'. If i == '9', the program retains the initial state. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the previous values along with the next character in `row` that is not '9', `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'.***
