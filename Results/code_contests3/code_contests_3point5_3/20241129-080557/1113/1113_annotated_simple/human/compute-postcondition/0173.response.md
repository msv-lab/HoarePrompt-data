According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow` where `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1. If the last character in `row` is '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. Otherwise, `nRow` will be the concatenation of all characters in `row` except '9', and `i` will not be equal to '9'. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow` where `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1 after the next iteration**
