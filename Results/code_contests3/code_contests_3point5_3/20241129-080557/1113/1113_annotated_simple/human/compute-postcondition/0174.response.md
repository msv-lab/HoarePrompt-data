Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so if the initial value of `nRow` was '999', after execution it becomes '9991'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow` where `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1 after the next iteration.
