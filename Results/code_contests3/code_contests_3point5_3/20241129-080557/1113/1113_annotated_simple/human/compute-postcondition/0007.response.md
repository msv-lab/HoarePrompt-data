According to the code, the loop can execute if the input integer T is greater than 0. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to T is greater than 0 and t is 0.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
