Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is either '1' or a string depending on the condition, so after execution, `nRow` will be '11' or a string with the character '1' appended. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, more characters left in `row`, `nRow` is either '11' or the string with the next character of `row` appended depending on conditions.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, more characters left in `row`, `nRow` is either '11' or the string with the next character of `row` appended depending on conditions**
