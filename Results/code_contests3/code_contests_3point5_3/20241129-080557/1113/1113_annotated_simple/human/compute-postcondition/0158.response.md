According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` and `i`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'. If i == '9', the program retains the initial state. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the previous values along with the next character in `row` that is not '9', `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next character in `row` that is not '9'.
State: **`row` is not empty, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `nRow` can have multiple values based on the conditions, `i` is the next character in `row` that is not '9'**
