According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `row`. To ensure the loop executes, the input string `row` must not be empty. At the end of the tenth iteration, `nRow` should contain '1's in place of '9's after all iterations. For the loop to execute a tenth time, `i` should be 9. The other states need to be adjusted accordingly as follows:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` contains '1's in place of '9's after all iterations of the loop, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` is 9**
