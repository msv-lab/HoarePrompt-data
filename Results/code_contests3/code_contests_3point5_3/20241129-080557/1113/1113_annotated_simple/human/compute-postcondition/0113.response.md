Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. If the first character of `row` is not '9', then `nRow` is the first character of `row`.***
