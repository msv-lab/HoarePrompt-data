Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1' at the end of the string, so the new value of `nRow` will have one additional '1' at the end. Since the initial state does not mention the specific value of `nRow`, the output state will include the updated value of `nRow` with the additional '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty with at least one more character to iterate over, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's based on the previous iterations, `nRow` has one additional '1' at the end**
