Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the value of the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variable `res` now contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, but the value of `nRow` is not provided. To execute the loop one more time, the range should be 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is the input after stripping whitespaces, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, and the loop range should be 10.
Output State: **`row` is the input after stripping whitespaces, `res` contains 10 identical lists of `nRow`, loop range should be 10**
