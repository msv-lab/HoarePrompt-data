Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` which contains '1's in place of '9's after all iterations of the loop, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, the next character in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains '1' if i == '9' and `nRow` is concatenated with `i` if i != '9' after the execution of the if else block.***
