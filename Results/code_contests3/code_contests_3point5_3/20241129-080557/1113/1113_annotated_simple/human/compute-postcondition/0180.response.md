Postcondition: ***`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow` where `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1 after the next iteration. If `i` is equal to '9', the current state remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` has '1' concatenated to it.***
