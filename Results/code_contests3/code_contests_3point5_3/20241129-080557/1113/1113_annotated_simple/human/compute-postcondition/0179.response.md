Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, which is the last character in `row` plus 1. If `i` is '9', the state remains unchanged. The value of `i` depends on the last character in `row`, so it can be any character except '9'. After execution, the `nRow` will have the last character of `row` plus 1 appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1 after the next iteration.
Output State: **`row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `res` contains 11 identical lists of `nRow`, `i` is the last character in `row` plus 1 after the next iteration**
