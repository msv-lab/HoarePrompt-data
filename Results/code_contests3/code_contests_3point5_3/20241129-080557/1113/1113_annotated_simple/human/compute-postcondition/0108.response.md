According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `row` string. Since `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. At the end of the loop, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is an empty string. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state so that `row` is not empty, and the loop starts with the first character of `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
