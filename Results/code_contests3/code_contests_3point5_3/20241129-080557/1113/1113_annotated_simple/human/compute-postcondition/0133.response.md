Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will not contain any '9's. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain '1's at the end based on the previous state. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's.**
