The value of `nRow` is updated by adding `i`. The previous values of the variables are `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` still has more characters to iterate over. After execution, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` still has more characters to iterate over, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` still has more characters to iterate over, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
