According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times since the range is set to 9. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `nRow`. 
For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0 and `nRow` should be updated based on the input string `row` after the first iteration.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row` after the first iteration**
