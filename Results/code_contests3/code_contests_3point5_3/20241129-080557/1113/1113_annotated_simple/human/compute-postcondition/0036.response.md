According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nRow`. If `i` is equal to '9' and `nRow` has at least one '1', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9', `nRow` has at least one '1'. 

If `i` is equal to '9' at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to '9', and `nRow` should have one additional '1' added at the end. 

If `i` is not equal to '9', at the end of the last iteration, `nRow` should be incremented by 9 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9', `nRow` has at least one '1'**
