The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, where `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide information about `i`, the output state will be:
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty with at least one more character to iterate over, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's based on the previous iterations**
