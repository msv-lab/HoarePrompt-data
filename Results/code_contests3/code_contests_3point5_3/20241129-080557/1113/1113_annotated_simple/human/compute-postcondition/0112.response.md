Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` which is the first character of `row`. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, after execution, `nRow` will be equal to the first character of `row`. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`. The first character of `row` is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`. The first character of `row` is not '9'**
