According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. At the start, `row` is assigned an input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, so for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must be a non-empty string. Additionally, `i` will iterate over each character in `row`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be the first character in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in `row`**
