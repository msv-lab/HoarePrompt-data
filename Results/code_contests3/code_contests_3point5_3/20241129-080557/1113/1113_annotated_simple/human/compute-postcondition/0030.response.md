According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `row`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `i` variable should be set to 9 after the loop's last iteration. Additionally, since `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row`, `nRow` should be updated to have at least one '1' to continue the loop.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` consists of '1's in place of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 9, `nRow` has at least one '1'**
