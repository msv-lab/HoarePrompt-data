According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 10 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 identical lists of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 10**
