Example Answer: 
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 identical lists of updated `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the final string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 10.
