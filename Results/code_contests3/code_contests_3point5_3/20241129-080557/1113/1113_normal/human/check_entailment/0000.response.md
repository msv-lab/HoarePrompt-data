Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints suggest that the code modifies the input by replacing '9's with '1's in each row, then concatenates the modified rows to form a new grid. However, the code actually just replaces '9's with '1's in each row and stores them in a list without concatenating them to form the new grid. This means that the output of the code will not be a valid anti-sudoku grid as required by the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
