According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` can be either an empty string or '1', `i` is 9, and `i` can be either an integer 9 or a string '9'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` can be either an empty string or '1', `i` is 10, and `nRow` is set to '1'**
