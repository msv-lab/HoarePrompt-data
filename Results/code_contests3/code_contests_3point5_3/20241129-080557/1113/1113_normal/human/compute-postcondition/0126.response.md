According to the code, the loop will always execute as it iterates over a range of 9. 
Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `row`, `nRow`, and `t` remain unchanged.
State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `row`, `nRow`, and `t` are positive integers and `row` is a string with at least 10 characters**.
