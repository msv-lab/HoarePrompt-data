Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is '1' if `i` is equal to '9', `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9 and `i` is equal to '9' after entering the if statement. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the concatenation of its previous value and the current value of `i` (0), `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
