According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '11'. Since `i` is not '9', `nRow` should be set to '110'. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '110', `i` is 11**.
