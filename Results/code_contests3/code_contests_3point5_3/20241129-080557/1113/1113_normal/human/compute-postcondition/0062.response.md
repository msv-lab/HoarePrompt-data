Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains '1' if `i` is equal to '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` contains the modified `nRow`. `i` is increased by 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `row`.***
