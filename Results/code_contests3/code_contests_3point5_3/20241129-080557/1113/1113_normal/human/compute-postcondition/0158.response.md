According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11'
- If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is the concatenation of the value of `i` with '1'
- If `i` is '9', then `i` is '9'
- If `i` is not '9', `i` retains its original value
- `row` is a non-empty string

In order for the loop to execute another time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` remain the same, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '12'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is the concatenation of the value of `i` with '1'. `i` retains its original value. `row` remains a non-empty string for the loop to execute another time**
