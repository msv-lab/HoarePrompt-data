Postcondition: ***Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` is greater than 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1' and `i` is equal to '9'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is the string representation of the integer value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
