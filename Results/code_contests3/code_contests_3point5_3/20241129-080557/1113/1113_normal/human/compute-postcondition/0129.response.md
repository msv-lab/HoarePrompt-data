According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `row` has at least 1 character. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string, which means `row` should be a non-empty string for the loop to execute. Additionally, the variable `i` will be iterating over the characters in `row`, so it should be adjusted to the first character in `row`. Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are: 
State: **`T`, `i` is the first character in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, and `t` are positive integers, `nRow` is an empty string**
