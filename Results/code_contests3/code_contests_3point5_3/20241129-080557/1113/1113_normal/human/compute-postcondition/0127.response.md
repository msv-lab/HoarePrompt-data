Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value, which removes any leading and trailing whitespaces. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `row`, `nRow`, and `t` are positive integers and `row` is a string with at least 10 characters.
Output State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `row`, `nRow`, and `t` are positive integers and `row` is a string with at least 10 characters**
