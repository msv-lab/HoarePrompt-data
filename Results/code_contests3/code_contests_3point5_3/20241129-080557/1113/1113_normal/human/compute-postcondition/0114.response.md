According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nRow` is either '1' or '0', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `nRow` needs to be updated based on the condition mentioned in the code.
State: **`T`, `i` is 1, `nRow` is either '0' or '1', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'**.
