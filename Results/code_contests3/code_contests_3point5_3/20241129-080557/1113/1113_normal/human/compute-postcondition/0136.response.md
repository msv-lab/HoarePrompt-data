Example Answer:
The code appends the string '1' to the end of the variable `nRow`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `nRow`, the resulting `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `i+1` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` ends with '1'.
Output State: **`T`, `i+1` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` ends with '1'**
