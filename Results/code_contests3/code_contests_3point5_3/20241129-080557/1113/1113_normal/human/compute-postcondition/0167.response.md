According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `row`. Since `row` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we cannot make any assumptions about its value. However, for the loop to execute a tenth time, `i` must be less than 9. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 9. 

State: **`T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` is 9**
