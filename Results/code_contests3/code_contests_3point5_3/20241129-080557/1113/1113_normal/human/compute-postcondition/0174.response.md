Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so the value of `nRow` becomes '11'. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are the same as before, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is now '11'.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are the same as before, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is now '11'**
