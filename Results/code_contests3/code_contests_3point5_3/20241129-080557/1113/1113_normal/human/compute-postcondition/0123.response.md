Output State: **`T`, `i` are integers, `nRow` is a string containing only '0' and '1' characters based on the condition in the loop, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'.**
