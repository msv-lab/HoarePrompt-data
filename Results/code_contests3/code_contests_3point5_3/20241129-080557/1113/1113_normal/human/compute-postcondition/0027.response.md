According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string, `nRow` is a modified string, `res` contains the modified `nRow`. To execute the loop one more time, the `i` value needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 9. 
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string, `nRow` is a modified string, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9**
