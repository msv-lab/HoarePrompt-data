Example Answer:
The `write('\n'.join(res))` function is called, which joins all the elements in the `res` list with a newline character and then writes it out. The variables `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `t`, `row` remain unchanged as the function only outputs the modified `res` list. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are positive integers. `row` is a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, and the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` contains all the modified `nRow`. `i` is equal to the length of `row`, and `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.
