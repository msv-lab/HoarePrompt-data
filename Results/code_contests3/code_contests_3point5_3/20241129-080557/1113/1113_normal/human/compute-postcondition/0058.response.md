Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is a string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` contains the modified `nRow`. `i` has been increased by 1.***
