Postcondition: ***`T`, `i` are integers, `nRow` is either '01' or '11', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'. If i == '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`. In the if part, `nRow` is appended with '1'.***
