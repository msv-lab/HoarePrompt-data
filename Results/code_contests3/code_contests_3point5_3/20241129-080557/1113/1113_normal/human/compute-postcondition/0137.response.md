Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is a string, and `i` is an integer. After execution, the new value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of the previous `nRow` and the integer `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `i+1` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` is a string concatenated with the integer `i`.
Output State: **`T`, `i+1` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` is a string concatenated with the integer `i`**
