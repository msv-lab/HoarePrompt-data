Postcondition: ***`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. If `i` equals '9', then `i` is set to '9' and `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `T`, `nRow`, `res` contain the modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'.***
