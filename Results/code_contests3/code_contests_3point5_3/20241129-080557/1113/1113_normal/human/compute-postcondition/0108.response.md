According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `row` is not empty. Since `row` is assigned the stripped input value, it indicates that the loop can execute if there is input available for `row`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it needs to be adjusted to 0 before the loop starts. Also, `nRow` being an empty string does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`T`, `i` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value, for the loop to execute the first time**
