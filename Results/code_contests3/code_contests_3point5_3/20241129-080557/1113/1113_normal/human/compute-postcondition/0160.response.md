Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` remain the same. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '129'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with the value of `i`. `i` retains its original value. `row` remains a non-empty string for the loop to execute another time**
