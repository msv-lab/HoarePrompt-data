According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` and the character at index `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `i` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` is a string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` contains the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the character at index `i+1` in `row` needs to be accessed.
State: **`T`, `i+1` are the first characters in `row`, `res`, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `t` are positive integers, `nRow` is a string**.
