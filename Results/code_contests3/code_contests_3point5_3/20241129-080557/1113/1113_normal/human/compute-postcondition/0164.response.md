According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `t`, `res` remain the same, and `nRow` is added to the list `res`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than 9.
State: **`T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is added to the list `res`, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be less than 9**
