Example Answer:
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables remain the same as before. Since no other variables are affected directly, the output state is: `T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be less than 9.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be less than 9**
