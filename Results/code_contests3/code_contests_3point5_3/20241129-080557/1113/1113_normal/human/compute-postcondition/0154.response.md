According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `row` is a non-empty string. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow`, and `row` need to be adjusted for the next iteration. If the condition `(i == '9')` is true, then `i` will be '9' and `nRow` will be '1'. If the condition is false, then `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still be a non-empty string.
State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings. If the condition `(i == '9')` is true, `i` is '9' and `nRow` is '1'. If the condition is false, `nRow` contains the value of `i`. `row` is a non-empty string for the loop to execute another time**.
