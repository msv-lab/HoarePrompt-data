Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is either '011' if `i` is equal to '9' or '019' if `i` is not equal to '9', `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9, and `i` is not equal to '9'***
