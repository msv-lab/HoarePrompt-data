Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'. Since the initial state of `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is not '9', the value of `nRow` will be the string representation of the integer value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: Output State is not affected, T is greater than 0, row is assigned the stripped input value, nRow is the string representation of the integer value of i, i is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **Output State is not affected, T is greater than 0, row is assigned the stripped input value, nRow is the string representation of the integer value of i, i is not equal to '9'**
