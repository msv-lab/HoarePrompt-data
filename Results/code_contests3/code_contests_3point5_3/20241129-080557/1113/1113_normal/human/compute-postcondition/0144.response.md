Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is determined based on the presence of '9' in `row`. If '9' is present in `row`, it is replaced by '1' in `nRow`, otherwise, `nRow` remains the same as `row`. After this operation, `nRow` is appended to the `res` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res`, `row`, `nRow` are strings, and the updated `res` list contains `nRow`.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `row`, `nRow` are strings, and the updated `res` list contains `nRow`**
