Example Answer:
Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, and `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.

After executing the code `nRow = ''`, `nRow` is reassigned an empty string. The values of `i`, `res`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are all positive integers, `i` is 9, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, and `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.
Output State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow` is an empty string, `res`, `t` are all positive integers, `i` is 9, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`**
