Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, where `i` is not '9'. Since the initial value of `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is not '9', after execution, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings, `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `i` is not '9'.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings, `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `i` is not '9'**
