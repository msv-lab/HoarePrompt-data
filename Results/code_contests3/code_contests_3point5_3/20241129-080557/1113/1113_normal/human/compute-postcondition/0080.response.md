According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` still has at least 1 character left, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `i`, `row`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are all positive integers. `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9, `res` contains all the modified `nRow`, `i` is the length of `row`, `t` is incremented by 2.

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must have at least 1 character remaining. 

State: **`T`, `i`, `row`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are all positive integers. `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9, `res` contains all the modified `nRow`, `i` is the length of `row`, `t` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `row` has at least 1 character.**
