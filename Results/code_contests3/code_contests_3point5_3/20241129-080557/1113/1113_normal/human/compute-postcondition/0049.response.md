According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9. Since `i` is determined by the iteration over `row`, the string `row` must have at least 10 characters for `i` to be less than 9. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `row` should be a string with at least 10 characters, and `i` should be less than 9.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than 9**
