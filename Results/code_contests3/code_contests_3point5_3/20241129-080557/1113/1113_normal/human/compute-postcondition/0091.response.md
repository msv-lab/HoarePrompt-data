Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. When the if condition (i == '9') is true, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'**
