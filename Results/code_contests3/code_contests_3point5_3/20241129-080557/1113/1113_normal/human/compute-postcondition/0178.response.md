Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1101'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '1101', `i` is 11.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '1101', `i` is 11**
