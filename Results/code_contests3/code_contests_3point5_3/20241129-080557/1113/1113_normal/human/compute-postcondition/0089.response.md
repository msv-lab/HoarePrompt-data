According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, so they need to be adjusted to be initialized properly. `res` contains all the modified `nRow` so it should be updated accordingly. `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
