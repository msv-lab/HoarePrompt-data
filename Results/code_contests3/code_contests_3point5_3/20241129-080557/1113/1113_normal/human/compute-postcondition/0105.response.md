According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nRow`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res` are all modified, `nRow` contains the value of `i` concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9', `res` contains the updated `nRow` appended at the end. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `nRow` needs to be updated accordingly, and all the other states need to be maintained.
State: **`T`, `i` is incremented by 1, `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty**
