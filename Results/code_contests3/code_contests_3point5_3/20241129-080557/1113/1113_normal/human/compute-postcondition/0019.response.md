Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, and `i` is also unknown. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated. Therefore, the Output State is: Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated.
Output State: **Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated.**
