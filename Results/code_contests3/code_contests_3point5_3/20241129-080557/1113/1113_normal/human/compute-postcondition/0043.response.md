Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is either '0111' if `i` is equal to '9' or '0191' if `i` is not equal to '9', `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9, and `i` is not equal to '9'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '0111' and `res` contains the modified `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is '0191' and `res` contains the modified `nRow`.***
