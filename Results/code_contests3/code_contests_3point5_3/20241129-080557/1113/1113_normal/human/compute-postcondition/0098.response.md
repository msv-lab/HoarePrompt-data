Postcondition: ***`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'. If `i` is '9', then `T`, `i`, `res` contain all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `nRow` contains '1', `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'. Otherwise, `T`, `i`, `res` contain all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'.***
