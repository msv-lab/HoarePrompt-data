Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The other variables remain unchanged. The loop will execute a tenth time if `i` is less than 9. 
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is added to the list `res`, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be less than 9**
