Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is a string equal to '9'.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is a string equal to '9'**
