Example Answer:
`nRow` is created by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', and all other characters remain the same. The value of `T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string, and `nRow` is a modified string. The `res` list is appended with the modified `nRow`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string, `nRow` is a modified string, `res` contains the modified `nRow`**
