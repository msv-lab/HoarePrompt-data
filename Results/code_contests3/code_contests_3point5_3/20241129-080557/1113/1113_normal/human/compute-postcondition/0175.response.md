Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 10. As `nRow` was initially set to '1', after the execution, `nRow` will be '110'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '110', `i` is 10.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '110', `i` is 10**
