Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are positive integers. `row` is a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, and the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` contains all the modified `nRow`. `i` is equal to the length of `row`, and `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.**
