Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string representation of `i`, which results in '11011'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '11011', `i` is 11.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` are the same as before, `nRow` is '11011', `i` is 11**
