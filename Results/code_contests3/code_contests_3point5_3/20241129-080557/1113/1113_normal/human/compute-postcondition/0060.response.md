Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` was equal to '9', then `nRow` would contain '11'. Otherwise, `nRow` would contain the values of `i` concatenated, where `i` is less than 9. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `row`. The value of `i` will be increased by 1.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains '1' or values of `i` concatenated, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is increased by 1**
