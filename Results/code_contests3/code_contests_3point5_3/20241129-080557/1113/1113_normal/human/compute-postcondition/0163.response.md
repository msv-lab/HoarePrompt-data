Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous values of the variables are `T`, `t`, `res`, and `nRow`. As `nRow` contains '1' for every occurrence of '9' in `row`, the value of `nRow` is added to the list `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, and `nRow` is added to the list `res`.
Output State: **`T`, `t`, `res` is the same as before, `nRow` is added to the list `res`**
