Postcondition: ***`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is the concatenation of the value of `i` with '1'. If `i` is '9', then `i` is '9'. If `i` is not '9', `i` retains its original value. `row` is a non-empty string for the loop to execute another time.***
