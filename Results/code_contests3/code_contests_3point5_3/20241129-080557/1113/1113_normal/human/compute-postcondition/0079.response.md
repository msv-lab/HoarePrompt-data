Postcondition: ***`T`, `i`, `row`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are all positive integers. Initially, `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9, `res` contains all the modified `nRow`, `i` is the length of `row`, `t` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `row` has at least 1 character. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` will have '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` will be incremented by `i`.***
