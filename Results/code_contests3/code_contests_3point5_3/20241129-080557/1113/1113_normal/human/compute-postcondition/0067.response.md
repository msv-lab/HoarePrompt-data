According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 8. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `t` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9, `res` contains all the modified `nRow`, `i` is equal to the length of `row`, `t` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
