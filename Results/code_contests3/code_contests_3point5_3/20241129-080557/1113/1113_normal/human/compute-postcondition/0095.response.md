According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `row` is not empty and `i` is different from '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` should not be empty and `i` should be different from '9'.
State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'**
