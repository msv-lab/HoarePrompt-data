According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be greater than 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, and `nRow` is an empty string.
State: **Output State is not affected, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string**
