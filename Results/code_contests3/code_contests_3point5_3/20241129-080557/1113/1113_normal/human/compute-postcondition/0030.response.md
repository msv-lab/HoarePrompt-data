According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `row`. Since we need the loop to execute 10 times, we need to adjust the state such that `row` has at least 10 characters. Also, `i` is used to iterate over the characters in `row`, so it should start at 0 and reach 9 by the 10th iteration. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the 10th time `i` is 9**
