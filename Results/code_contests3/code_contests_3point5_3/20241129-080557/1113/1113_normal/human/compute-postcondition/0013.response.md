Example Answer: 
The value '1' is concatenated to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, it now becomes '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Output State is not affected, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `nRow` is '1'. When the if condition `i == '9'` is true, `i` is equal to '9'.
