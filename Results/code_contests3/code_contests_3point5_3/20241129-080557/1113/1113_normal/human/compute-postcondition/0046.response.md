According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times as the range is specified as 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains the modified `nRow`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than 9.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains the modified `nRow`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than 9**
