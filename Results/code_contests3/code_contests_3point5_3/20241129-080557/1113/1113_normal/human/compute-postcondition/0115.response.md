Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1', so if `nRow` was '0' before, it becomes '01'. If `nRow` was '1' before, it becomes '11'. Therefore, the Output State is: `T`, `i` is 1, `nRow` is either '01' or '11', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'.
Output State: **`T`, `i` is 1, `nRow` is either '01' or '11', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'**
