Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', and `res` contains the modified `nRow`. The value of `i` is 9, but it is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains the modified `nRow`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains the modified `nRow`**
