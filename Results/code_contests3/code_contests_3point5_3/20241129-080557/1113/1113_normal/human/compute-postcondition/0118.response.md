According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `row`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `nRow` is either '01' or '11', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'. If i == '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2 and `nRow` needs to be updated based on the conditions mentioned.
State: **`T`, `i` is 2, `nRow` is either '01' or '11', `res` is updated, `t` is incremented, `row` is not empty and assigned the stripped input value. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0'. If i == '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
