According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `T`, `row`, `i`, and `nRow`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the output state is not affected. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` is greater than 0 and `row` is assigned the stripped input value. 

If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1' and `i` is equal to '9'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is the string representation of the integer value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop is iterating over `row`, the next iteration depends on the next character in `row`.
- If the next character in `row` is available, `i` will be updated to that character.
- If there are no more characters in `row`, the loop will not execute again.

State: **Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated.**
