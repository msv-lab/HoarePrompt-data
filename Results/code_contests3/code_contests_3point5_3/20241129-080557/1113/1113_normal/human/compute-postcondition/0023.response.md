Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. The program retains its initial state without any change after the execution of the if else block. Therefore, the Output State is: Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated. The program retains its initial state without any change after the execution of the if else block.
Output State: **Output State is not affected. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` should be available for `i` to be updated. The program retains its initial state without any change after the execution of the if else block.**
