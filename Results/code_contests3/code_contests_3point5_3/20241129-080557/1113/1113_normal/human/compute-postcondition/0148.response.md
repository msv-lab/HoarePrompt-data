According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string which doesn't ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is a non-empty string.
State: **`T`, `t`, `res`, `nRow` are strings, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is a non-empty string**
