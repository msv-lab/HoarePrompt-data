Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `row` contains the input string, `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9, `res` contains all the modified `nRow`, `i` is the length of `row`, `t` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, for the loop to execute the first time `row` has at least 1 character and `i` is not equal to '9'***
