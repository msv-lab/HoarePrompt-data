According to the code, the loop can execute again if `row` is not empty and `i` is different from '9'. At the end of the last iteration, `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res` are empty strings, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `T`, `i`, `res` contain all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `nRow` contains '1', `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'. Otherwise, `T`, `i`, `res` contain all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'.
So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`T`, `i`, `nRow` are empty strings, `res` contains all modified `nRow`, `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`, `nRow` contains the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, and `i` is different from '9'**.
