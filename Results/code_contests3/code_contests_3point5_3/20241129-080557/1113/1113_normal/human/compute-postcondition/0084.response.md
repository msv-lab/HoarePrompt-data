Output State: **`T`, `i`, `row`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are all positive integers. After the loop executes, `nRow` will contain '1' for each '9' in `row`, and the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` will contain all the modified `nRow`. `i` will be the length of `row`. `t` will be incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.**
