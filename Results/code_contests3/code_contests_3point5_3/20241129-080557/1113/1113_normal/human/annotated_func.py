    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `T`, `i`, `nRow`, `res`, `t` are positive integers. `row` is a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains '1' for each '9' in `row`, and the values of `i` concatenated where `i` is less than 9. `res` contains all the modified `nRow`. `i` is equal to the length of `row`, and `t` is incremented by the total number of '9's in `row`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes input data representing a sudoku solution. It modifies the input by replacing '9's with '1's in each row, then concatenates the modified rows to form a new grid. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It aims to output the modified grid representing the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle.
