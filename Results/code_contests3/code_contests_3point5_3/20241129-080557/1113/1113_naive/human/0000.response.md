Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program reads in the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle and then changes at most 9 elements to make it an anti-sudoku. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it iterates through each row of the sudoku puzzle and changes at most one '9' to '1' in each row. This change ensures that there are at least two equal elements in each row, column, and 3x3 block, satisfying the conditions for an anti-sudoku. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, we can conclude that it is correct.
