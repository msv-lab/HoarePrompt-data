    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the final modified `nRow` strings for all iterations of the loop, `T` is positive, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is equal to 8, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` contains the final modified string after replacing '9's with '1's for all rows in the loop.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and modifies input strings by replacing '9's with '1's. It reads input values, performs the modification, and then outputs the modified strings. However, the annotations mention postconditions that are not fully reflected in the code. The function does not handle any return values explicitly.
