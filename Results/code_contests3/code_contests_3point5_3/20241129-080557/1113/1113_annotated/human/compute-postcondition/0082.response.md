Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by concatenating its previous value with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, so `nRow` is concatenated with that value. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains '1' if the last element in the updated `row` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains '1' if the last element in the updated `row` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i` for the next iteration**
