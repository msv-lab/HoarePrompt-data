According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `row` is not empty and `i` is 9 and the last element in `row` is '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it if the last element in `row` is '9', for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is 9, and the last element in `row` is '9'. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string, `res` has `nRow` appended to it if the last element in `row` is '9', for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is 9, and the last element in `row` is '9'. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` contains the value of `i` appended to it, for the loop to execute one more time, the last element in `row` needs to be '9' and `i` needs to be 9.
