Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value**
