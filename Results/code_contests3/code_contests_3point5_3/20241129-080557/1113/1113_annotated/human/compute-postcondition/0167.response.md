According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `row` is an iterable object. In this case, `row` is a string, and the loop will iterate over each character in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 9 (increased by 1), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
