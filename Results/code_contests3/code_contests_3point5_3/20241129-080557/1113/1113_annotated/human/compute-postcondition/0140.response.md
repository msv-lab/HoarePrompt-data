Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` should not be equal to the last character in the `row` string, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'.
Output State: **`i` should not be equal to the last character in the `row` string, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'**
