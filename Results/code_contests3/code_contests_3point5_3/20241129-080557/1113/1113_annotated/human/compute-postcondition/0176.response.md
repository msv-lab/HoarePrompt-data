Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains the value of `i` for the next element in `row` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of `i` appended to its previous value.***
