Example Answer:
The code registers a lambda function using `atexit.register`, which will write the value of `sys.stdout` to standard output using `os.write(1, ...)` when the program exits. The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object. Therefore, the Output State is: Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the lambda function is registered for writing the value of `sys.stdout` on program exit.
Output State: **Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the lambda function is registered for writing the value of `sys.stdout` on program exit.**
