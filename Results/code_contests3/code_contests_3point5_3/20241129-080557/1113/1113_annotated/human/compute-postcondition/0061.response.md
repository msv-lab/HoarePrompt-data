Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to `nRow`. Since `nRow` is not empty and `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, the value of `nRow` will be updated by adding `i` to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`**
