Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended with '1'. Since `i` is 10, the new value of `nRow` will be '101'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '101'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '101'**
