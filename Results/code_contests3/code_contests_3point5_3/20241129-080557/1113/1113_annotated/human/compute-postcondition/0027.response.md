According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 9. Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty iterable object**
