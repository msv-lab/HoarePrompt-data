Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object**
