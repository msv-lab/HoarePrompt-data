Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is contained in `res`. The updated `nRow` will have the previous value of `res` with '1' appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` has more elements.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` has more elements**
