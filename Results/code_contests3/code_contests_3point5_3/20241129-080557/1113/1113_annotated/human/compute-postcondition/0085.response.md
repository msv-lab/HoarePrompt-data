Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is appended to the `res` list. If the last element in the updated `row` is '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i` for each element in `row`. The initial state states that `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, so the value of `nRow` is determined based on this condition. The variables `maxint`, `T`, `t`, `row` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty.**
