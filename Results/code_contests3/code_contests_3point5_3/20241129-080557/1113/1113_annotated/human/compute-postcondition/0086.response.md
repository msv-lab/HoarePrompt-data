According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty and `i` is less than 9. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last element in the updated `row`, which is the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element after the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty**
