Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty. If the last element in the updated `row` is '9', `nRow` contains '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i` for the next iteration.***
