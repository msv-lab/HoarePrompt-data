Example Answer:
The user inputs a string that is stripped and assigned to the variable `row`. The previous values of the variables are kept the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element after the last element in the updated `row`, `row` contains the user input.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element after the last element in the updated `row`, `row` contains the user input**
