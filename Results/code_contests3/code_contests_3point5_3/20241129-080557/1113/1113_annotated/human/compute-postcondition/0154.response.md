According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` is '1' if `i` equals '9'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated after each iteration of the loop by incrementing `i`. `row` is a non-empty string with whitespace stripped.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` is '1' if `i` equals '9'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated after each iteration of the loop by incrementing `i` to the next character in `row`.**
