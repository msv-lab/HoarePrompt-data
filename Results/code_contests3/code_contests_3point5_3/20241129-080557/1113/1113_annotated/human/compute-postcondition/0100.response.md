Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by '1', so if the previous value of `nRow` is '123', after execution, `nRow` becomes '1231'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` has the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements after the last iteration, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i`, `nRow` is '1231'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` has the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements after the last iteration, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i`, `nRow` is '1231'**
