The value of `i` is added to `nRow`. Since `i` is the first element in `row` and `row` is not empty, and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will be updated with the addition of the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `i` is not equal to '9'**
