Example Answer:
The `write('\n'.join(res))` statement joins all the modified strings in the `res` list with a newline character and prints the result. Since the initial state does not mention the contents of `res` or any modifications to `nRow`, we can directly output the final strings that were modified and stored in `res` as the Output State.
Output State: **final modified strings in `res` printed with a newline separator**
