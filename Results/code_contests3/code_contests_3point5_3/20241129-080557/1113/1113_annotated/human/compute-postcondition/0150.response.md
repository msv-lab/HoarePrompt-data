Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is initially empty, it will now contain '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string with whitespace stripped, `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
