Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The final value of `nRow` will have all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1'. The values of `maxint`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is not empty.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is not empty**
