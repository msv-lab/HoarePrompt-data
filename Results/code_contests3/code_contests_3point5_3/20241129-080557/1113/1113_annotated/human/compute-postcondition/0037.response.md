Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so if `nRow` initially contained 'abc', after execution it will be 'abc1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is a string containing '1' appended with the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is a string containing '1' appended with the new value of `i'abc1'**
