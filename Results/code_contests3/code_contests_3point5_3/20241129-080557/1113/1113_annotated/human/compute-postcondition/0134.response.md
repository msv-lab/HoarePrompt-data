Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` ranges from 0 to 8 for each iteration of the loop, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` contains the final modified string after each iteration of the loop, `row` is assigned the stripped input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string to enter the loop, `i` represents the first character in the `row` string for the first iteration, `nRow` is updated with the modified string after each iteration, `i` represents the last character in the `row` string at the end of the loop. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then after the execution of the code snippet, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
