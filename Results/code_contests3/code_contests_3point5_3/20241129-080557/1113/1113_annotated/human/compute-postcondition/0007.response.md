According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If T is positive, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is positive and t is now 0. 
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is positive**
