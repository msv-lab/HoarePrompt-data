According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the string `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `row` will be processed. If the current `i` is equal to '9', then the next element in `nRow` will be '91'. Otherwise, the next element in `nRow` will be the current `i` appended to its previous value.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, if `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains the value of '91' for the next element in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of `i` appended to its previous value.**
