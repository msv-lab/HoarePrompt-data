Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, where `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string incremented by 1, `row` contains the original string before modifications.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string incremented by 1, `row` contains the original string before modifications**
