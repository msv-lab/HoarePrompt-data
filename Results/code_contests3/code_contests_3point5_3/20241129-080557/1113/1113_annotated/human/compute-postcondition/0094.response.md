Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty. If the first element in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the updated string with '1' appended to it. If the first element in `row` is not '9', the program retains the initial state without any changes.***
