According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. If the `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element after the last element in the updated `row`, and `nRow` is an empty string do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `row` is not empty, `i` is the first element in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty**
