Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains '1' if the last element in the updated `row` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i`. The state of the program variables remains the same after the execution of the if else block.***
