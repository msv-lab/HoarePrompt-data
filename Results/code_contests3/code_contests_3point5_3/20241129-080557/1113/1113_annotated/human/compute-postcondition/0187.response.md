Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters and modifies input strings by replacing '9's with '1's. It reads input values, performs the modification, and then outputs the modified strings. However, the annotations mention postconditions that are not fully reflected in the code. The function does not handle any return values explicitly.**
