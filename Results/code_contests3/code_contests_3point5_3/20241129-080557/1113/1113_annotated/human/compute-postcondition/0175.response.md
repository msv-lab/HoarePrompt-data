Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, and `i` is 10. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the value `i` appended to its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` contains the value of `i` appended to its previous value**
