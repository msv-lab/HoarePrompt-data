According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should not exceed the range limit of 9.
