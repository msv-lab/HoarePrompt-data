Example Answer: 
The `input` function is reassigned to read from a `BytesIO` object containing the standard input. The lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` on program exit. The standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and the lambda function is registered for writing the value of `sys.stdout` on program exit.
Output State: **Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, `input` function is reassigned to read from a `BytesIO` object, and lambda function is registered for writing the value of `sys.stdout` on program exit.**
