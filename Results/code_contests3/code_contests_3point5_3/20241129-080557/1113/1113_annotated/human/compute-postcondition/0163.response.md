Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The contents of `nRow` are determined by replacing any '9's in `row` with '1's. If no '9's are present, then `nRow` remains the same as `row`. The variables `maxint`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications.**
