Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time the next element in `row` should be considered and `nRow` should be updated accordingly based on the value of `i`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
