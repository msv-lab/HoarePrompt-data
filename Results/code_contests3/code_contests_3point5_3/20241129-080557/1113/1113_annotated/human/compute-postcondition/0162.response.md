Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications. If `row` contains any '9's, they will be replaced by '1's in `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` will remain the same as `row` after all iterations of the loop.**
