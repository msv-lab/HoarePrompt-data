Example Answer:
The `row` variable is assigned the value of the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The other variables remain the same and are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces**
