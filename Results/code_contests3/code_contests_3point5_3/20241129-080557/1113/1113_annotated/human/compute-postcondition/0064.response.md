Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all iterations of the loop. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` will have '1' appended at the end. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`.**
