Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 9 (increased by 1), `row` contains the string input after stripping any leading and trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 9 (increased by 1), `row` contains the string input after stripping any leading and trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string**
