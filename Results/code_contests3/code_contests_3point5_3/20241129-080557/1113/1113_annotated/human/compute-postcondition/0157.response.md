Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications. If `i` equals '9', `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated after each iteration of the loop by incrementing `i` to the next character in `row`. In the else part, `nRow` is updated based on the concatenation of the character at index `i` from `row`.***
