Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 8 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left for the next iteration. If i == '9', `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. Otherwise, `nRow` is 8.***
