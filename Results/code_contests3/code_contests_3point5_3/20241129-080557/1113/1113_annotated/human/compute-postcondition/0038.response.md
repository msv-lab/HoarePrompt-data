Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the new value of `i`, which is the next element in `row`. Since `nRow` initially contained '1', after appending `i`, it will contain '1i'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is a string containing '1i'.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is a string containing '1i'**
