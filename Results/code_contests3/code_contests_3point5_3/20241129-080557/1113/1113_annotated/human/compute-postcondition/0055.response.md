According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the variables `i` and `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
`maxint` is assigned positive infinity
`res` contains the updated `nRow`
`T` is positive
`t` is 0
`i` is the last element in the updated `row`
`row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces
`nRow` is not empty
`row` is not empty

Now, for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` should contain the updated string with '1' appended at the end.
- If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` should be appended with the value of `i`.

State: **`maxint` is assigned positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` is not empty, and `row` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` contains the updated string with '1' appended at the end. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.**
