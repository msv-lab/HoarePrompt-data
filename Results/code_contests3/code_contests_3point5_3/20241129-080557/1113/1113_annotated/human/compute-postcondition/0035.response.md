Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is a string containing '1' for the loop to execute. If the value of `i` is equal to '9', the loop executes with no changes. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of `i` appended to its previous value for the loop to continue.***
