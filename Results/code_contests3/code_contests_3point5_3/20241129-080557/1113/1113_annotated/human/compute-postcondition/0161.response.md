Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string incremented by 1, `row` contains the original string before modifications. If i == '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If i is not equal to '9', no changes are made to `nRow`.***
