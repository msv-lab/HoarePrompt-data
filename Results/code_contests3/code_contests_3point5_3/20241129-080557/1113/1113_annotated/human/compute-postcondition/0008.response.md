According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `9`. Since `i` is the only variable that directly determines the loop execution, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range of `9` for the loop to execute.

State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is positive and `i` is 0 to 8**
