According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `row` still has more elements after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` has the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` has more elements. If `i` is '9', the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` has the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` still has more elements after the last iteration, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
