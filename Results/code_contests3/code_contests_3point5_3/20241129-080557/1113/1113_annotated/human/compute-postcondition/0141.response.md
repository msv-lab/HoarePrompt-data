Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is added to `nRow`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so the final value of `nRow` cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` should not be equal to the last character in the `row` string, the final value of `nRow` is dependent on the initial values of `nRow` and `i`.
Output State: **`i` should not be equal to the last character in the `row` string, the final value of `nRow` is dependent on the initial values of `nRow` and `i`**
