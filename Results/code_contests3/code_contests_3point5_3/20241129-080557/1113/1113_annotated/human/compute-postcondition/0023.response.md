Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 8. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 8 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left for the next iteration, `nRow` is 8.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is positive, `t` is 0, `i` is 8 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable object with more elements left for the next iteration, `nRow` is 8**
