According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 9 times. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications. 
To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` is 9 (increased by 1), `row` contains the original string before modifications**
