According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is 8 (the last element in `row`), `row` is empty, and `res` has `nRow` appended to it if the last element in `row` is '9'.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is empty, `res` has `nRow` appended to it if the last element in `row` is '9'**
