Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string with the next element to be processed, `res` has `nRow` appended to it if the last element in `row` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1' if the next element is '9', and `nRow` is '9' if the next element is not '9'. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is incremented by 1 in both cases.***
