According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are elements left in the `row` list. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains '1' if the last element in the updated `row` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final updated `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 1, `i` is the last element in the updated `row`, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains '1' if the last element in the updated `row` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` contains the concatenation of its previous value with the value of `i` for the next iteration**.
