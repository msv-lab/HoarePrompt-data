According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the `row` string. Before the loop starts, the `row` is assigned the input string after stripping whitespace, so the loop will execute. The variables `i` is 9 which represents the last character in the `row` string at the end of the loop. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should represent the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, and `nRow` should be updated to contain the final modified `nRow` after each iteration. 
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `T` is positive, `t` is 2, `i` represents the index of the last character in the modified `row` string, `row` contains the original string before modifications, `nRow` is updated after each iteration of the loop, `row` is a non-empty string with whitespace stripped**
