Example Answer:
n and m are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string using the map function. As the values of n and m are within the specified range, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
