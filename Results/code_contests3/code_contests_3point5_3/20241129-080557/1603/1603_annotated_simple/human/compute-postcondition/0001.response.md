Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a string consisting of '10' repeated n//2 times and '1' added at the end if n is odd. Given that n and m are integers between 1 and 1000, the output will be a string with '10' repeated n//2 times and '1' added at the end if n is odd.
Output State: **The output is a string with '10' repeated n//2 times and '1' added at the end if n is odd**
