Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The program simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times and appends a '1' at the end if n is odd. This does not ensure that the sum of beauties of all segments is maximum possible as required by the problem description. The program does not consider the input values m or the segments [l_i, r_i] at all. Therefore, the program does not solve the given problem correctly.
