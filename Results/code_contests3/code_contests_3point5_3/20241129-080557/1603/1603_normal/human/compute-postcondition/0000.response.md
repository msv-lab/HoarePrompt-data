Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input after splitting them**.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values from the input after splitting them**
