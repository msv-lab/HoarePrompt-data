Example Answer:
The code snippet prints '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd. The values of n and m are assigned from the input after splitting them. Therefore, the output state is: n and m are assigned values from the input after splitting them.
Output State: **n and m are assigned values from the input after splitting them**
