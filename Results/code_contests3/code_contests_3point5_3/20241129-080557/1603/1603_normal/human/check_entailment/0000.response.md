Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then prints a string consisting of '10' repeated `n/2` times followed by '1' if `n` is odd. This approach ensures that Sonya can put roses and lilies in such a way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible, as described in the problem. Additionally, the output hints align with the code's functionality and confirm that the code is correctly implementing the specified logic.
