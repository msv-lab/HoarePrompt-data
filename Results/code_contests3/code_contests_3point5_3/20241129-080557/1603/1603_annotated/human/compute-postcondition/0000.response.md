Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the values of `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, after execution, `n` and `m` will hold valid integer values within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^3, `m` is a non-negative integer within the range 1 <= m <= 10^3**
