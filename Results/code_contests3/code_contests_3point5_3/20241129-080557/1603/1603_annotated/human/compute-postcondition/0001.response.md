Example Answer: 
The code prints '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' if n is odd. Since n is a non-negative integer within the range 1 <= n <= 10^3, the output will be '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd.
Output State: **Output will be '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd**
