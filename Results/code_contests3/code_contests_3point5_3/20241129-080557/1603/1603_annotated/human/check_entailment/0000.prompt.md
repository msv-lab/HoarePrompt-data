You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.

There are n flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the i-th position. Thus each of n positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.

She knows that exactly m people will visit this exhibition. The i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.

Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n, m≤ 10^3) — the number of flowers and visitors respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1≤ l_i≤ r_i≤ n), meaning that i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive.

Output

Print the string of n characters. The i-th symbol should be «0» if you want to put a rose in the i-th position, otherwise «1» if you want to put a lily.

If there are multiple answers, print any.

Examples

Input

5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5


Output

01100

Input

6 3
5 6
1 4
4 6


Output

110010

Note

In the first example, Sonya can put roses in the first, fourth, and fifth positions, and lilies in the second and third positions;

  * in the segment [1…3], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…4], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…5], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4. 



The total beauty is equal to 2+2+4=8.

In the second example, Sonya can put roses in the third, fourth, and sixth positions, and lilies in the first, second, and fifth positions;

  * in the segment [5…6], there are one rose and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 1=1; 
  * in the segment [1…4], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4; 
  * in the segment [4…6], there are two roses and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 1=2. 



The total beauty is equal to 1+4+2=7.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3. Each segment defined by l_i and r_i contains only valid indices within the range of flowers (1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n).**
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print('10' * (n // 2) + ('1' if n & 1 else ''))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the input and prints a string based on the value of `n`. It constructs a string by repeating '10' `(n // 2)` times and appending '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not explicitly return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
