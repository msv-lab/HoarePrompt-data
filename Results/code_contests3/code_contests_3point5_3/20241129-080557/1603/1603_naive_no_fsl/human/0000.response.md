Correctness: False

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It simply alternates between '1' and '0' without considering the constraints that each visitor will visit a specific segment of flowers. This means that the beauty of each segment is not being optimized as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
