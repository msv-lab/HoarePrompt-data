Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`, but the initial state of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-3` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-2`; `ans` value depends on the initial value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-3` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-2`; `ans` value depends on the initial value of `i`**
