According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `c`. If the condition mentioned in the loop body is not met, the loop breaks. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2 and `c` contains valid integers. If the element at index `n-2` in `c` is not equal to the element at index `n-1`, `ans` is set to `n-1` and the loop breaks. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition mentioned above must not be met, meaning the element at index `n-2` must be equal to the element at index `n-1`.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-2` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-1`**
