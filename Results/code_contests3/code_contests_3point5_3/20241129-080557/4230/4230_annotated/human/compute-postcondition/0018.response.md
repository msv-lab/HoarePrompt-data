Example Answer:
`ans` is printed, which is either the index of the first occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]` or remains 0 if all elements in `c` are equal. The value of `n` and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers**
