Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous values of `i` and `ans` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-2` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-1`, and `ans` is an unknown value.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-2` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-1`, `ans` is an unknown value**
