Example Answer: 
The map function applies the int function to each element of the input list obtained by splitting the raw input. Since the initial state assigns the value of the first element of the list to `n`, the value of `n` will not change as a result of this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, and `c` is a map object containing the integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, `c` is a map object containing the integers obtained from the input**
