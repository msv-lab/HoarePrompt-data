Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input values split by spaces. The sequence of opened doors is stored in `n`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
