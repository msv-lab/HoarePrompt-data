Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, `c` is a map object containing the integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list, `c` is a map object containing the integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 0**
