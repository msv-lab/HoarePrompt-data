According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `c`. If `n` is at least 1 and the element at index `n-2` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `c` contains valid integers, and the element at index `n-2` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-1`. Since the loop is iterating from `n-2` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be at least 3, and the element at index `n-3` should be equal to the element at index `n-2`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` contains valid integers, the element at index `n-3` in `c` is equal to the element at index `n-2`**
