Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `c`. It then iterates through the list `c` in reverse order, and if it finds two consecutive elements that are not equal, it sets `ans` to the index of the first occurrence and breaks the loop. It prints the final value of `ans`, which indicates the position where the elements changed. If all elements in `c` are equal, `ans` remains 0. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
