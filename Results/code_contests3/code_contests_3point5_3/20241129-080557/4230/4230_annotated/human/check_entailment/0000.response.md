Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the list of opened doors in reverse order, and as soon as it finds two consecutive doors that are located in different exits, it updates the answer to the index of the first door and breaks out of the loop. This index indicates the position where Mr. Black can exit the house after opening that door.

The program handles all possible cases where Mr. Black can exit the house based on the sequence of opened doors, as described in the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
