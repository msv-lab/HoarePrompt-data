Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. It fails to consider the scenario where Mr. Black can exit the house after opening all the doors in one exit. For example, in the case where all doors are opened in the left exit first, the program would not output the correct result as it only checks for changes in door locations. 

Thus, the program needs to be updated to consider the condition where all doors in one exit are opened before the other exit.
