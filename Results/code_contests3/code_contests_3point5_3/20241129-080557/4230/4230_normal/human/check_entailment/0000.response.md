Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the input regarding the doors opened by Mr. Black, where 0 represents a door in the left exit and 1 represents a door in the right exit. It then iterates through the sequence of doors and finds the last index where the door direction changes. This index is stored in the variable `ans` and is printed as the final output. 

The code accurately follows the problem description by determining the smallest index k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. It correctly handles scenarios where Mr. Black opens doors from both exits alternately, and identifies when Mr. Black can exit the house with the given sequence of opened doors. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not cover, and the output hints confirm the functionality of the code.
