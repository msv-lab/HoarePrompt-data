Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input data regarding the doors opened by Mr. Black, where 0 represents a door in the left exit and 1 represents a door in the right exit. It then iterates through the sequence of doors and finds the last index where the door direction changes. This index is stored in the variable `ans` and is printed as the final output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
