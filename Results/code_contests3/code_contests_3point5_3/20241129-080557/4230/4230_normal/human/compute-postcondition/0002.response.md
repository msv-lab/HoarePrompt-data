Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by space to an integer. The previous value of `n` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input.
Output State: **`n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input**
