Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`, `i` is decremented by 1, loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
