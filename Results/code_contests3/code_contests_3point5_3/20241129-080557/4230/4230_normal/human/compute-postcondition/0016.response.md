Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `i` is one less than the previous value, `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1], `ans` is one more than the previous value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
