According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and the conditions for updating `ans` and decrementing `i` have been met. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, and the values of `c` need to be such that `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1`.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `i` is one less than the previous value, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1] for the loop to execute one more time**.
