Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `ans` is 0**
