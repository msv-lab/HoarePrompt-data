Example Answer:
The `map` function is applied to convert the input sequence of integers into a list of integers. Since the input is read using `raw_input().split()`, the sequence of integers represents the doors opened by Mr. Black, where 0 indicates a door in the left exit and 1 indicates a door in the right exit. The variable `n` now holds a list of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black**
