According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 2. The loop iterates in reverse from `n - 2` down to 0. Before the loop starts, `n` being the first door opened by Mr. Black does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 2, `i` starts at `n - 2`, and `c` remains a mapped list of integers from input. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `ans` is 0, `i` starts at `n - 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is greater than or equal to 0**
