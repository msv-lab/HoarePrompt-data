Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned to be the first element of the list `n`. Since `n` is a list of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, after execution, `n` will now hold the value of the first door opened. The rest of the list is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black.
Output State: **`n` is the first door opened by Mr. Black**
