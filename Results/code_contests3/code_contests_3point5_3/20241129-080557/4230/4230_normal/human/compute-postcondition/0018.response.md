Example Answer:
Initially, `n` is at least 2, and `c` is a list of integers from input. If there exists an index `i` such that `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` will be updated to the value of that index + 1. If no such index exists, `ans` will remain 0 at the end of the loop. The code simply prints the value of `ans` at the end of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, and the value of `ans` has been printed.**
