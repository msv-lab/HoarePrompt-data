Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`, `i` is decremented by 1. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1] in each iteration.***
