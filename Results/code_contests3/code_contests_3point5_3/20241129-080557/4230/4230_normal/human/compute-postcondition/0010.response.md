Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is one less than the previous value. Therefore, `ans` is one more than the previous value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a mapped list of integers from input, `i` is one less than the previous value, `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1] for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` is one more than the previous value of `i`**
