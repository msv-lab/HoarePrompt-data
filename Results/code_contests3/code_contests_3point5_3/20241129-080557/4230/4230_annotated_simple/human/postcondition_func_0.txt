The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `c` representing the doors opened by Mr. Black. It then iterates through the list `c` backwards and finds the index of the first occurrence where the value changes. If no change occurs, it sets the result `ans` to 0. The function finally prints the value of `ans`.
