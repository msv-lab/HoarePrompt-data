Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` was determined based on the index of the first occurrence where the value changes in the list `c`. If no such occurrence exists, `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a list of integers converted from the input list, `ans` is the index of the first occurrence where the value changes in the list `c`. If no such occurrence exists, `ans` remains 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a list of integers converted from the input list, `ans` is the index of the first occurrence where the value changes in the list `c`. If no such occurrence exists, `ans` remains 0**.
