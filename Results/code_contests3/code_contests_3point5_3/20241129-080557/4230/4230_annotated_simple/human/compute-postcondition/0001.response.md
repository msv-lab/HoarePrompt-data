Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `n`. If `n` is a list of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, then after execution, `n` will now be the first element of that list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is now the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black.
Output State: **n is now the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black**
