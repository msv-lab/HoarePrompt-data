Example Answer:
The map function is used to convert each element in the input list to an integer. Since `n` is the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, after executing the code, `c` will contain the list of integers converted from the input list. 
Output State: **`n` is now the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a list of integers converted from the input list**
