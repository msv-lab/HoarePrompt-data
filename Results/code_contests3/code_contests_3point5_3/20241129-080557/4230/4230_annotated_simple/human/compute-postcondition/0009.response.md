According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 2`, and the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Since we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is decremented by 1.
State: **`n` is the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a list of integers converted from the input list, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is at least 3, and `i` is `n - 3`. The element at index `i - 1` is not equal to the element at index `i`**
