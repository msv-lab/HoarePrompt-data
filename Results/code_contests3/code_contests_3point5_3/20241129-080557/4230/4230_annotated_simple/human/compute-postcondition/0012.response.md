Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the list representing the doors opened by Mr. Black, `c` is a list of integers converted from the input list, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and the element at index `i - 1` is not equal to the element at index `i`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
