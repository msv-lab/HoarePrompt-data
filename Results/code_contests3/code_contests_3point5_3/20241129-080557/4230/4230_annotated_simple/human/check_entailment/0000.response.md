Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, iterates through the sequence of opened doors, and finds the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors. The program then prints this index.

The program checks for the first occurrence where there is a change in the exit (left or right) of the doors that Mr. Black opens. This change indicates that Mr. Black can exit the house from one of the exits. The program correctly identifies this index and prints it.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input cases.
