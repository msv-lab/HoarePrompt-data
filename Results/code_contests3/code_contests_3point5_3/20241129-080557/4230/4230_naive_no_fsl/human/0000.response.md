Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly finds the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and checks if the door at index i is in a different exit than the door at index i+1. If it finds such a door, it updates the answer to be i+1.

The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
