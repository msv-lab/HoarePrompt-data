Correctness: **False**

The given program does not match the problem description. The `func_2` function is trying to read input values from the user using `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python. Additionally, the logic inside the `func_2` function does not align with the problem description of fighting monsters and calculating the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an attack before winning. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description.
