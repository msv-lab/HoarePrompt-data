Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description. The functions described in the annotations do not match the problem description at all. The functions do not relate to the task of Fennec fighting monsters and calculating the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. Additionally, the functions do not handle the input format described in the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not address the requirements of the problem description.
