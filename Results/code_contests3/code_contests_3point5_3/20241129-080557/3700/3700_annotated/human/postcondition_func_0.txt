The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `c`. If the value of `c` is greater than or equal to the integer `mod`, it updates `c` to be the remainder when divided by `mod`. The function then returns the updated value of `c`. The functionality of the function is to perform this arithmetic operation and return the final value of `c`, possibly adjusted to be the remainder when divided by `mod`.
