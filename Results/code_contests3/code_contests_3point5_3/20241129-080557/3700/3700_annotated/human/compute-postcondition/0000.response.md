Example Answer: 
`H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `H` and `N` are unknown at this point, but they are integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= `K` <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` are integers such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= `K` <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` are integers such that 1 <= `H_i` <= 10^9.**
