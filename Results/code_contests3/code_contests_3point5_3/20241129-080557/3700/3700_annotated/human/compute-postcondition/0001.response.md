Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of a list created by parsing the input string into integers. The sum is then assigned to variable `s`. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are integers, `H_i` are integers, `s` is the sum of integers parsed from input.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers, `H_i` are integers, `s` is the sum of integers parsed from input**
