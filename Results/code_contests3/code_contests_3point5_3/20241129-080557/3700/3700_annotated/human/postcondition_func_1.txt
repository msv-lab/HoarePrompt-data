The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from the input, calculates the sum `s` of `N` integers also read from the input, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value. However, the code does not handle any exceptions or edge cases like invalid inputs or out-of-range values.
