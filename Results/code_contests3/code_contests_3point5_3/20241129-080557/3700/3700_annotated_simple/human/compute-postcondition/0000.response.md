Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input based on spaces. The values of `H` and `N` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is a value based on input, `N` is a value based on input.
Output State: **`H` is a value based on input, `N` is a value based on input**
