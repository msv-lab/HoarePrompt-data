Functionality: **The function func_2 reads two integers `H` and `N` from user input and calculates the sum `s` of `N` integers entered by the user. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a predefined string output based on the comparison of `s` and `H`.**
