Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer, `N` is an integer, `s` is the sum of integers obtained from user input. If the sum of integers `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, the program prints 'Yes'. If the sum of integers `s` is less than `H`, the program prints 'No' and does not affect the initial state variables.***
