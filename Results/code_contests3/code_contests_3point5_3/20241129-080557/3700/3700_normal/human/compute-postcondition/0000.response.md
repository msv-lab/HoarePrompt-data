Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values by splitting the input. The values of `H` and `N` are integers read from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is assigned an integer value, `N` is assigned an integer value.
Output State: **`H` is assigned an integer value, `N` is assigned an integer value**
