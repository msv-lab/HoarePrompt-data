The code calculates the sum of integers obtained from user input. The sum is assigned to variable `s`. The previous values of `H` and `N` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`H` is assigned an integer value, `N` is assigned an integer value, `s` is the sum of integers obtained from user input**
