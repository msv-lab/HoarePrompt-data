The function `func` reads input from the user consisting of two lowercase English letters, calculates the number of combinations that satisfy a specific condition based on the values of these letters, and prints the result. If the integer value of the first letter is equal to the integer value of the second letter, the initial value of `ans` is set to 1. Then, for each integer between the values of the letters, it checks if the first and fifth digits are equal and if the second and fourth digits are equal in the integer representation. If so, it increments `ans` accordingly. The final value of `ans` is printed as the output. The function does not explicitly return any value.
