Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. There are no other variables affected in this snippet of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1**
