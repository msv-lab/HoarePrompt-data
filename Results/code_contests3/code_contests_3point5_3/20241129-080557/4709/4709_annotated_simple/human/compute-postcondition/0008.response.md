According to the code, the loop will execute if the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`. If `A` is equal to `B`, `ans` is updated to 1 before the loop starts. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `A` needs to be less than `B`.
State: **`A` is a lowercase English letter, `B` is a lowercase English letter such that the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B` for the loop to execute. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, `ans` is updated to 1**
