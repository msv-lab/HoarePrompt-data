Postcondition: ***`A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `A` should be less than `B`, `C` is a list containing the string representation of the integer `i`. If `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]`, then `A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `A` should be less than `B`, `C` is a list containing the string representation of the integer `i`.***
