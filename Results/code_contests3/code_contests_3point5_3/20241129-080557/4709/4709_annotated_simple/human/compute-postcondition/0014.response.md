Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the value of `str(i)` where `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, the value of `C` depends on `i`, which is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` and `B` are lowercase English letters; for the loop to execute one more time `A` is the next letter in the alphabet and `B` remains the same.
Output State: **`A` and `B` are lowercase English letters; for the loop to execute one more time `A` is the next letter in the alphabet and `B` remains the same**
