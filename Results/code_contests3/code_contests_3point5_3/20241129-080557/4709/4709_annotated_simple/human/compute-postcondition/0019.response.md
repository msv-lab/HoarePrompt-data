Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` is unknown. The states of `A`, `B`, and `C` remain the same. The loop condition `A` < `B` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `A` should be less than `B`, `C` is a list containing the string representation of the integer `i`.
Output State: **`A` is the next letter in the alphabet, `B` remains the same, `ans` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `A` should be less than `B`, `C` is a list containing the string representation of the integer `i`**
