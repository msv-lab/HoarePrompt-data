Postcondition: ***`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of 3 lists with the letters of a row, `A` and `B` are valid indices within the grid `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if the integer representation of list A is less than the integer representation of list B. `C` is a list containing the string representation of integer `i`, where `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3`. The integer representation of list B is greater than the integer representation of list A. `C` continues to satisfy the specified conditions. `C` is a list containing the string representation of integer `i`***
