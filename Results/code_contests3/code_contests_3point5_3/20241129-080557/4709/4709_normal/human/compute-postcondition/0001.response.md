Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of splitting the grid `a` based on whitespace. Since `a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, after splitting, `l` will be a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of a row. 
Output State: **`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of a row**.
