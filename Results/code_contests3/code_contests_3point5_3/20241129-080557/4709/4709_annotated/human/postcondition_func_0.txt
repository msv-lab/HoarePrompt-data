The function `func` reads a string input containing two lowercase English letters, splits the input, assigns the letters to variables `A` and `B`, and initializes a variable `ans` to 0. It then checks if `A` is equal to `B`, setting `ans` to 1 if true. Next, it iterates over a range defined by converting `A` and `B` to integers, counts the numbers where the first and last digits are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal, and stores the total count in `ans`. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
