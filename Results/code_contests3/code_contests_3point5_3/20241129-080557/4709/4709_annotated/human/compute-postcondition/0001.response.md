Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the list of words obtained by splitting the string `a`. Since `a` consists of lowercase English letters, after splitting it, `l` will contain individual lowercase English letters as elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` consists of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`a` consists of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of lowercase English letters**
