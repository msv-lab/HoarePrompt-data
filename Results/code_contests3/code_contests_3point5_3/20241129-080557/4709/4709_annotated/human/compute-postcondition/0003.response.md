Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the second element of list `l`, which is indexed by 1. The first element of list `l` is `A`, so `B` is assigned the value of `A`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` consists of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of lowercase English letters, `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is equal to `A`.
Output State: **`a` consists of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of lowercase English letters, `A` is the first element of list `l`, `B` is equal to `A`**
