Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book before the given number of days. If Luba finishes reading before the end of the n days, the program will not output the correct result. In such a scenario, the program should output the day on which Luba finishes reading, not the total number of days given as input. 

For example, if the input is:
```
2 2
86400 0
```
The correct output should be 2 since Luba finishes reading on the second day, not on the first day. However, the program will output 1 in this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
