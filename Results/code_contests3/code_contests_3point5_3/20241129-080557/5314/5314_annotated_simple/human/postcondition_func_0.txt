The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `t`, and a list `a` where `n` and `t` are positive integers within specific ranges and `a` contains non-negative integers. It then iterates over the elements in `a` subtracting each element from `86400` until `t` becomes less than 0. The function prints the number of successful iterations `i`. However, there is a missing return value in the function, and it does not handle the case where `t` becomes negative before iterating through all elements in `a`.
