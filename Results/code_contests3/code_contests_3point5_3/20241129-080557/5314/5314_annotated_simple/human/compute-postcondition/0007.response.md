Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 from itself and adding the integer value of `a[i]`. The loop will execute again only if `t` is greater than 0. The previous values of `t` and `a[i]` are unknown, so the output state is: `i` is increased by 1, `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
