Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input separated by spaces. The values entered are stored as elements in list `a`. The previous values of `n` and `t` are unknown, so the output state is: n and t are positive integers within the specified ranges, a is a list containing input values.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers within the specified ranges, a is a list containing input values**
