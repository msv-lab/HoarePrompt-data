Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous values of `i` and `t` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is increased by 1, `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`**
