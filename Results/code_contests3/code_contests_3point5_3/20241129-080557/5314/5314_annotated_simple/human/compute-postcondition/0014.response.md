The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes the values of n, t, and the list ai, where n and t are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, and the list ai contains n non-negative integers each within the range 0 <= ai <= 86400. The function performs a specific operation or computation on these input values but does not return any specific output.
