Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(i)` simply prints the value of `i`. Since `i` represents the number of times the loop executed successfully, and the loop terminates when `t` becomes less than 0, the value of `i` at this point signifies the number of successful iterations before the loop terminates. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully.
Output State: **`i` is the number of times the loop executed successfully**
