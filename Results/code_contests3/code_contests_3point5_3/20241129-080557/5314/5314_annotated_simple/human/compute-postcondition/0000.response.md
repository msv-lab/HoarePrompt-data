Example Answer:
n and t are assigned values by mapping the input to integers. The values of n and t are within the specified ranges. The initial state is n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers within the specified ranges**
