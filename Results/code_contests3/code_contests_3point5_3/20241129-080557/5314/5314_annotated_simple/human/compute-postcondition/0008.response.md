Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since we do not have the initial values of `t` and `a`, we cannot determine the exact output state.
Output State: **Cannot determine the exact output state without initial values of `t` and `a`.**
