Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the given problem. The main issue lies in the loop condition and how the time remaining to read the book is calculated. The program subtracts the time Luba spends working each day from 86400, but it should be subtracted from `t` instead. Additionally, the loop should stop when `t` becomes less than or equal to 0, not when it becomes equal to 0.

As a result, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of days Luba needs to finish reading the book.
