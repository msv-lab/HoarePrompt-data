According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 86400 - int(a[i]). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` should be greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i]). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 1, `t` is decremented by 86400 - int(a[i]), for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i])**
