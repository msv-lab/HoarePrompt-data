According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, and `i` is 0. Since `t` is the only condition to determine the loop execution, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
