Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i]), where `a[i]` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day. The loop is set to execute again if `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i]), `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i]), `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
