Example Answer:
The `raw_input().split()` function takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since the initial state mentions n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, and ai is a non-negative integer, we can assume the input provided by the user will be in the correct format. After splitting the input, the list `a` will contain the values entered by the user. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of days, t is a positive integer representing the time required to read the book, ai is a non-negative integer representing the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, a is a list containing the input values**.
