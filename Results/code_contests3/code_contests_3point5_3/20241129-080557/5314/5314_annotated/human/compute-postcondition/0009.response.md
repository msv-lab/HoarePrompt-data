According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i]), `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 86400 - int(a[i]), `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
