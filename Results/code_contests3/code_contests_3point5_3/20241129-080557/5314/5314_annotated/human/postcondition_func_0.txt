The function `func` reads input values for the number of days `n`, the time required to read the book `t`, and the time Luba spends on work each day `ai`. It then iterates over the list `a` containing Luba's work times for each day, subtracting the time spent on work from the available time `t` until `t` becomes less than the difference between 86400 and the work time on a particular day. The function prints the number of days `i` for which the time spent on work exceeds the available time. The function does not have an explicit return value and focuses on iterating through the work times and tracking the number of days exceeding the available time.
