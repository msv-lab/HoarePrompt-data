Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program simply subtracts the time spent on work each day from the total time required to read the book until the remaining time is less than the difference between 86400 and the work time on a particular day. This approach does not guarantee the correct solution to the problem of finding the minimum day when Luba finishes reading the book.

To solve the given problem, the program should keep track of the total time spent on work for each day and compare it with the total time required to read the book. The program should find the minimum day when the total time spent on work is less than the total time required to read the book.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
