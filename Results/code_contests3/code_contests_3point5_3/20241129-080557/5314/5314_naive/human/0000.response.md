Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and iterates through the days while deducting the time spent working on each day. It stops iterating when the remaining time to read the book becomes zero or negative. The program then prints the day on which Luba finishes reading the book. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases.
