According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. So, for the loop to execute the first time, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 0**
