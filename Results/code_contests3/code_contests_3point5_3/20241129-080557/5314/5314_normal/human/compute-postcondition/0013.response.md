Example Answer:
The program prints the total number of elements in the list 'a', which is stored in variable 'i'. The value of 'i' is already assigned, so the output state is: 'n' and 't' are positive integers within the specified ranges, 'a' is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, 'i' is equal to the total number of elements in 'a', 't' is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **'n' and 't' are positive integers within the specified ranges, 'a' is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, 'i' is equal to the total number of elements in 'a', 't' is updated based on the calculation mentioned above**
