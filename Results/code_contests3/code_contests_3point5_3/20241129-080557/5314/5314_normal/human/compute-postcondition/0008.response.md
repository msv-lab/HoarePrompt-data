Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since the initial value of `i` is 1, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 2, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 2, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above**
