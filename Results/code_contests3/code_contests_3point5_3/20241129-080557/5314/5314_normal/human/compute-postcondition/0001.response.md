Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value returned by `raw_input().split()`. Since `n` and `t` are positive integers, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**
