Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the list returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it by spaces. The values of `n` and `t` are now determined based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
