Example Answer:
`t` is updated by subtracting 86400 minus the integer value at index `i` of list `a`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 1, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.**
