Example Answer:
`t` is subtracted by `86400 - int(a[i])`, where `a[i]` is converted to an integer. The previous values of `t`, `a`, and `i` are known. Therefore, after execution, `t` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 0, `t` is updated based on the calculation**
