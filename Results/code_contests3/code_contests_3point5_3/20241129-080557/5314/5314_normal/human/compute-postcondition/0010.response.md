Example Answer:
`t` is subtracted by the result of 86400 minus the integer value of `a[i]`. The loop will execute again if `t` is still greater than 0. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
