According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is positive.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
