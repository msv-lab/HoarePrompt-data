Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum time by which each trolleybus can reach the final station based on the given input parameters. The program considers the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance to the final station for each trolleybus and calculates the arrival time accordingly. The logic used in the program is in line with the problem description provided. Additionally, the program handles each trolleybus separately and updates the arrival time accordingly. Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided program logic, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
