Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where a trolleybus catches up with another one. This is a critical part of the problem description as trolleybuses are not allowed to overtake each other. The program should consider the scenario where a trolleybus catches up with another one and they travel together until the final station. The current implementation does not account for this scenario, making it incorrect.
