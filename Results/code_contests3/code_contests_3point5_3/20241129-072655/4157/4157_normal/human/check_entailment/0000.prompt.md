You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Output hints: The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation:The code originally looks correct. The function hints agree with the code and with their help we determine that the code indeed follows the problem description. the function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints: The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and not follow the problem description. We also see that the output hints agree with the code and they also help prove that the code is incorrect.  The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Output hints: The function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. If the taget is at the last index it wont be found as the loop will break before reaching the last index.

Example answer 3:
Explanation: Originnaly the code looks correct but after confirming that the output hints agree with the code,we can see the function returns the index of the target number in the input list `arr` if it is present; otherwise, it returns -1. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the target number in the list. However, the termination condition of the while loop is `left < right`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely when `left` is equal to `right`. This condition can lead to missing the target element if it is at the last index of the list. Also when left and right are adjacent then mid will always be left leading to infinate loop.
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.

A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of d meters from the depot. We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.

Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.

You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.

Input

The first input line contains three space-separated integers n, a, d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, d ≤ 106) — the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station, correspondingly.

Next n lines contain pairs of integers ti vi (0 ≤ t1 < t2... < tn - 1 < tn ≤ 106, 1 ≤ vi ≤ 106) — the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.

Output

For each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Examples

Input

3 10 10000
0 10
5 11
1000 1


Output

1000.5000000000
1000.5000000000
11000.0500000000


Input

1 2 26
28 29


Output

33.0990195136

Note

In the first sample the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one, that will happen at distance 510.5 meters from the depot. The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds.
Program:
```
import math

t = 0.0
(n, a, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
for i in xrange(n):
    (ti, v) = map(float, raw_input().split())
    t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
    t = max(t1 + ti, t)
    print(t)
```
Output hints: The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates `n` times to calculate `t1` based on the provided formulas. It finds the maximum value of `t1 + ti` in each iteration and prints it. The function does not have a specified return value. Edge cases and missing functionality include the requirement for the `math` module not being imported, and the absence of error handling for invalid inputs.

First I want you to try to see if the code does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The code must exactly follow the problem description for all cases to be correct.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
