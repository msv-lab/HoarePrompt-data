Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The code does not import the `math` module which is required for the `sqrt` function in the calculation of `t1`. This will lead to an error when trying to run the code.
2. The code does not handle invalid inputs such as negative values for `n`, `a`, or `d`.
3. The output hints mention the absence of error handling for invalid inputs, which is indeed missing in the code.
4. The code calculates `t1` based on the provided formulas, but there is a possibility of incorrect calculations due to the missing `math` module and potential errors in the formula itself. 
5. Overall, the code does not completely follow the problem description due to the issues mentioned above.
