Example Answer:
The variable `t` is assigned the value `0.0`. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `a`, and `d` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= a, d <= 10^6. Each trolleybus's time ti and maximum speed vi are integers such that 0 <= t1 < t2 < ... < tn-1 < tn <= 10^6, 1 <= vi <= 10^6; `t` is 0.0.
