Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `t`. Since there are no changes to `t`, `i`, `n`, `ti`, or `v`, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the comparison between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ti` and `v` have float values from input splitting**
