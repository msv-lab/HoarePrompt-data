Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values of `float` converted inputs using `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The initial state `t` is printed, and for the loop to execute another time, `i` should be increased by 1, but the value of `i` is not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
