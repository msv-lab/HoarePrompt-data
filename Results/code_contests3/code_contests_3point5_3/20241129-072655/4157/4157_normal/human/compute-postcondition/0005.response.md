Example Answer:
`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The comparison is based on the calculated values of `t1` and `ti`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated based on the comparison between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ti` and `v` have float values from input splitting.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the comparison between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ti` and `v` have float values from input splitting**
