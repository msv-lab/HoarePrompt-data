The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates `n` times to calculate `t1` based on the provided formulas. It finds the maximum value of `t1 + ti` in each iteration and prints it. The function does not have a specified return value. Edge cases and missing functionality include the requirement for the `math` module not being imported, and the absence of error handling for invalid inputs.
