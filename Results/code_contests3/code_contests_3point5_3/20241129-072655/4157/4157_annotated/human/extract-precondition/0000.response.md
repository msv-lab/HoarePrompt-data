**Precondition**: 
- n is the number of trolleybuses, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.
- a is the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6.
- d is the distance from the depot to the final station, where 1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6.
- For each trolleybus i (1 ≤ i ≤ n):
    - ti is the time when the trolleybus leaves the depot, where 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn - 1 < tn ≤ 10^6.
    - vi is the maximum speed of the trolleybus, where 1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6.
