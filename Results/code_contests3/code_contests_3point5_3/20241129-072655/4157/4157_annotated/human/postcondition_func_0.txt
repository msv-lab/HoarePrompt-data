Functionality: The function `func` reads input for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance from the depot to the final station. Then, for each trolleybus, it calculates the time required to reach the final station using the given formulas and updates the maximum time taken. The function prints this maximum time for each trolleybus. However, the function lacks a clear output or return value, which might be an oversight in the annotations.
