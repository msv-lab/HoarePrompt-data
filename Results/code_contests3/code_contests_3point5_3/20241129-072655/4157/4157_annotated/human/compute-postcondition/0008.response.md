Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values extracted from the input using `map` and `split`. The values of `ti` and `v` are now updated based on the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute again, `ti` is a float, and `v` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute again, `ti` is a float, and `v` is a float**
