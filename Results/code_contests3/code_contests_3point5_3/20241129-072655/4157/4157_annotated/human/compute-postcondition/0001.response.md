Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values based on the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state only specifies `t` as 0.0, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input**
