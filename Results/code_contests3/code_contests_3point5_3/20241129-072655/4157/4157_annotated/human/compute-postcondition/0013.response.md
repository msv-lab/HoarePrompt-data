Example Answer: 
The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned by mapping the input values to float. The `t` and `i` variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
