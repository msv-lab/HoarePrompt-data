According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` needs to be updated based on the current values of `t1`, `ti`, and the previous value of `t`. Additionally, `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
