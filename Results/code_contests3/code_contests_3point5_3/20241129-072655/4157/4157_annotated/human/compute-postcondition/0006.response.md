Example Answer:
`t` is printed, which is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The output will be the current value of `t`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
