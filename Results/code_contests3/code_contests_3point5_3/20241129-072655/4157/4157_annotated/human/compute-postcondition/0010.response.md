Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. Since `ti` and `t1` are floats, the new value of `t` will be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the current `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`**
