Example Answer:
The value of `t1` is calculated based on the conditions provided. The value of `v`, `a`, and `d` is needed for the calculation of `t1`. However, since these values are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `t1`. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
