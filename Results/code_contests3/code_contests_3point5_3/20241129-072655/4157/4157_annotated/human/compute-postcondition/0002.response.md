According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` have integer values assigned, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
