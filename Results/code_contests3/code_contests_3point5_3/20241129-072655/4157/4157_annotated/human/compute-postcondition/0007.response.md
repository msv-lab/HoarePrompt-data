According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t`, `t1`, `ti`, and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` needs to be updated based on the new values of `t1` and `ti`.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute again**
