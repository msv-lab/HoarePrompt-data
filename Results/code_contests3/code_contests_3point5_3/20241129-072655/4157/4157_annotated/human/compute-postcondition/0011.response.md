Example Answer:
The value of `t` is printed. The value of `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Since we do not have the values of `t1`, `ti`, and the previous value of `t`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`**
