Example Answer:
The value of `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Since we do not have the initial values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
