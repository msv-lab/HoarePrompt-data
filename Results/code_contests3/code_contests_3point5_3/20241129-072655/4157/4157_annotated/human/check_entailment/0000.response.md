Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance from the depot to the final station. For each trolleybus, it calculates the time required to reach the final station using the given formulas and updates the maximum time taken. The function then prints this maximum time for each trolleybus. The program ensures that trolleybuses do not overtake each other and calculates the arrival time accurately based on the physics principles described in the problem description.
