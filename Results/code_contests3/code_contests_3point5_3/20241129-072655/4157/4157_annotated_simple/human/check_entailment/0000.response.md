Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given constraints. It uses the physics formula for calculating time with acceleration to determine the arrival time for each trolleybus. The program iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the arrival time, and updates the maximum arrival time `t`. Finally, it prints the arrival time for each trolleybus in the order they were given in the input.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately calculates the arrival times for each trolleybus based on their acceleration, maximum speed, and distance to the final station.
