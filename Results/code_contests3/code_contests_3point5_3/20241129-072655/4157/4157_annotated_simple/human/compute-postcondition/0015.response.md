Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated based on the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `t`. This means that `t` will be assigned the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `t1` and `ti` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated based on the maximum between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
