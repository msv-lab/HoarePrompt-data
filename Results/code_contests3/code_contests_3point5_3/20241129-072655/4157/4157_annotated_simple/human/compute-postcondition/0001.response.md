Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, `d` are assigned by mapping the input values to integers obtained from the `raw_input().split()` function. The previous value of `t` is 0.0, and since it is not affected by the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, `d` are assigned new integer values based on user input**
