Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes an input and splits it, and `map(float, ...)` converts the input values to floats. The values of `ti` and `v` are dependent on the input provided. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `i` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is printed, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than `i+1`.
Output State: **`t` is printed, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than `i+1`**
