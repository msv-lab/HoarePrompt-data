#State of the program right berfore the function call: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.**
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers from input, divides the first number by the second number, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It assumes that the input consists of two space-separated floating-point numbers.
