Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`. The output state will be based on the initial state of the variables `T`, `X`, `t`, and `x`. Since no variable assignment is happening, the output state will remain the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; `t` and `x` are floats**
