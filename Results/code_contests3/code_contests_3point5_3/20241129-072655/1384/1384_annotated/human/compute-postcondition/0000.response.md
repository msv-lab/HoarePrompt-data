Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts space-separated inputs and `map(float, ...)` converts them to floats. The values of `T` and `X` are integers, so after execution, `t` and `x` are floats. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; `t` and `x` are floats.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; `t` and `x` are floats**
