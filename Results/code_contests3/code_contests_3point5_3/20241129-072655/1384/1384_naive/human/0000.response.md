Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program takes two integer inputs T and X, then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. The program performs the calculation as described in the problem statement and outputs the result. 

For all possible integer inputs within the given constraints, the program correctly calculates the hours that will pass in World A. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
