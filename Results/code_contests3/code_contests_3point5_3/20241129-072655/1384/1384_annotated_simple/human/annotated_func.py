#State of the program right berfore the function call: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.**
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers from the input and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second number. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
