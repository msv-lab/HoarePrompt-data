Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integer inputs, T and X, and then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. The use of the map(float, input().split()) function ensures that the inputs are converted to floating-point numbers for accurate division. The program then prints the result, which matches the expected output as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
