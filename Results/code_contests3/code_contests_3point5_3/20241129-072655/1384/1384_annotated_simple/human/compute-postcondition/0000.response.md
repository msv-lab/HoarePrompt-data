Example Answer:
The values of `t` and `x` are assigned by splitting the input into two parts and converting them to float. The values of `t` and `x` are unknown as they depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: T and X are floating-point numbers based on the input provided.
Output State: **T and X are floating-point numbers based on the input provided**
