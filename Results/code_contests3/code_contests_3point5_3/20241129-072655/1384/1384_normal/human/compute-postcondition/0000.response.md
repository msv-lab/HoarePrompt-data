Example Answer:
t and x are assigned the values of map(float, input().split()), where input accepts input values, split splits the input values, and float converts them to floating-point numbers. The values of T and X are integers, so after execution, t and x will be floating-point numbers. Therefore, the Output State is: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, t and x are floating-point numbers.
Output State: **T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, t and x are floating-point numbers**
