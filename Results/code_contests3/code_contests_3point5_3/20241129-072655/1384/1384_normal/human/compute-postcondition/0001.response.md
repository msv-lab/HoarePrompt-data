Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`, where `t` and `x` are floating-point numbers. The output state does not affect the initial state, so the Output State is: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, t and x are floating-point numbers.
Output State: **T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, t and x are floating-point numbers**
