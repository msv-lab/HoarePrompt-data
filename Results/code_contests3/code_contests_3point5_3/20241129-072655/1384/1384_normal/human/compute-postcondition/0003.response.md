Functionality: **The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input and prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read input values, perform a division operation, and print the result without any output.**
