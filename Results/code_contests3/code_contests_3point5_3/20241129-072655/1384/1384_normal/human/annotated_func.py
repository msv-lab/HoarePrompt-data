#State of the program right berfore the function call: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.**
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input and prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read input values, perform a division operation, and print the result without any output.
