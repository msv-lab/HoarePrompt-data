Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input, performs division operation `t / x`, and prints the result. This aligns perfectly with the problem description that states to calculate how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. The code handles all potential cases and edge cases mentioned in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality. Hence, the code is correct.
