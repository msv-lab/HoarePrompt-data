According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more words in the list `l` to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase string. For the loop to execute one more time, the next word in the list `l` should be assigned to `i`.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, m is 0, i is the next word in the list, s is 1, j is an uppercase string**
