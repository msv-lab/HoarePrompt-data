Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the maximum value of s among all words in list l. Since s represents the total count of uppercase letters in the last word in list l, printing m will output the maximum count of uppercase letters among all words in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is between 1 and 200, l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value of s among all words in list l, i is the last word in the list, s is the total count of uppercase letters in the last word in list l.
Output State: **n is between 1 and 200, l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value of s among all words in list l, i is the last word in the list, s is the total count of uppercase letters in the last word in list l**
