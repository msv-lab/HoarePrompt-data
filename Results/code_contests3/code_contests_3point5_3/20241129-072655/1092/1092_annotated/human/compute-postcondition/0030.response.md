Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`. Since `m` is calculated based on `s` and the previous value of `m`, the new value of `m` will be the maximum between the two. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+1) words with at least 1 word, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase words in the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+1) words with at least 1 word, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase words in the list `l`**
