Example Answer:
The input is taken as a single string and split into a list of words stored in variable `l`. The number of words in the input can be any value between 1 and 200. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200; l is a list of n words.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200; l is a list of n words**
