According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the condition that the last word in the list `j` is in uppercase. If the condition is met, the loop will execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+1) words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to the next word in the list.
- If the last word in the list `j` is in uppercase, the loop will execute again.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+1) words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, the next word in the list becomes `i`, `s` is 1, if the last word in the list `j` is in uppercase, the loop will execute another time**
