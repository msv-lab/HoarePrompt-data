Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value 0. The value of `m` is directly set to 0, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200; l is a list of n words; m is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200; l is a list of n words; m is 0**
