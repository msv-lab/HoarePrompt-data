Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is reset to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200, l is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, i is the last word in the list, s is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200, l is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, i is the last word in the list, s is 0**
