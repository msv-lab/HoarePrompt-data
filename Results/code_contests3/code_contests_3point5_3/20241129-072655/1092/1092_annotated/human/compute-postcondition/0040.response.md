According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If the loop can execute again, `j` will be updated to the next element in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+2) words with at least 1 word, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is an iterable object, `s` is the total number of uppercase words in the list `l`, `s` is 2, `j` is an uppercase word. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is updated to 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next element in `i`.
State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+2) words with at least 1 word, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is an iterable object, `s` is the total number of uppercase words in the list `l`, `s` is 2, the next value of `j` is the next element in `i**`.
