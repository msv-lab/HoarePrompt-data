Example Answer:
The code `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string. Since the input is not assigned to any variable, the program execution does not have any impact on the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200. The text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word contains only small and capital Latin letters.**
