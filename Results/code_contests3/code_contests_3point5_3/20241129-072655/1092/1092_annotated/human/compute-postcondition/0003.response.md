According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If the list l has at least 1 word, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, m is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, and i is the first word in the list.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, m is 0, for the loop to execute the first time i is the first word in the list**
