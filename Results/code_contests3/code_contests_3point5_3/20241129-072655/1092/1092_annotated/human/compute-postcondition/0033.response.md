According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is iterable, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is the second last word in the list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is an iterable object. 
State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `l` has (n+2) words with at least 1 word, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is an iterable object, `s` is the total number of uppercase words in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
