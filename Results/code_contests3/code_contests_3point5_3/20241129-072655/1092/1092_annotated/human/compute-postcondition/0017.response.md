According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more words in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the list.

To execute the loop one more time, the list `l` must have more than n words. So the adjusted state for the next iteration will be:
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200, l is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, i is the last word in the list, s is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the list**.
