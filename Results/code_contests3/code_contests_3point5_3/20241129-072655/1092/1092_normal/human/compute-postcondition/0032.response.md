Example Answer:
`s` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are involved, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 0, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 0, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty**
