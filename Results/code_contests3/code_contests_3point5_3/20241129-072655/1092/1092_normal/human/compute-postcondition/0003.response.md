According to the code, the loop will execute for each word in the list `l`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `l` is not an empty list. Since `n` represents the length of the text, it is not directly related to the loop execution. At the beginning of the loop, `m` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `l` is a non-empty list.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, l is a non-empty list, m is 0**
