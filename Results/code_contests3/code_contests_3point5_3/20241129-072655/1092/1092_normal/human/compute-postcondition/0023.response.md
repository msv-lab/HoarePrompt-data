According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more elements in `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first element of `i`, `i` is not empty. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `i` should be available. So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 1, `j` is the next element in `i`, `i` has more elements**.
