Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is 0, `s` is 3, `i` is an iterable object that `j` can iterate over. If `j` is in uppercase, the program is in this state after the execution of the if else block. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have more elements than `j` can iterate over.***
