According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` which is a non-empty list. If there is at least one more element in the list, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is the number of uppercase letters in `i`, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty. 

To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `l`. So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is the number of uppercase letters in `i`, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty**
