Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum number of uppercase characters in any word in the list `l`. The variables `n` and `l` are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum number of uppercase characters in any word in the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum number of uppercase characters in any word in the list `l`**
