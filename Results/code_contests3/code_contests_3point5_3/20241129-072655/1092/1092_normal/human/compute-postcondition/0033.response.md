According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `i`. If `i` has at least one element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `j` should be the first element of `i` since `i` is empty. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 0, `j` is the first element in `i`, `i` is a list with at least one element**
