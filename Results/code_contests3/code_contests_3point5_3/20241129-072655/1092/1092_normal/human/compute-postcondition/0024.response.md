Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The variables `n`, `l`, `m`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 2, `j` is the next element in `i`, `i` has more elements.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 2, `j` is the next element in `i`, `i` has more elements**
