Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The value of `s` represents the number of uppercase letters in `i`, and `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Since `m` is reassigned the maximum value, it will take the new maximum value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is the number of uppercase letters in `i`, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is the number of uppercase letters in `i`, `j` is the last element in `i` after the loop finishes executing, `i` is empty**
