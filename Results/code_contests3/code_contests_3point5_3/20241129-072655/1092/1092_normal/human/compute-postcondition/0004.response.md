Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `l`, and `m` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, l is a non-empty list, m is 0, s is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, l is a non-empty list, m is 0, s is 0**
