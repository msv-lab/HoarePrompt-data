According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than the length of `i`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first element in `i`, `i` is a list with at least one element. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the conditions to be met are:
- The length of `i` must be greater than `j+1`.
- If the first element `j` in `i` is an uppercase letter, then `s` must be updated to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list with at least one more element, `m` is the new maximum value between `s` and `m`, `s` is 1, `j` is the next element in `i`, `i` is a list with at least one element. If the next element `j` in `i` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is updated to 1.**
