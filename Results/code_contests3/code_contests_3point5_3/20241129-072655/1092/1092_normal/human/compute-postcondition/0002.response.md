Example Answer:
The variable m is assigned the value 0. Since the code does not interact with any other variables, the value of n representing the length of the text and the list l containing individual words remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, l is a list containing the individual words, m is 0**
