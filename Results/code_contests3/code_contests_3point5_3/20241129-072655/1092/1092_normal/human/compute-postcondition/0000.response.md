Example Answer:
The code snippet `raw_input()` is used to read input from the user, but it doesn't assign the input to any variable. Since the input is not stored in any variable, the state of the program remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text. The text consists of n single-space separated words, each word consisting of small and capital Latin letters.**
