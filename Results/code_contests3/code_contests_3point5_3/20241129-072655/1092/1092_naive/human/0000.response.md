Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes input, splits the text into words, and then iterates over each word to count the number of capital letters in each word. It keeps track of the maximum number of capital letters found in any word in the variable `m`. Finally, it prints out the maximum number of capital letters found in any word, which is the volume of the text.

The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the volume of the text by finding the maximum number of capital letters in any word. There are no edge cases identified where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
