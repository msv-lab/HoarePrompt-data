Example Answer: 
The `raw_input()` function reads a line of input from the user. The length of the text and the actual text content are not stored in any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, and the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word containing only small and capital Latin letters.**
