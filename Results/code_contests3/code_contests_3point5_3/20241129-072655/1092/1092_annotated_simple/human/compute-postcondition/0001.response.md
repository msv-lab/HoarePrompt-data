Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the value returned by `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input text into a list of words based on single spaces. Since the initial state mentions that the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, the list `l` will contain n words as elements. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, and the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word containing only small and capital Latin letters; `l` is a list containing n words.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, and the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word containing only small and capital Latin letters; `l` is a list containing n words**.
