Functionality: **The function `func` processes a text input consisting of n words separated by single spaces, where each word contains only small and capital Latin letters. It iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase characters in that word, then finds the maximum count of uppercase characters across all words. Finally, it prints out the maximum count of uppercase characters found. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly.**
