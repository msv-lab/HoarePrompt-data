Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value 0. The values of `m` and `l` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is equal to the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all elements of `l` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `l` must have more elements.
Output State: **`m` is equal to the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all elements of `l` and the previous value of `m`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `l` must have more elements.**
