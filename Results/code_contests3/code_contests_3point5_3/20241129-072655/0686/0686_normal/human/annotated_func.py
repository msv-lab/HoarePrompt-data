#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function itself does not have any specific functionality or return any output based on the provided constraints.
