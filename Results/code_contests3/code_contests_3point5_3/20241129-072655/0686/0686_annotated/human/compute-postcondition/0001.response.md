The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the positive integers n, m, a, and b where 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function does not return an error message for invalid inputs, as all inputs are within the specified constraints. The function calculates a value based on the inputs n, m, a, and b, and returns the result.
