#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on positive integers `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` within specified constraints. The function, as it stands, does not perform any calculations or operations and returns no value.
