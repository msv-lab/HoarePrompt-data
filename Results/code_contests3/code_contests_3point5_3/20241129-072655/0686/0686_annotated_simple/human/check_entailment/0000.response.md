Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it defines a function `func()` which is expected to calculate the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations as described in the problem description. Although the function is currently empty and does not perform any calculations, if implemented correctly it should be able to handle all possible cases and return the correct output.
