#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are all integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes no parameters. It performs the operation of (n//a) * (m//b) with the given constraints that n, m, a, and b are integers satisfying 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function then returns the result of this operation.
