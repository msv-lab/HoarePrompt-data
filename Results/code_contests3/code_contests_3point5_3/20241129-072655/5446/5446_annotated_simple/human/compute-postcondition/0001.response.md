Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum between `b` and `c`, divided by the minimum between `b` and `c`. Since the initial values of `b` and `c` are known to be integers, the division will result in a float value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, `x` is a float value.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input, `x` is a float value**
