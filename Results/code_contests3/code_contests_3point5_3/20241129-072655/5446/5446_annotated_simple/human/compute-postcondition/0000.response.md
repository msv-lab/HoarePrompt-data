`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input**
