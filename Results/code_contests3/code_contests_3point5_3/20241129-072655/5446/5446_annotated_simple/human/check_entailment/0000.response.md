Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The calculation of x is incorrect, as it should be the maximum number of pieces that can be put on each plate, not the ratio of the two cakes. Additionally, the calculation of the number of pieces on each plate is also incorrect.

The program should be corrected as follows:
```
from math import ceil

def func():
    n, a, b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = max(a//n, b//n)
    print(x)

func()
``` 

This corrected program calculates the maximum number of pieces that can be put on each plate and then prints that value.
