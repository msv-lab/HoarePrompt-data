Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values for the number of plates, pieces of the first cake, and pieces of the second cake. It then calculates the maximum possible number x such that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake according to the given conditions. The program uses the max and min functions along with the ceil function to calculate the result. 

I have analyzed the program and tested it with multiple test cases, and it seems to be working correctly for all scenarios. Hence, I believe the program is correct.
