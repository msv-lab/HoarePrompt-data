Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as required by the problem description. The formula used to calculate x in the program is incorrect. The program calculates x as the maximum of b and c divided by the minimum of b and c, which does not align with the problem description. The calculation of x should be based on the minimum number of pieces on a plate that can be maximized, which is not achieved in the program.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output in all cases.
