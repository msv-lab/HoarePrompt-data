Example Answer:
The code calculates the minimum value between `b` and `c`, divides it by `n`, multiplies the result by `x`, takes the ceiling of the result, and converts it to an integer before printing. The output state is based on the input values provided for `n`, `b`, `c`, and `x`.
Output State: **Based on the input values, the calculated integer value is printed.**
