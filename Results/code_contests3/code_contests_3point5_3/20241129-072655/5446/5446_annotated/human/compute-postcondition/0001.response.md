Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c` as a float. The previous values of `b` and `c` are known as integers. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, the value of `x` will be a float. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float**
