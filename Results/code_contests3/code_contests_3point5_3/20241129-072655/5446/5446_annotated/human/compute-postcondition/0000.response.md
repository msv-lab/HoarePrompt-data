Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned by converting the input values into integers using `int(x)` for each value. The `raw_input().split()` function splits the input into separate values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input**
