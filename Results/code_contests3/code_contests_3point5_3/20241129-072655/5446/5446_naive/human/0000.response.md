Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as described in the problem. The program has logical errors and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

For example:
Input:
5 2 3

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output by the program:
0

This example shows that the program does not work as expected and therefore, the correctness is false.
