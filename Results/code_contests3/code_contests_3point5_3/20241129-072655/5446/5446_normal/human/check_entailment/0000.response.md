Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code is incorrectly reading the input values as `b` and `c` instead of `a` and `b`.
2. The calculation of variable `x` is incorrect as it is calculating the ratio of the maximum number of pieces to the minimum number of pieces, instead of finding the maximum possible number of pieces that can be distributed to each plate.
3. The calculation of the final result using `ceil` and `min` is not aligned with the problem description requirements.

Therefore, the code does not correctly determine the maximum possible number `x` as required by Ivan's conditions.
