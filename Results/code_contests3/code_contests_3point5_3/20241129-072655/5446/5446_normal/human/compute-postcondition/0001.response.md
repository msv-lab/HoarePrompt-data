Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c` as a float. Since `b` and `c` are input integers, the output state is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `x` is the result of the division operation.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `x` is the result of the division operation**
