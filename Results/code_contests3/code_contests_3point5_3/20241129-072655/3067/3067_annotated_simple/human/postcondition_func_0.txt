The function `func` reads an input consisting of integers `N` and `Q`, followed by a string `S`. It then processes the string `S` to count the occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions and stores the count in a list `P`. After that, it reads pairs of integers `l` and `r` from the input and prints the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` for each pair. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the output based on the processed input.
