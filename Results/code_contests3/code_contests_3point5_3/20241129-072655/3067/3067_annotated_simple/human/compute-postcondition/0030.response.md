Example Answer:
The difference between the value of `P` at index `r - 1` and the value of `P` at index `l - 1` is printed. The variables `P`, `Q`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have executed, `P` contains the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string `S`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input.**
