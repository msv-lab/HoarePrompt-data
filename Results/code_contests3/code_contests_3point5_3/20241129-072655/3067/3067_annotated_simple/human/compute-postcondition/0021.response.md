Example Answer:
P[0] is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1], i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, P[0] is 0.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1], i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, P[0] is 0**
