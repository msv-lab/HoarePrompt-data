Example Answer:
The values of `l` and `r` are updated by mapping integer inputs from the user's input split by space. The loop will execute one more time if `Q` is still greater than 0. After this operation, the previous values of `P`, `Q`, `l`, and `r` are retained.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have executed, `P` contains the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string `S`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input, for the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must still be greater than 0**
