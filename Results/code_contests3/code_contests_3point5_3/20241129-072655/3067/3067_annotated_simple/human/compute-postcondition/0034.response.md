According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Q`. If `Q` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must still be greater than 0.
State: **After printing the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, the variables `P`, `Q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged with the condition that `Q` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
