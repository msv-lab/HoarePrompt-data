Example Answer:
The input string `S` contains a substring 'AC' in consecutive positions, and `P` counts the number of occurrences. The loop will execute as long as `Q` is greater than 0. The values of `l` and `r` are assigned by mapping the integers from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `P` contains the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string `S`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have executed, `P` contains the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string `S`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input.**
