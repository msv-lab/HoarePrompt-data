Example Answer:
The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, the value of `P[2]` will be `P[1] + 1`. Since `P[1]` is calculated based on `P[0]`, and `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` will be 1. Therefore, `P[2]` will be `1 + 1 = 2`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1, P[2] is 2, i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1, P[2] is 2, i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
