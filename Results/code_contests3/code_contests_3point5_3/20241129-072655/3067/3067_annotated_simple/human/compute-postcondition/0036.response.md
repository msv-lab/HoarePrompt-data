Example Answer: 
The code prints the difference between the value of `P` at index `r - 1` and the value of `P` at index `l - 1`. The values of `P`, `Q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. As long as `Q` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time. 
Output State: **`P`, `Q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed**
