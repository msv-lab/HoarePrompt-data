Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P is a list with N + 1 elements initialized to 0, i is 1 for the loop to execute a second time. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1. If not, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] in the loop execution.***
