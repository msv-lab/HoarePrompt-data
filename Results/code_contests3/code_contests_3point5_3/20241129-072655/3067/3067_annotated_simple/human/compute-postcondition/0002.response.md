Example Answer:
A list `P` is created with `N + 1` elements, each initialized to 0. The values of `N`, `Q`, and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are input integers, `S` is assigned the input string, `P` is a list with `N + 1` elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are input integers, `S` is assigned the input string, `P` is a list with `N + 1` elements initialized to 0**
