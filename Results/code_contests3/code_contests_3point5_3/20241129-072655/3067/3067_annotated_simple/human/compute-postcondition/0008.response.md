Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P is a list with N + 1 elements initialized to 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If i equals 0, P[0] is 0 and all other elements of P remain unchanged. When the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is true, i is such that S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC'.***
