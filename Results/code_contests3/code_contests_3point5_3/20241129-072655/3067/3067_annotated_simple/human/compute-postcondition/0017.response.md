Example Answer: 
The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`, where `i` is currently 1. Since `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` will be 0 + 1, which is 1. Therefore, after execution, the value of `P[1]` will be 1. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is an input integer, S is assigned the input string, P is a list with N + 1 elements initialized to 0, i is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1.**
