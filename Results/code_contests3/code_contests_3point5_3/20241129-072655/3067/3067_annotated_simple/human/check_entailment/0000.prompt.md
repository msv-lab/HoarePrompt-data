You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`. Answer the following Q queries:

* Query i (1 \leq i \leq Q): You will be given integers l_i and r_i (1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N). Consider the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i (both inclusive). In this string, how many times does `AC` occurs as a substring?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
* S is a string of length N.
* Each character in S is `A`, `C`, `G` or `T`.
* 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N Q
S
l_1 r_1
:
l_Q r_Q


Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Example

Input

8 3
ACACTACG
3 7
2 3
1 8


Output

2
0
3
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N, Q = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    P = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        if i == 0:
            P[0] = 0
            continue
        
        if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':
            P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            P[i] = P[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have executed, P will contain the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string S.
    for _ in range(Q):
        l, r = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop have executed, `P` contains the number of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the input string `S`, `Q` is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
