Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values for `N`, `Q`, `S`, `l_i`, and `r_i`. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in consecutive positions in the input string `S` and stores them in the list `P`. Finally, it correctly calculates and prints the number of occurrences for each query `l_i` and `r_i` based on the precomputed values in `P`.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the specified substrings of `S` for all possible queries.
