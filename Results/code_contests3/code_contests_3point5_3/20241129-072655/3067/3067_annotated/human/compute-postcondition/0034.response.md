Since there is no change in the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `Q`. After each iteration, `Q` will be decremented by 1 to continue executing the loop until `Q` becomes 0.
State: **`Q` is decremented by 1**
