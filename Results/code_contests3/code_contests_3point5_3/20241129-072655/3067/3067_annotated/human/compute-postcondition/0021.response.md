Example Answer:
`P[0]` is assigned the value 0. The list `P` already has elements [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], so after execution, the list `P` becomes [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. The values of `S`, `N`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
