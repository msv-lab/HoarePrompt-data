Example Answer: 
`P[0]` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0, N is greater than 0, and the loop has executed at least once, `i` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0, N is greater than 0, and the loop has executed at least once, `i` is equal to 0**
