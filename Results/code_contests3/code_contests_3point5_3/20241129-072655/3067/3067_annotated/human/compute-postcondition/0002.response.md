Example Answer:
`P` is assigned a list containing N+1 elements, all initialized to 0. The value of N is not provided in the initial state, so the exact size of the list cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is assigned the value of the user input provided through `raw_input()`, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the value of the user input provided through `raw_input()`, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0**
