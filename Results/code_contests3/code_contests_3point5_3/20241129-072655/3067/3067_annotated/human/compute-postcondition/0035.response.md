Example Answer:
The value of `Q` is decremented by 1. The values of `l` and `r` are assigned by mapping integers from the input separated by spaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Q` is decremented by 1, `l` and `r` are assigned integers from the input.
Output State: **`Q` is decremented by 1, `l` and `r` are assigned integers from the input**
