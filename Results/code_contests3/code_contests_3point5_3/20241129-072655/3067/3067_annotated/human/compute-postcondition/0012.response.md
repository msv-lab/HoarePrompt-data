Postcondition: ***`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0, N is greater than 0, and the loop has executed at least once. `i` is equal to 0 after the execution of the if else block. If the substring of `S` from index i-1 to i+1 is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, if the substring in S from index i-1 to i+1 is not 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.***
