Postcondition: ***`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 0] if the substring of `S` from index i-1 to i+1 is equal to 'AC'. If the substring is not 'AC', then `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]. `N` is greater than 0, and `i` remains 2.***
