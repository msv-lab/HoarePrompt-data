Postcondition: ***`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If substring of `S` from index 0 to 2 is equal to 'AC', then `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0] + 1` and `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Otherwise, if the substring in `S` from index 0 to 2 is not 'AC', then `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]` and `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.***
