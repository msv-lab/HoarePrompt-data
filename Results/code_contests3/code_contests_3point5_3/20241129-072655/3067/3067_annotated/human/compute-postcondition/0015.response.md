Output State: **`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If substring of `S` from index 0 to 2 is equal to 'AC', then `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0] + 1`. Otherwise, if the substring in `S` from index 0 to 2 is not 'AC', then `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]`. `P[0]` is initialized to 0.**
