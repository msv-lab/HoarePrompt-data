Postcondition: ***`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, the program will continue with the next iteration or the next statement in a loop. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
