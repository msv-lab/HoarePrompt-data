Example Answer:
The value of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is calculated and printed. `P` is a list of size N+1 where each element is the number of consecutive occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to that index. Therefore, the value of `P[r - 1]` represents the number of consecutive occurrences of 'AC' in `S` up to index `r - 1`, and `P[l - 1]` represents the number of consecutive occurrences up to index `l - 1`. By subtracting these values, we get the number of consecutive occurrences of 'AC' between index `l` and index `r - 1`. The values of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **No change in the initial state**
