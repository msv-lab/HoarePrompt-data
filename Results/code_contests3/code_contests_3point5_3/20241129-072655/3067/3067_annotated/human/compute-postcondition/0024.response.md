Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is initially 2, this means `P[2]` will be updated based on the value of `P[1]`. The initial state of `P` is [0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0], so after executing the code, the new value of `P` will be [0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 0]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the value of the user input, `P` is a list of size N+1 with elements [0, 1, 2, 0, ..., 0], `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
