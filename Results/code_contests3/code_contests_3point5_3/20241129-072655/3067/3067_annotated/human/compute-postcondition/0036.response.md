Example Answer: 
The value of `P` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact result of `print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])`. However, we know that `l` and `r` are assigned integers from the input, and `Q` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `Q` is decremented by 1, `l` and `r` are assigned integers from the input.
Output State: **`Q` is decremented by 1, `l` and `r` are assigned integers from the input**
