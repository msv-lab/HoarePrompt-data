Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values N, Q, and string S. It then calculates the number of consecutive occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to each index and stores this information in the list P. After that, it processes Q queries where each query consists of integers l and r. For each query, it prints the count of 'AC' occurrences between positions l and r in the string S. The function does not accept any parameters but operates on the preconditions provided.**
