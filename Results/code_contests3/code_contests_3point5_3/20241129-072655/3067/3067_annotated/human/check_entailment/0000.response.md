Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values N, Q, and string S. It then calculates the number of consecutive occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to each index and stores this information in the list P. 

For each query, it correctly processes the integers l and r and prints the count of 'AC' occurrences between positions l and r in the string S. The program satisfies all the constraints given in the problem description and produces the correct output for the example input provided. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
