Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully meet the problem description. The main issue is that the code calculates the number of 'AC' substrings up to each index `i` in the string, but it does not consider the substrings between the given `l` and `r` indices for each query. It calculates the count of 'AC' substrings up to that index, but the queries require counting the occurrences of 'AC' substrings within the specified substring. This means the code does not handle the queries as required by the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect for not considering the 'AC' substrings within the specified substring in each query.
