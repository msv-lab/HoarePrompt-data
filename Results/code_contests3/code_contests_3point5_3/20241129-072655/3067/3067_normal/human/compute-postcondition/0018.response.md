Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an integer based on user input, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list where all elements are 0 except `P[0]` which is 0, `i` is 1. If `i` equals 0, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. After the execution of the code `P[i] = P[i - 1]`, the value at index `i` in list `P` is assigned the value of the element at index `i - 1` in list `P`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.**
