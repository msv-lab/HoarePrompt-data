Example Answer:
The list `P` is initialized with a length of `N + 1` filled with zeros. The values of `N` and `Q` are based on user input, and `S` is a string input. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned integer values based on user input, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned integer values based on user input, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`**
