Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts a string input. The variables `N` and `Q` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned integer values based on user input, `S` is a string input.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned integer values based on user input, `S` is a string input**
