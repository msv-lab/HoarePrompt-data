Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list where each element `P[i]` is the count of consecutive 'AC' substrings in `S` up to index `i`, `i` is `N-1, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The output is the difference between the count of consecutive 'AC' substrings in `S` up to index `r-1` and `l-1` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
