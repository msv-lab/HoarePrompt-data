Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an integer based on user input, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list where all elements are 0 except `P[0]` which is 0, `i` is 1. If `i` equals 0, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. After the execution of the if-else block, the value at index `i` in list `P` is updated based on the condition. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in list `P` is updated based on the previous element in the list.***
