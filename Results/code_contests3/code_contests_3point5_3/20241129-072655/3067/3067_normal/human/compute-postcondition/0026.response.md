Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string, `P` is a list with specific conditions, `i` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P` is a list with the first element being 0, otherwise no change occurs. For the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `N`. After executing the code snippet, `P[i]` will be assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1` if `S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', otherwise `P[i]` remains the same as `P[i - 1]`.***
