Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integer inputs `N` and `Q`, and a string input `S`. It then calculates the count of consecutive 'AC' substrings in `S` up to each index `i` and stores these counts in a list `P`. After that, for each pair of integers `l` and `r` provided as input, it prints the difference between the count of consecutive 'AC' substrings up to index `r-1` and `l-1`. The function does not have a specific return value.**
