Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an integer based on user input, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list where all elements are 0 except `P[0]` which is 0, `i` is 0. If the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to index `i + 1` is 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. If the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to index `i + 1` is not 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.***
