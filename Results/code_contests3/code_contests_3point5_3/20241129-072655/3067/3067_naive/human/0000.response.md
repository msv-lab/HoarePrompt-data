Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem description. It initializes an array P to store the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to each index in the string S. Then, for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring by taking the difference between the values in the P array at the ending index and starting index of the substring. This logic is consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles all potential cases of queries within the constraints provided.
