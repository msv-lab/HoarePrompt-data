Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for N, Q, S, and the queries. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the given range [l, r] by maintaining a prefix sum array P. The implementation seems to handle all possible cases as per the problem description. Additionally, the program logic is straightforward and does not have any obvious flaws.
