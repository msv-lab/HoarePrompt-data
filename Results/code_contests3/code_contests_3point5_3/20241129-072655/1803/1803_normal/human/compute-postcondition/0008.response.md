Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 3`. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so the new value of `k` will depend on its initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is increased by 3**
