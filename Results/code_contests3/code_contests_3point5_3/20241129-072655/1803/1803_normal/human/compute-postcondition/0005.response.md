Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `k + 3`, where `k` is initially 1. After the execution, `k` becomes 4. The value of `Arreglo` will now be the element at index 4 of `Cadena`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
