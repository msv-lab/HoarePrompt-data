Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `k` is unknown. For the loop to execute again, the length of `Cadena` should be greater than the updated value of `k`, and `Cadena` should have more than 2 elements. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena` and the element at index `k`, where `k` has been increased by 3.
Output State: **`Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena` and the element at index `k`, where `k` has been increased by 3**
