Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo` concatenated with the element at index 4 of `Cadena`. The previous value of `Arreglo` is unknown, but the current value of `Cadena` is known as the input string. Since the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Cadena` is the input string containing small English letters separated by commas, `Arreglo` is the concatenated array including the element at index 4 of `Cadena`**
