Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 
- The code is only considering every 4th element in the input string, which is not correct according to the problem description. 
- For example, in the input "{b, a, b, a}", the code will only consider "a" and ignore "b", leading to an incorrect output. 
- The output hints also do not agree with the code, as the code is not correctly extracting and counting the distinct letters in Anton's set.
