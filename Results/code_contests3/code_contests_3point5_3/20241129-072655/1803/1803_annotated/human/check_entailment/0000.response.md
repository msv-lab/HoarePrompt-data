Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program is supposed to count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set, but the implementation does not correctly extract the letters from the input string. The program is only extracting every third character starting from the second character, which is not the correct approach to extract the letters from the set. The program needs to split the input string based on commas and then count the distinct letters. 

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for and is incorrect.
