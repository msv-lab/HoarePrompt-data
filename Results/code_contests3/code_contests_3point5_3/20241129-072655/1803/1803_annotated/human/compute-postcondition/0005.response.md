Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 3`, where `k` is 1. After execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4**
