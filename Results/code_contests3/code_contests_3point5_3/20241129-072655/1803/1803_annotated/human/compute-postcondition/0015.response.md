Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string from the user. It then iterates over the string, extracting characters at specific indices according to the loop condition. The function constructs a list `Arreglo` containing these extracted characters. Finally, it prints the count of unique elements in the list `Arreglo`. The function does not take any parameters and the input string must contain small English letters separated by commas within brackets. However, the function does not return any value, and it does not have explicit constraints or relationships between input parameters.**
