According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `Cadena` and the value of `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `Arreglo` is an empty list and `k` is 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1 and `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to 2.
State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `len(Cadena)` is greater than 1 and `k` is less than or equal to 2**
