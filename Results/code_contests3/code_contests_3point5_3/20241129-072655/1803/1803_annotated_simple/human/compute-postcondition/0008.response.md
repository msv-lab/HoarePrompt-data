Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3, and the initial value of `k` is 4. After execution, `k` becomes 7. The elements of the list `Arreglo` are still based on the element at index `k` of `Cadena`, which is now at index 7. The length of `Cadena` is greater than 2, so the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 7 of `Cadena`, `k` is 7, `[Cadena[k]]`, `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the element at index 7 of `Cadena`, `k` is 7, `[Cadena[k]]`, `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`**
