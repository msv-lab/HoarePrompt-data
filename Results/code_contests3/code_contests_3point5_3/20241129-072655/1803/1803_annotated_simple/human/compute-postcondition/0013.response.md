Example Answer:
The code prints the length of a list containing unique elements from `Arreglo`. The elements in `Arreglo` are determined by indexes in `Cadena` and are at positions 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., so the length of `Arreglo` will be the number of unique elements at those positions. The initial value of `k` is 13, and for the loop to execute, `k` should be less than the new length of `Cadena`. Since no changes are made to `Cadena` or `k`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the elements at indexes 1, 4, 7, 10, ... of `Cadena`, `k` is 13, for the loop to execute `k` should be less than the new length of `Cadena`. The code prints the length of the list of unique elements from `Arreglo`.**
