Example Answer:
The value at index 7 of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo` list. `k` is initially 7, so the value at index 7 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. After the execution, the new length of `Cadena` is checked to determine if the loop should execute again with an updated `k` value. 
Output State: **`Arreglo` now contains the element at index 7 of `Cadena` added to it, `k` is 7, `[Cadena[k]]`, and for the loop to execute again `k` should be less than the new length of `Cadena`**
