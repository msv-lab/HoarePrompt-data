Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The program incorrectly assumes that every letter in the input string is at a position that is a multiple of 3 (e.g., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...). This assumption is not valid as there can be any number of letters in the input string. 

The program should be modified to properly parse the input string and count the distinct letters in Anton's set.
