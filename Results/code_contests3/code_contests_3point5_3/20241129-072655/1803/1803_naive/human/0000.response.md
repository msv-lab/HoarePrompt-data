Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It incorrectly extracts the letters from the input string and adds them to the list `Arreglo`. The logic used to extract the letters is flawed and can lead to incorrect results. An example where the program fails is when the input is "{a, b, a}".

Corrected program:
```python
Cadena = input()
Arreglo = []
for char in Cadena:
    if char.isalpha():
        Arreglo.append(char)
print(len(set(Arreglo)))
```

Explanation: The corrected program reads each character from the input string and only adds alphabetic characters to the list `Arreglo`. It then converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and finally prints the count of distinct letters. This logic ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
