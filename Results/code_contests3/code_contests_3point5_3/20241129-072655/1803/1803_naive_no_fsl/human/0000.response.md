Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers every third character in the input string as a distinct letter, which is not the correct approach. For example, for the input "{b, a, b, a}", the program would incorrectly output 1 instead of the expected 2.
