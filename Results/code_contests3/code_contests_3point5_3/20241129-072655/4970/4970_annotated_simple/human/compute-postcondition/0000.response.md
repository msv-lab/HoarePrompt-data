Example Answer:
The code prints the value from the list based on the input provided by the user. Since the input is obtained using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer, the value of `a` determines the index of the list element to be printed. As `a` ranges from 0 to 15, the output will be the corresponding element from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. 
Output State: **The value at the index determined by `a` in the list is printed.**
