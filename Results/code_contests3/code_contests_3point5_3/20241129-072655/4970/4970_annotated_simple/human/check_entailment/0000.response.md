Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input and then uses that input as an index to access a specific element from a hardcoded list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input is constrained to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive), this program will always output the correct integer based on the input index. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs.
