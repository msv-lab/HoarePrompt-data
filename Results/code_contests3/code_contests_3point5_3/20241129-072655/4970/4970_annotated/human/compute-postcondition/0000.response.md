Example Answer:
The code snippet accesses a specific index from a list based on the user input. Since the input function is deprecated in Python 3, assuming the code is run in Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`. The list contains elements in a specific order where the index of the elements matches the input value. If `a` is 0, it will return 15, if `a` is 1, it will return 14, and so on. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= a <= 15 and the corresponding value from the list is printed based on the input.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= a <= 15 and the corresponding value from the list is printed based on the input**
