Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The given Python program takes an integer input and directly uses it as an index to access an element from a hardcoded list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input value is between 0 and 15 (inclusive) and the index to access the list is the input value itself, the program will always return the correct output. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
