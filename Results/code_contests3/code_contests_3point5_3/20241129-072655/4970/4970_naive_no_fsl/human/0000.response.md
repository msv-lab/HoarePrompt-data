Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and then uses that input as an index to access a specific element from a list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input is limited to the range of 0 to 15, and the list contains exactly 16 elements, the program covers all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct and will output the correct integer based on the input provided.
