Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly maps the input integer to the corresponding element in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The given problem description asks to output a single integer based on the input integer value, and the code achieves this by directly accessing the element in the list at the index of the input integer. Since the code handles all input integers from 0 to 15 inclusively and provides the correct output for each, it meets the requirements of the problem description. 

The output hints mention that the code does not handle cases where the input is outside the range of 0 to 15. However, this is not a requirement based on the problem description, as the input range specified is 0 to 15. Therefore, the output hints do not raise any issues with the code in this case.
