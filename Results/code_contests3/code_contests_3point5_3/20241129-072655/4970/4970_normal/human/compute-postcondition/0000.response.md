Example Answer:
The code snippet accesses a specific index in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] based on the input value received from `raw_input()`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 15, the code will output the value at the specified index. 
Output State: **The value at the index specified by the input is printed.**
