Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not fully adhere to the problem description. The code checks if there exists at least one pair of characters where the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the last occurrence of this pair in the string `c`. However, the code does not consider the possibility of reversing a substring to make the string lexicographically less. It only checks for one specific condition which is not sufficient to cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not handle all scenarios mentioned in the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
