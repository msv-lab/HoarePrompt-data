Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is initialized with the boolean value `False`. There are no changes to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the initial iterator, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the initial iterator, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is False**
