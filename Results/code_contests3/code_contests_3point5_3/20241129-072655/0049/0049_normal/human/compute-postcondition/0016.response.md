Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n - 1. If `c[i]` > `c[i + 1]`, then the program updates `flag` to False.***
