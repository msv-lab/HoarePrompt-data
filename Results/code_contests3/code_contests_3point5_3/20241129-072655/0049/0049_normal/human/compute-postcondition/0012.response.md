Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n - 1. If the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is satisfied, then the string `c` is in a state where the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, indicating a potential need for further processing.***
