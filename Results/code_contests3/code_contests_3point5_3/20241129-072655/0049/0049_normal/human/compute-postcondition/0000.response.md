Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes an input and splits it based on whitespace, then `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer. Since `map` returns an iterator, `n` will be an iterator of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an iterator of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an iterator of integers**
