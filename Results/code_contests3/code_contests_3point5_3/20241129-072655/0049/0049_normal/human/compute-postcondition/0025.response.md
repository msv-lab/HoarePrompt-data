Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the input string `c` to check if there exists at least one pair of characters where the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the last occurrence of this pair in the string `c`. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
