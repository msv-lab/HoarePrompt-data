Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `n` is the first integer from the initial iterator and the code snippet does not modify `n`, the value of `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the initial iterator, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the initial iterator, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`**
