Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True if there exists at least one pair of characters such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of such a pair in the string `c`. If no such pair exists, `flag` remains False. When `flag` is True, print(pos + 1, pos + 2)**
