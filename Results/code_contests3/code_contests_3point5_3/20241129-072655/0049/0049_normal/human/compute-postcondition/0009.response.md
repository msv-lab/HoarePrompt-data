According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should still be at least 2.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is the input string from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
