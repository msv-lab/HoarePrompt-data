The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c` as inputs. It then iterates through the elements of `c` to check if there exists a pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of those elements. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and always outputs either 'YES' with indices or 'NO' based on the conditions met in the loop.
