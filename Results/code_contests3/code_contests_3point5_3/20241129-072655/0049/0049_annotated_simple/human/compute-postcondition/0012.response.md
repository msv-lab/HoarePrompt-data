Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `c` has elements such that the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If the element at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the program updates the value of `pos` to `i`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
