Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input. If `flag` is True, then the function prints 'YES' and outputs the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, then the function does not print anything and `pos` is either the index of the last occurrence where the condition is met or None.***
