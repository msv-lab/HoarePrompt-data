Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which is used to read a string from the input. The value of `n` is an integer, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `c` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `c` is a string input**
