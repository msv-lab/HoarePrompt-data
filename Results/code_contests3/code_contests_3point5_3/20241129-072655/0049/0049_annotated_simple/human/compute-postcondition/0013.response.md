According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `c` has elements such that the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `i` is 2, `c` has elements such that the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`**
