Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the map object resulting from applying the `int` function to each element after splitting the input. The initial state does not provide the values of the elements being mapped, so the output state is: `n` is a map object containing integers after splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is a map object containing integers after splitting the input**
