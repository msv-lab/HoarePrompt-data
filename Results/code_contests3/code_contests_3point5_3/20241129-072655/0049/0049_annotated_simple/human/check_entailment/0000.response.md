Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if there exists a pair of elements in the string `c` such that the element at the previous index is greater than the element at the current index. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and outputs the indices of those elements. If no such pair exists, it prints "NO" as required in the problem description.

The program iterates through the string and correctly identifies the last occurrence where the condition is met. It then outputs the indices of the elements to be reversed in order to obtain a lexicographically less string.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
