Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if there exists a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. It iterates through the string and finds the first occurrence where the current character is greater than the next character. If such an occurrence is found, it prints "YES" and the indices of the substring to be reversed. Otherwise, it prints "NO". 
For all potential cases and inputs, the program behaves as expected and follows the problem description.
