Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aabcfg
```
The program will output "NO" because it only checks if the current character is greater than the next character. However, in this case, reversing the substring "ab" will result in "aacbfg" which is lexicographically less. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is incorrect.
