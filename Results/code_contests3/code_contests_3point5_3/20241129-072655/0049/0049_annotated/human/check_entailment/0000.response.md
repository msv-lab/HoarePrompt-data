Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates through the elements of `c` and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the last occurrence where this condition is met in `pos`. After the loop, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, it prints 'NO'.

The program output "YES" and the indices of the substring to reverse if it is possible to make the string lexicographically less by reversing a substring, and it outputs "NO" if it is impossible to do so. The program correctly handles the conditions described in the problem statement for all potential cases.
