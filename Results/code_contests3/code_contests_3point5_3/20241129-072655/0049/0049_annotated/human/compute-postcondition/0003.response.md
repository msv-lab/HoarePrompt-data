Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the boolean value False. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value based on user input, `c` is assigned the input value, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on user input, `c` is assigned the input value, `flag` is False**
