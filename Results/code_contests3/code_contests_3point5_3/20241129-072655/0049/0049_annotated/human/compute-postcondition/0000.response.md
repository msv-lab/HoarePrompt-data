Example Answer:
The code `n = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a map object. However, the initial state does not specify the values being entered by the user, so the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a map object with integer values based on user input**.
Output State: **n is a map object with integer values based on user input**
