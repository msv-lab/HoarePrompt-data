According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, as `range(n - 1)` will exclude `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is at least 2, `c` is assigned the value of `n`, and `flag` remains False.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned the value of `n`, `flag` is False**
