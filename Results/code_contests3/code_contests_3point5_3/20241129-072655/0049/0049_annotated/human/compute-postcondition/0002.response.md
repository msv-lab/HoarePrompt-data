Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, but `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3. In Python 3, the equivalent function is `input()`. Since `c` is being assigned the value directly from `raw_input()`, the value of `c` cannot be determined without knowing the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value based on user input, `c` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on user input, `c` is assigned the input value**
