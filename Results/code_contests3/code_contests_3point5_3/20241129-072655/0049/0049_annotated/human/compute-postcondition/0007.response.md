Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The variables `n`, `c`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned the value of `n`, `flag` is True, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned the value of `n`, `flag` is True, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`**
