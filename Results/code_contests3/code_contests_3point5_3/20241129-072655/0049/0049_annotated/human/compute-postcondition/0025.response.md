Functionality: **The function `func()` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates through the elements of `c` and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the last occurrence where this condition is met in `pos`. After the loop, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, it prints 'NO'. The function does not have any specified parameters and does not return any value. There might be an issue with the loop logic as it only considers elements up to `n - 2`.**
