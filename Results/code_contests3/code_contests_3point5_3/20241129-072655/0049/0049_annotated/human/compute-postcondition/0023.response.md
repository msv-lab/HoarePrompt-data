Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is assigned the value of `n`. If `flag` is True, `pos` is assigned the index of the last occurrence where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, and `print(pos + 1, pos + 2)` has been executed. If `flag` is False, `pos` is not assigned a value, and the program prints 'NO'.***
