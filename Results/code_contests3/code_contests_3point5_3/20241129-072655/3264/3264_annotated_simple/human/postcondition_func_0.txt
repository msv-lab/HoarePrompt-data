The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, it prints the results of the expressions ((n^2 - 1) / 2) and ((n^2 + 1) / 2). If `n` is not an odd integer, it prints the results of the expressions (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1).
