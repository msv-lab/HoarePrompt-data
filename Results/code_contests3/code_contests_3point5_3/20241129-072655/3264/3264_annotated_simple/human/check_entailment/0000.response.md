Correctness: **False**

The program does not always produce the correct Pythagorean triple as requested in the problem description. 

1. When n is an odd number greater than 2, the program calculates the Pythagorean triple as (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2. This is incorrect as the program should output two integers m and k such that n, m, and k form a Pythagorean triple, not directly calculate the triple based on the given input n.

2. When n is an even number, the program calculates the Pythagorean triple as n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. This is also incorrect as it does not follow the requirements of the problem description to output m and k that form a Pythagorean triple with the given input n.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not output the correct Pythagorean triple for all cases.
