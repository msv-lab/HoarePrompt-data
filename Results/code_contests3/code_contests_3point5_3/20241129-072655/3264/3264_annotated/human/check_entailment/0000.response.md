Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads an integer `n` from input and then checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2, it then checks if `n` is odd or even. Depending on whether `n` is odd or even, it calculates and prints the corresponding Pythagorean triple values as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program outputs the correct Pythagorean triple values for the given input `n`, following the problem description.
