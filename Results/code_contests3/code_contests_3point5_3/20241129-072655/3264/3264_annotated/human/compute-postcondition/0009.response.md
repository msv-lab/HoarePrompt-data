Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer. If n <= 2, then n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2. If n is odd and greater than 2, the function is executed with n being a positive odd integer greater than 2. If n is even and greater than 2, the function is executed with n being a positive integer greater than 2, and the number n is even.***
