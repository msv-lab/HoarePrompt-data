Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two expressions: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. Since n is a positive even integer greater than 2, the result of the first expression will always be an integer, which is (n * n / 4 - 1). The second expression will also result in an integer, which is (n * n / 4 + 1). Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than 2. The number n is even.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2. The number n is even**
