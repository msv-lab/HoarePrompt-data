The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it calculates and prints two values: (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it calculates and prints two values: n^2 / 4 - 1 and n^2 / 4 + 1. The function does not return any value.
