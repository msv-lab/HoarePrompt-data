Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The code seems to be trying to calculate Pythagorean triples based on the input value of `n`, but the calculations are incorrect.

For example, if `n = 3`, the code should output `4 5` as a Pythagorean triple, but the code will output `4 5` instead. This indicates that the code is not handling the case of odd values of `n` correctly.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
