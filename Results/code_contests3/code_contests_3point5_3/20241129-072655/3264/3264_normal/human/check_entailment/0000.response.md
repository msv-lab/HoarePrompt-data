Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the code should output two integers m and k to form a Pythagorean triple, but the code does not actually print the values correctly. 

For example, if n = 3, the expected output should be 4 5, but the code incorrectly calculates and prints ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2) instead of 4 and 5.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not output the correct Pythagorean triple for the given input.
