Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and performs calculations based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2, it calculates and prints ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is a positive even integer larger than 2, it calculates and prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not return any value.**
