Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two expressions: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. Since n is a positive integer larger than 2 and n is an even number, the result of the first expression is (n^2 / 4) - 1 and the result of the second expression is (n^2 / 4) + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer larger than 2 and n is an even number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer larger than 2 and n is an even number**
