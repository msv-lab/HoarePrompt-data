Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the integer square root `x` of the input `n` and then based on specific conditions, determines the value of `answr` which represents the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose exactly `n` city blocks. The logic in the program ensures that the minimum perimeter is calculated correctly for different cases of `n`. The program handles the scenarios where `x^2 = n`, `x * (x + 1) > n`, and the general case where the minimum perimeter is 4 times the next integer after `x`. 

Therefore, the program always produces the correct output as per the problem description for all possible cases within the specified constraints.
