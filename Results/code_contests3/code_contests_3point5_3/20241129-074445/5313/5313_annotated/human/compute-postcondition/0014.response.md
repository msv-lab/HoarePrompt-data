Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and determines the value of `answr` based on specific conditions. If `x` squared equals `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times `x`. If `x` multiplied by `x + 1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is set to 2 times `x + 1`. Otherwise, `answr` is set to 4 times the next integer after `x`. The final value of `answr` is then printed as an integer.**
