Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where x is the integer square root of n. The product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, so x and x + 1 are consecutive integers. Therefore, the value of x is such that the product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to n. The output state is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `answr` is 4 times the next integer after `x`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is 4 times the next integer after `x`**
