Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n. If x^2 = n, answr is 4 times the integer square root of n. If x * (x + 1) > n, answr is an integer greater than or equal to 6. Otherwise, answr is 4 times the next integer after x.***
