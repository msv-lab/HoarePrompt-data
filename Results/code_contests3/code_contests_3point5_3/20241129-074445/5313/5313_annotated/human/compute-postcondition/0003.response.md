Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by 4. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and the integer square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` will be equal to 4 times the integer square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is 4 times the integer square root of `n`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is 4 times the integer square root of `n`**
