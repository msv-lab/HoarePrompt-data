Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `4x + 2`. Given that the product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`, the minimum value of `x` is 1. Therefore, the minimum value of `answr` is 6. The other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is an integer greater than or equal to 6.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is an integer greater than or equal to 6**
