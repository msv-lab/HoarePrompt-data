Example Answer:
The value of `answr` depends on the value of `x`, which is the integer square root of `n`. If `x^2 = n`, then `answr` is 4 times `x`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is an integer greater than or equal to 6. Otherwise, `answr` is 4 times the next integer after `x`. The final output will be the value of `answr` printed.
Output State: **The value of `answr` is printed based on the conditions mentioned above.**
