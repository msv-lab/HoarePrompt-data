Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` can range from 1 to 10^6. Therefore, the output state is N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is an input integer**
