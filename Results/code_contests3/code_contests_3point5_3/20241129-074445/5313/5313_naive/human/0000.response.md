Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose N city blocks. It first calculates the square root of N and then checks three cases to determine the minimum perimeter - if the square of the square root is equal to N, if the product of the square root and the next number is greater than N, or if none of the above conditions are met. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for each case.
