Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1). Given that x is the square root of n and the product of x and (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, we can calculate that the value of x must be such that x(x+1) <= n. Therefore, after execution, the value of `answr` will be 4 times the value of x + 1. 
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of n, and `answr` = 4 * (x + 1)**
