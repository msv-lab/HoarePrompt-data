Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n. If x^2 = n, then answr is 4 times the square root of n. Otherwise, if x * (x + 1) > n, then answr is calculated based on x. If x * (x + 1) ≤ n, then answr = 4 * (x + 1). `answr` is converted to an integer.**
