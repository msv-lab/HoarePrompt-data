Functionality: **The function `func` takes an integer input `n` and calculates the square root `x` of `n`. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, it sets the answer `answr` to 4 times the square root of `n`. If `x` multiplied by `x + 1` is greater than `n`, it calculates `answr` based on `x`. Otherwise, if `x` multiplied by `x + 1` is less than or equal to `n`, it sets `answr` to 4 times `x + 1`. The function then prints the integer value of `answr`.**
