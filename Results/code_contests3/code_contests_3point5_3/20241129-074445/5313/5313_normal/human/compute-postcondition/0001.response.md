Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n` using the `**` operator. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `x` will be the square root of that integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n**
