Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved based on the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route. The logic implemented in the code agrees with the problem description, and the examples provided in the description all produce the correct output. The output hints also support the code by describing the steps taken to calculate the minimum perimeter accurately. Therefore, the code is correct.
