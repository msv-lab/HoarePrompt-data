Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n` which is calculated by `n ** 0.5`. The value of `n` is given as an input integer, so after execution, `x` is the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer; `x` is the square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer; `x` is the square root of `n`**
