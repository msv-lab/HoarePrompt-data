Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. Since `x` is the square root of `n` and `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` will be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer; `x` is the square root of `n`. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, `answr` is calculated based on the given formula.**
