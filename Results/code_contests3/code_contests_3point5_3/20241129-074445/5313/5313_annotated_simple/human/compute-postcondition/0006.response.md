Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `n`. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`, and the product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`. Therefore, the value of `x` is calculated based on the initial state of `n`, and then `answr` is calculated accordingly.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`, `answr` is calculated based on the conditions specified.**
