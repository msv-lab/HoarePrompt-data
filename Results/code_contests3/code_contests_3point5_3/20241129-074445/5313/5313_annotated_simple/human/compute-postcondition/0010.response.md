Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer; x is the square root of n. If x^2 = n, then answr is assigned the value of x * 4. Otherwise, if x * (x + 1) > n, answr is calculated based on certain conditions. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, answr is calculated based on a different formula.***
