Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter required to enclose N city blocks based on the problem description. It first calculates the square root of N and then checks if the square of the square root is equal to N. If it is, it calculates the perimeter as 4 times the square root. If not, it checks if the product of the square root and square root plus 1 is greater than N. Based on this condition, it calculates the perimeter accordingly. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
