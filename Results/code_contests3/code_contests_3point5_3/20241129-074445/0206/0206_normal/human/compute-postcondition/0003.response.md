Example Answer:
The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a` is calculated and stored in variable `ans`. The values of N, a_i, and a are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**
