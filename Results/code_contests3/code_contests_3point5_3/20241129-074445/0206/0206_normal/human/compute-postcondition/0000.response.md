Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The values of `N` and `a_i` are not directly affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N**
