Example Answer:
The input is split and stored in list `a`. The values of `N` and `a_i` are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values**
