Example Answer:
The function np.abs calculates the absolute value of the result of np.max(a) - np.min(a). The np.max(a) function returns the maximum value in list a, while np.min(a) returns the minimum value in list a. Since a contains split input values, the maximum and minimum values are found from those input values. The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values is then calculated and assigned to the variable ans. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values, and `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i where 1 <= i <= N, `a` is a list containing the split input values, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**.
