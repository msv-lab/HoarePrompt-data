Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is not correctly calculating the minimum distance to be traveled. The issue lies in the usage of the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions. These functions are used to find the maximum and minimum values in an array, but when applied to an array of strings (which is the case here since the input values are read as strings), they do not return the correct maximum and minimum values.

For example, in the case where the input is "4\n2 3 7 9", the code will calculate `np.abs(np.max(['2', '3', '7', '9']) - np.min(['2', '3', '7', '9']))`, which would result in an error since the max and min functions do not work as intended on an array of strings.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not provide the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description.
