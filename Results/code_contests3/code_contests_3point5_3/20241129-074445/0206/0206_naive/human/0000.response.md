Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled by AtCoDeer. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
4
2 6 4 8

The correct minimum distance to be traveled in this case would be 6 (moving from house at coordinate 2 to house at coordinate 4 and then back to house at coordinate 6). However, the program would output 6 (abs(8 - 2) = 6), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
