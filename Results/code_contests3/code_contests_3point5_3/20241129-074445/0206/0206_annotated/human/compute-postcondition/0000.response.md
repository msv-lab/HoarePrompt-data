Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. Since the input function `raw_input()` is used with Python 2, it reads a string from standard input. Therefore, `N` will be a string containing the user input. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`N` is a string containing the user input, a_i is an integer where 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i**
