Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is calculated as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The values in list `a` are between 0 and 1000. After calculating the absolute difference, the result is printed using the `print` function.
Output State: **`N` is a string containing the user input, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i, and the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a` is printed**
