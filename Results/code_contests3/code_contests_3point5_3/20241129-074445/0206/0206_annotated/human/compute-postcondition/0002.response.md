Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using NumPy functions. The result is assigned to the variable `ans`. Since `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i, the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values can be at most 1000. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a string containing the user input, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.
Output State: **`N` is a string containing the user input, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`**
