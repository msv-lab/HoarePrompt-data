Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input integers, which is not the minimum distance to be traveled by AtCoDeer. The correct approach to solving the problem would involve sorting the input values, finding the mid-point of the sorted list, and calculating the distance from the mid-point to the furthest house. 

Additionally, the program is missing necessary imports for `raw_input()` and `np`, which would cause errors when running the function. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
