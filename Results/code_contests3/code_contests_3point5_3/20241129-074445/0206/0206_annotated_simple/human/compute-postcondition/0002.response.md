Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
