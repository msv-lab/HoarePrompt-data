Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value stored in the variable `ans`. The value of `ans` and other variables are not given in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
