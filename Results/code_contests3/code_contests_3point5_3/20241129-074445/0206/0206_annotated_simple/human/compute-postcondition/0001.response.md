Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the result of splitting the input string by spaces. Each element in the resulting list will be a string. The initial state does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
