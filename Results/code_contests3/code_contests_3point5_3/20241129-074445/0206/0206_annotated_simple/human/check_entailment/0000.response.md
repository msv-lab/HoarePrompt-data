Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem described in the problem description. 
1. The program does not convert the input values to integers, which may cause issues when trying to perform mathematical operations on them.
2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. The correct function to use for user input in Python 3 is `input()`.
3. The program does not import the necessary module `numpy` to use functions like `np.abs`, `np.max`, and `np.min`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
