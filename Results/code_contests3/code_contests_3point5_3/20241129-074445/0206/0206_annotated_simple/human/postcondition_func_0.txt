The function `func` reads input from the user, where the first input `N` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in a list. The second input is a list of integers `a_i` where each integer is between 0 and 1000. The function then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`, but it does not return any value, only prints the result. However, the code is missing the necessary import statements for `numpy` and error handling for invalid inputs.
