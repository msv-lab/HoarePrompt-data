Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as described in the problem. The program calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list of house coordinates, which is not the correct approach.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The expected output should be 7, as the minimum distance to be traveled is from house 2 to house 9. However, the program will output 7, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
