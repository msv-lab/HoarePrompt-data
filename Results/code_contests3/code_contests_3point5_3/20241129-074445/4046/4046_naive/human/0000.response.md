Correctness: **False**

The given program does not produce the correct output for all potential cases. For example, if the input is 7, the expected output should be 47 but the program will output 4747. This discrepancy shows that the program does not accurately find the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
