Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is already known to be greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is less than 10, the loop has executed with the final value of `i` based on the specified range, `tem` is an integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` contains an equal count of '7's and '4's, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is the updated minimum value after comparison with `tem`.**
