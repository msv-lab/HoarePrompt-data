Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. Since the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the value of `x` must contain an equal number of '7's and '4's. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is a new value less than 10, `ans` has its current value, `i` is recalculated based on the new value of `l` to be within the range `(l, 10, 2)`, `tem` is updated based on the count of '7' and '4' in `x`.
Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is a new value less than 10, `ans` has its current value, `i` is recalculated based on the new value of `l` to be within the range `(l, 10, 2)`, `tem` is updated based on the count of '7' and '4' in `x`**
