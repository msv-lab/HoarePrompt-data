Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the existing `ans` and `tem`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` remains less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the existing `ans` and `tem`, `i` is `l + 2 + 1`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x`, and `x` contains an equal count of '7's and '4's for the loop to execute another time.
