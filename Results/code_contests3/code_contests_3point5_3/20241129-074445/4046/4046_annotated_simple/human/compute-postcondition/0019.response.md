Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is less than 10 and may have been incremented by 1, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the new value of `tem`, the loop has executed at least twice with `i+1` being the new value based on the specified range, `tem` is an integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s, where `tem` will be either 44 or 77. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` and the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then the value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between 4444477777 and `tem`**
