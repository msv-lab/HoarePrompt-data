According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `l + 2`, the loop can execute one more time. Before the loop starts, `i` is the final value after the loop has executed, so it needs to be adjusted to `l + 2` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the lowest integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s that is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop has executed with the final value of `i` based on the specified range, `tem` is an integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is `l + 2`**
