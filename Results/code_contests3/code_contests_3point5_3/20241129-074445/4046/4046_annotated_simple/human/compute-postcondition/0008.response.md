The code converts the list `x` into an integer `tem` by joining the elements of `x`. Since the number of 7s in `x` is equal to the number of 4s in `x`, the resulting integer `tem` will be a number created from a combination of 4s and 7s only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is less than 10 and may have been incremented by 1, `ans` is 4444477777, the loop has executed at least once with `i` being the initial value based on the specified range, `tem` is an integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s.**
