Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is a new value less than 10, `ans` is updated with the minimum value, `i` is recalculated based on the new value of `l` to be within the range `(l, 10, 2)`, `tem` is updated based on the count of '7' and '4' in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again.***
