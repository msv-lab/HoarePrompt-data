Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is less than 10 and may have been incremented by 1, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, the loop has executed at least once with `i+1` being the new value based on the specified range, `tem` is an integer created from a combination of 4s and 7s, where `tem` will be either 44 or 77. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between 4444477777 and `tem`.***
