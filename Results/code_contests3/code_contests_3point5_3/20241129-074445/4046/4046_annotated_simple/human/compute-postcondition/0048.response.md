Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is a new value less than 10, `ans` is updated with the minimum value, `i` is recalculated based on the new value of `l`, and `tem` is updated based on the count of '7' and '4' in `x`.
Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer with an odd number of digits, `l` is a new value less than 10, `ans` is updated with the minimum value, `i` is recalculated based on the new value of `l`, `tem` is updated based on the count of '7' and '4' in `x`.**
