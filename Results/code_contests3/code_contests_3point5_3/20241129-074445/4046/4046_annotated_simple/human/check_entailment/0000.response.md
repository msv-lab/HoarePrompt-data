Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an input positive integer `n`, calculates the number of digits in `n` and increments it if it's odd. Then, it iterates over all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of length `l` to find the least super lucky number greater than or equal to `n`. Finally, it prints the result.

The program ensures that the generated number has an equal number of '4' and '7' digits, making it a super lucky number. It also guarantees that the generated number is the least possible number that meets the conditions. Thus, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
