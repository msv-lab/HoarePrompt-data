The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the number of digits in `n`, and then finds the smallest number constructed from combinations of '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the number of digits in `n` is odd, it increments the count by 1. The function then prints the calculated minimum number. This function does not explicitly return any value.
