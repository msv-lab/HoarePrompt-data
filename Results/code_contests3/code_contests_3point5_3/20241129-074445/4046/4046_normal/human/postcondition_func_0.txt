The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and then calculates the minimum integer greater than or equal to `n` which has an equal count of '7' and '4' characters when represented as a string of even length. This is done by iterating through possible combinations of '7' and '4' characters. The calculated minimum integer is then printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on user input.
