Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9**
