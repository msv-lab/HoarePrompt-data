Since the loop is iterating over the product of '74' with a repeat value of `i`, the loop will execute again if there are more combinations of '74' to explore. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9
- `l` is an even number between 1 and 10
- `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`
- `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`
- `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`
- `x` exists for the loop to execute
- The number of '7's in `x` is equal to the number of '4's in `x`

To execute the loop one more time:
- Since `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, we need to increment `i` to the next even number after the current `i`.
- If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program retains the same state as the precondition. So, if `tem` is less than `n`, we need to adjust `tem` accordingly to meet the condition for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after the current `i`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n` and less than `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute. The number of '7's in `x` is equal to the number of '4's in `x`.**
