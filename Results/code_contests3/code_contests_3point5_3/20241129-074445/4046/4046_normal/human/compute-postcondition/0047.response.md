Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute. The number of '7's in x is equal to the number of '4's in x. `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`***
