According to the code, the loop will execute if `l` is even. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `l` needs to be an even number. Additionally, the loop will start from `l` and increment by 2 until it reaches 10. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` will be equal to `l`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `i` is equal to `l`**
