Example Answer:
If the condition is satisfied, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` where `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` that are greater than or equal to `n`. If no combination of '7' and '4' characters satisfies the conditions, the initial state is retained and nothing changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, where `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`. If no combination of '7' and '4' characters satisfies the conditions, the initial state is retained.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, where `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`. If no combination of '7' and '4' characters satisfies the conditions, the initial state is retained.**
