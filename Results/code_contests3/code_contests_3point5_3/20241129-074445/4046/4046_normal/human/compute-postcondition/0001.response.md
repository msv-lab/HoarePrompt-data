Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is assigned the value `4444477777`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the length of its string representation will be between 1 and 10. Therefore, `l` will be between 1 and 10. The value of `ans` remains constant. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is between 1 and 10, `ans` is 4444477777**
