Example Answer:
The new value of `ans` will be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The variables `n`, `l`, `i`, and `tem` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`**
