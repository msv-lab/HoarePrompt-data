According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. The variable `i` is determined by the next even number after `l + 2`. The variable `x` is generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times. The loop will execute as long as `x` exists. 

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute**
