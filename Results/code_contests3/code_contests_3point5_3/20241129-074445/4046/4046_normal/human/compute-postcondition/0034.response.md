Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is calculated and stored back in `ans`. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `tem`, and `x` are used to calculate `tem`. The specific values of `n`, `l`, and `x` are not given, so the exact value of `tem` cannot be determined. The conditions given for `x` and `tem` must be satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 3`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` is obtained by joining the characters in '74' and is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 3`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` is obtained by joining the characters in '74' and is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`**
