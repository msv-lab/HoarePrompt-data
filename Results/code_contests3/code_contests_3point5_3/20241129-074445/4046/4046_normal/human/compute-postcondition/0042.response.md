Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`. The loop iterates through all possible combinations of '7' and '4' characters of length `i`, checking if the counts are equal. If they are equal and the resulting integer value is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`. If no combination satisfies the conditions, the initial state is retained.**
