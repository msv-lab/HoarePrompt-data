Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 3`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` is obtained by joining the characters in '74' and is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program retains the initial state without any changes.***
