Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+3`, the loop executes another time if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program updates the values accordingly based on the conditions stated.***
