Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, the program will update `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
