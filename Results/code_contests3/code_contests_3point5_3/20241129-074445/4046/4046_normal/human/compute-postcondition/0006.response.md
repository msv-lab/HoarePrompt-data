According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of the product of '74' repeated `i` times is equal to `l`. Since `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, it is best to set `i` to `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is equal to `l`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is equal to `l` for the loop to execute the first time**
