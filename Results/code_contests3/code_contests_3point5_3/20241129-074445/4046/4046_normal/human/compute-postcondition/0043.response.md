At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9
- `l` is an even number between 1 and 10
- `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`
- `i` is equal to `l + 2`
- `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Update `i` to be the next even number after `l + 2`
- Calculate a new `tem` value based on the updated `i` and `x`
- Check if any combination of '7' and '4' characters of length `i` satisfies the conditions mentioned
- If a combination does meet the conditions, update `ans` to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`
- If no combination satisfies the conditions, retain the initial state

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n**`.
