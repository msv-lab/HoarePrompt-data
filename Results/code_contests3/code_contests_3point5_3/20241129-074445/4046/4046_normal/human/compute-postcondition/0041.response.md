Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l + 4. If the count of character '7' in `x` is equal to the count of character '4' in `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`.***
