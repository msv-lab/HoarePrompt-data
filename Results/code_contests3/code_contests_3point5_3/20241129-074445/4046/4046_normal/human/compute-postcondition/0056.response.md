According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If the loop is to execute again, `i` needs to be increased to the next even number after the current `i`, and `x` needs to exist. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after the current `i`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n` and less than `n`, `x` exists, and the number of '7's in `x` is equal to the number of '4's in `x`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after the current `i`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n` and less than `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute, and the number of '7's in `x` is equal to the number of '4's in `x`.**
