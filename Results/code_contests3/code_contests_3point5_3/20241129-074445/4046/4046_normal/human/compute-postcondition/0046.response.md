Example Answer:
The characters in `x` are joined together to form an integer value, which is then assigned to `tem`. The number of '7's in `x` is equal to the number of '4's in `x`, and `x` exists for the loop to execute. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute. The number of '7's in x is equal to the number of '4's in x.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `l` is an even number between 1 and 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number after `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x` which is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` exists for the loop to execute. The number of '7's in x is equal to the number of '4's in x**
