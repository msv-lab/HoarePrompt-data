Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from the user input and then calculates the minimum integer greater than or equal to `n` which has an equal count of '7' and '4' characters when represented as a string of even length.
- It iterates through possible combinations of '7' and '4' characters and finds the minimum integer that satisfies the condition.
- The code correctly handles the case where the input number is odd by incrementing the length to the next even number.
- It then finds the least super lucky number that is not less than `n` and prints the result.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
