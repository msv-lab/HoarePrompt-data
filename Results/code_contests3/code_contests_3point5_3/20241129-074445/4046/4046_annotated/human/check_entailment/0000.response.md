Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always find the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. The program iterates through all possible combinations of '74' for even values of `i`, but it does not guarantee that the first super lucky number found is the least one that is more than or equal to n. This means that the program may output a super lucky number that is greater than n but not the least one.

To correct this, the program should keep track of the minimum super lucky number found that is greater than or equal to n and update it whenever a new super lucky number that meets the conditions is found.
