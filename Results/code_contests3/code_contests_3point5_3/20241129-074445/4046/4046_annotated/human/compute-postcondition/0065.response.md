Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from the user input, calculates the number of digits in `n`, then iterates through all possible combinations of '74' for even values of `i`, finding the minimum integer value that meets certain conditions, and finally prints this minimum value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly. **
