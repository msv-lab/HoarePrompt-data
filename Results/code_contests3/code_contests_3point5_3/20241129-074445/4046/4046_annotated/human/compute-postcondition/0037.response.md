According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
