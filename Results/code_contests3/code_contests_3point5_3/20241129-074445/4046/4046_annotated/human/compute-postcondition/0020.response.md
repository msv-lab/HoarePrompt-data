Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is calculated and assigned to `ans`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ans` and `tem`, we can only conclude that `ans` will be updated with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is an even number, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `x` should still be able to be generated with a repeat of '74' for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated with the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is an even number, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `x` should still be able to be generated with a repeat of '74' for the next iteration**
