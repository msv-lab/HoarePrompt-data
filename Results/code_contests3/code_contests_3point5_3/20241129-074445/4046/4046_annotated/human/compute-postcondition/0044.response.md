For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be less than 10, `i` is an even number, `x` is a string of only '7' and '4' characters**
