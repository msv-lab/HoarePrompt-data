Example Answer:
The code converts the string `x` into an integer value and assigns it to `tem`. The value of `x` is a string of only '7' and '4' characters. Since the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the integer conversion can be performed. Therefore, `tem` now holds the integer value of the joined string `x`.
Output State: **`tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`**
