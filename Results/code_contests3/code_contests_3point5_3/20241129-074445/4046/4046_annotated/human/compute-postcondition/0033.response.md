Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value of the joined string `x`. Given the initial conditions, `tem` is already greater than or equal to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`**
