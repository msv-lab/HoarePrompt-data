According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `i` is an even number. The loop iterates over the Cartesian product of the string '74' repeated `i` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be an even number. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `i` is an even number**
