Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is an even number, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should still be able to be generated with a repeat of '74' for the next iteration.**
