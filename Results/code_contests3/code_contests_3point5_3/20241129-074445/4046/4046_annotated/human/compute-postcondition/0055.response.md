Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be less than 10 and an even number, `x` is a string of only '7' and '4' characters, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. If `x` has an equal count of '7' and '4', `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.***
