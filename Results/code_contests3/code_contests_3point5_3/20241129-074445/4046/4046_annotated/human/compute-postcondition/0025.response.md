According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute the first time**
