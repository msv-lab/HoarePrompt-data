Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, where `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. The previous values of `ans` and `tem` are unknown, so the output state is: `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`**
