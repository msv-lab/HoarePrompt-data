Example Answer: 
`tem` is assigned the integer value of the string `x` after joining all its characters. The previous values of variables do not affect the calculation of `tem`, so the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is an even number, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is an even number, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`**
