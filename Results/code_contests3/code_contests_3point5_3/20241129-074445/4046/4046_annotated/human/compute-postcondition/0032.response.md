According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `x`, `tem`, and `n`. If `tem` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `tem` being less than or equal to `n` must be satisfied. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute another time, `tem` must be less than or equal to `n`.**
