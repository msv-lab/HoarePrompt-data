Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`.
Output State: **`tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`**
