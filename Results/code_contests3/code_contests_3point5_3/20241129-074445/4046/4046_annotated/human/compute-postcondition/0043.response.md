According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 10.**
