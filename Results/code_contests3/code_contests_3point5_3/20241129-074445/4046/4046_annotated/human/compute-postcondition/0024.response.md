According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 until it reaches 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is an even number, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is an even number, the next possible value for `i` would be the current value plus 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
