Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Since no specific values are provided for `ans` and `tem`, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute the first time, The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and after entering the if condition, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute the first time, The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
