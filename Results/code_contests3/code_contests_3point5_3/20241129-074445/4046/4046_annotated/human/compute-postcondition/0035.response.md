Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`.***
