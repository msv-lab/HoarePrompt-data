Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`**
