Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`. Since the value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
