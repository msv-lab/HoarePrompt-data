Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be updated based on the user input, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9)**
