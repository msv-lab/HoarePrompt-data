Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` and is the integer value of the joined string `x`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`**.
