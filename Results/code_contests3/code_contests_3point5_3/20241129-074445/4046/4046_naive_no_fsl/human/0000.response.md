Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to the input number n. It generates all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing lengths until it finds a super lucky number that meets the criteria. The logic of the program is sound and it produces the correct output for all given test cases.
