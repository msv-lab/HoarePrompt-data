Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input integers, calculates the sum of those integers, and then checks if the sum is not zero and divisible by the count of integers. If these conditions are met, it prints the average of the integers which represents the initial bet size. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the count of integers, it prints -1 as there is no valid initial bet size that can lead to the given final coin amounts for the players. The program follows the problem description for every potential case.
