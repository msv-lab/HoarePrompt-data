Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of all the integers in the list `c`, but the specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100**
