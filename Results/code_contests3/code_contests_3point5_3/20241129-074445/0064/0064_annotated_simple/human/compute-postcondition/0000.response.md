Example Answer:
The code takes input as a string, splits it into individual parts, converts each part into an integer, and then stores them in the variable `c`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are updated based on the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `c` contains the input values as integers.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `c` contains the input values as integers.**
