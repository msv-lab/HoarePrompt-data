Example Answer:
The sum of all input values in `c` is calculated and stored in variable `s`. The initial states of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers between 0 and 100. After executing the code, the sum of these values will be stored in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `s` is the sum of `c`.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `s` is the sum of `c`**
