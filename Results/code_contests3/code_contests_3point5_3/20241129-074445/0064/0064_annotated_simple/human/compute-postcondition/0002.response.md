Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or if it is not divisible evenly by the length of the list `c`. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the values in `c`. Since `s` is the sum of `c`, it is guaranteed to be divisible by the length of `c`, so the average is `s / len(c)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `s` is the sum of `c`, and the average of `c`.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100 and `s` is the sum of `c`, and the average of `c`**
