Correctness: **True**

The program takes input as five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the sum of coins and checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is, then it prints the average number of coins each player initially had as the initial bet. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately by determining the size of the initial bet based on the input values. It correctly handles the case where there is no valid initial bet possible by returning -1.
