Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not zero and is divisible by the number of players, it calculates and prints the initial bet value. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases as mentioned in the problem statement. There are no edge cases that are not handled by the program, and it provides the correct output for all possible inputs.
