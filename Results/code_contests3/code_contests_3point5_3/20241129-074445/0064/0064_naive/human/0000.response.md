Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input as a list of integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the total sum of coins and checks if the total sum is divisible by 5 (the number of players). If the sum is not divisible by 5 or if the sum is 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid initial bet size. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the initial bet size by dividing the total sum by 5.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases. If the sum of coins is not divisible by 5 or if the sum is 0, the program correctly outputs -1. Otherwise, it correctly calculates the initial bet size and outputs it.
