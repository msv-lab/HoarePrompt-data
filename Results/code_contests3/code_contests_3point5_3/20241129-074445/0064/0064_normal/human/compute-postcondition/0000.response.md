Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the values obtained from splitting the input as integers to variable `c`. Since the initial state does not provide input values, the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100**
