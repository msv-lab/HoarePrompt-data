Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of the values in the list `c`, but the specific values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are not given. Since c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the sum of these values will be between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c**
