Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input as integers into a list `c`, calculates the sum of the integers in `c`, and then prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the length of `c`, or the average of the sum divided by the length of `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on non-negative integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 within the range 0 to 100.**
