Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if the sum of c is 0 or not divisible by the length of c. If the condition is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the division of the sum of c by the length of c. No variable values change, so the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c**
