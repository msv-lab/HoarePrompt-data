Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes input as integers into a list `c`, calculates the sum of the integers in `c`, and then prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the length of `c`, or the average of the sum divided by the length of `c`. This approach aligns with the problem description as it determines the initial bet size 'b' based on the final number of coins each player has. The code handles all cases as specified in the problem description and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality. All examples provided in the description are covered by the code and produce the correct output.
