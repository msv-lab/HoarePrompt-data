According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `output` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, and `n` is a non-zero integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero integer that is less than `j`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`output` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j`**
