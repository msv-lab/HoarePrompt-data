Example Answer:
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since the output is 2, it implies that the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is at position 2. Therefore, `j` must be 1 (binary representation of 1 is 01, rightmost set bit is at position 2) for the output to be 2.
Output State: **output is 2, `j` is 1**
