According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `output` is 0, `j` is `n-2`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, so `j` will be `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `n-1`.
State: **`output` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `n-1`**
