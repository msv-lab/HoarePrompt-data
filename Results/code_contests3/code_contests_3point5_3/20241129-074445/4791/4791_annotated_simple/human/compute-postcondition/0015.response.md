Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j+1`, then adds 1 to get the final output. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, and in binary, it is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 1 (from the right), so the output will be 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `output` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute a second time, the output of the code is 0.
Output State: **`output` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute a second time, the output of the code is 0**
