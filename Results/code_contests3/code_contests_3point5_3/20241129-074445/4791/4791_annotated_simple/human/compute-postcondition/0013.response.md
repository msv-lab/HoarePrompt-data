Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of (j + 1). Since j is 0, j + 1 is 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1', and the rightmost set bit is at position 0 (counting from the right starting at 0). Therefore, the output of the code is 1.
Output State: **`output` is 2, `j` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer for the loop to execute the first time, the output of the code is 1**
