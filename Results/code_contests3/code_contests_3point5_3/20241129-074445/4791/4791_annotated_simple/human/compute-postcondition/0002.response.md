Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `n` is unknown. Since `n` is any non-empty string value, trying to subtract 1 from a string will result in an error. Therefore, the program will encounter an error during execution.
Output State: **Error: Cannot subtract 1 from a non-integer value**
