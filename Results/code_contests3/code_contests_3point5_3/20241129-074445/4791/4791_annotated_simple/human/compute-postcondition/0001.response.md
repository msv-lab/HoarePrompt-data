According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `n` evaluates to True. As `n` can hold any string value, it will evaluate to True unless it is an empty string. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` should be any non-empty string value.
State: **`n` is any non-empty string value for the loop to execute the first time**
