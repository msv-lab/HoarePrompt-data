Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value `n-1`, so `j` is one less than `n`. The code then prints the position of the rightmost set bit (1-bit) in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is determined by `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. The output of this code will be the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` starting from the rightmost bit as 1-indexed. 
Output State: **Output will be the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` starting from the rightmost bit as 1-indexed.**
