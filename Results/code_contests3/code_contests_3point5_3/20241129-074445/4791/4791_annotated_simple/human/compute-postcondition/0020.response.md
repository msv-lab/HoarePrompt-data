Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1, so its value is `n-1`. Since `j` was initially set to `n-1`, after this operation, `j` will be updated to `n-2`. The value of `output` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `output` is 0, `j` is `n-2`, `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j`.
Output State: **`output` is 0, `j` is `n-2`, `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j`**
