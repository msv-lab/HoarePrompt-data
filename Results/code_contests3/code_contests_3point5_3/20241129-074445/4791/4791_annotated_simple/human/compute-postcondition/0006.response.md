Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then adds 1 to get the actual position. Since `j` must be less than `n-1` for the loop to execute one more time, we can assume the value of `j` is `n-2`. Therefore, the binary representation of `j + 1` is '0b101', and the rightmost set bit is at position 1, so the output will be 2.
Output State: **The output is 2**
