According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a valid integer. Since the error message indicates that 1 is being subtracted from a non-integer value, we need to ensure that `n` is an integer before the loop starts. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer.
State: **Error: Cannot subtract 1 from a non-integer value, `n` is an integer for the loop to execute**
