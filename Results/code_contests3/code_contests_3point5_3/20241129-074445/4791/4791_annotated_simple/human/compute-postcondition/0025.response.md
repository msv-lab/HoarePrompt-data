According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the output is the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` starting from the rightmost bit as 1-indexed. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **Output is the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` starting from the rightmost bit as 1-indexed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
