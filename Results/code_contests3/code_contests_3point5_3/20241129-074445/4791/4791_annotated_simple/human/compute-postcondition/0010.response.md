According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `n` is true. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered true. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be a non-zero integer. At the end of the last iteration, the output is always 2, `j` is `n-1`, and `n` is an integer.

State: **The output is always 2, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer and for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be a non-zero integer**
