According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is an integer, it will be able to execute the next time if `j` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the error occurred so we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` remains an integer and `j` is less than `n-1` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Error: Cannot subtract 1 from a non-integer value, `n` is an integer, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n-1**.
