According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j`, so the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `output` is 0, `j` is `n-2` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j` and `j` is now the starting value of the range which is `n-2`.
State: **`output` is 0, `j` is `n-2`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is a non-zero integer less than `j` and `j` is `n-2`**
