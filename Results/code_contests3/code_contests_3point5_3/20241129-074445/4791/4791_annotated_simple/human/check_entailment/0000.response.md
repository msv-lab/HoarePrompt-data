Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. 

1. The program reads the input `n` as a string using `input()`, but it should be converted to an integer using `int(input())`.
2. The program then enters a while loop that decrements `n` until it reaches 0, but the condition `while n` will not work correctly since `n` is a string and not an integer.
3. Inside the loop, the program tries to calculate the level of the passage connecting Room i and Room j, but the logic used (`print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)`) does not correspond to the problem requirements of setting levels to passages in a specific way to satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program does not follow the problem description and does not correctly set levels to the passages.
