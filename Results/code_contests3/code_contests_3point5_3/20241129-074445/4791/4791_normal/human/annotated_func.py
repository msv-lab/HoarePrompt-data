#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'n' is an integer greater than or equal to 0, 'j' is equal to 'n', the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of 'j + 1' is 'j + 1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input `n`, decrements `n` in a loop, and for each value of `n`, prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n`. However, the code contains an issue where it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input `n` without converting it to an integer, leading to a TypeError. This functionality is not reflected in the annotations.
