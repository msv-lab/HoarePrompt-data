According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the output of the code is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` should be equal to or greater than the updated `j` value.
State: **The output of the code is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is 1, `n` is 2**
