Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0 initially, `j + 1` is 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1', and the rightmost set bit is at position 1. Therefore, the output of the code will be 1.
Output State: **The output of the code is 1**
