According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 1. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the next value of `j`.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
