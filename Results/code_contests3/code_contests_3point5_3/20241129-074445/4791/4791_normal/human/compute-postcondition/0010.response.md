According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `j` from 0 up to `n-1`. The loop will execute one more time if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0**
