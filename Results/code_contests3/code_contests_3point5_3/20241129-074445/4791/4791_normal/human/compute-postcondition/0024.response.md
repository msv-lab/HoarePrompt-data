Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. The value of j is unknown, but it must be less than n for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
