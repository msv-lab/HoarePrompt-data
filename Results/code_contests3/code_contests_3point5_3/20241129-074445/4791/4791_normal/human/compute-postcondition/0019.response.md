According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-zero integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero integer greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1 for the loop to execute again**
