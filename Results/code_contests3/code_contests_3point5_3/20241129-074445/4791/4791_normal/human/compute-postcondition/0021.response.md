According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than 1 indicates that the loop will execute. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, no adjustments needed for the loop to execute**
