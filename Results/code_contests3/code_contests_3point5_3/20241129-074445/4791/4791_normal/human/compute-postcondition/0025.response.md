According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is equal to `n-1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, which means `j` should be `n` after incrementing by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time**
