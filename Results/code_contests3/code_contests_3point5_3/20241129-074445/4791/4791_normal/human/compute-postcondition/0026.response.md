Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, the binary representation of `j + 1` will have a set bit at position `j + 1` (since we are 1-indexing). Therefore, the position of the rightmost set bit will be `j + 1`, and the output will be `j + 1`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time. The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `j + 1`.**
