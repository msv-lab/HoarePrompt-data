According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1`**
