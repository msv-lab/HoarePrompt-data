According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is truthy (not an empty string or equivalent to False). Right before the loop, `n` is a string. In order for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be a non-empty string. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-empty string for the loop to execute the first time**
