Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. It finds the index of the rightmost '1' in the reversed binary string representation of `j + 1` and adds 1 to get the position. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact position of the rightmost set bit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1**
