The function `func` reads an input `n`, decrements `n` in a loop, and for each value of `n`, prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n`. However, the code contains an issue where it tries to perform arithmetic operations on the input `n` without converting it to an integer, leading to a TypeError. This functionality is not reflected in the annotations.
