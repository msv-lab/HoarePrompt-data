The given program does not correctly implement the logic to set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The program is using an incorrect approach to determine the level of the passage connecting Room i and Room j. This can lead to incorrect levels being set for the passages, violating the condition stated in the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input as 3:
The correct output should be:
```
1 1
1
```
But the program output will be different as it is not implementing the correct logic.
