#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the original input value of `n` is preserved throughout the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input value `n`, decrements it in a loop, and for each iteration, prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the current value of `n`. The function does not return any value. However, it seems that the code provided does not correctly handle the conversion from input to integer, as `input()` returns a string, and subtraction is attempted on it, which may result in a TypeError. Additionally, the code snippet in the for loop calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in a reversed binary representation, which might not yield the correct result.
