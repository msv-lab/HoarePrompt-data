Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not do what the problem description asks for. The program reads an input value `n` as a string, attempts to decrement it in a loop, and then prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the current value of `n`. This behavior is completely different from setting levels to the passages so that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even.

The program does not handle the setting of levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The code is incorrect and does not meet the specified requirements.
