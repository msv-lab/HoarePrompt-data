Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` after decreasing `j` by 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and represents the rightmost set bit position in the binary representation of `j` after decreasing `j` by 1, the output state will be:
Output State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1.**
