Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decreased by 1. The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned, but without knowing the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact position. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned after decreasing `n` by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned after decreasing `n` by 1**
