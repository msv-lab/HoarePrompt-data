According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a non-zero integer. The loop iterates from 0 to n-1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be a positive integer greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, so to adjust the state for the loop to execute the first time, `n` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
