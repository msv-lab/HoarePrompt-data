Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, but considering that `n` is a positive integer and the loop executes at least once, we can assume that `j` takes on a value greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned**
