Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1. If the initial value of `n` is a non-zero integer, after execution `n` will be one less than the initial value. If the initial value of `n` is 0, it will remain 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1 or `n` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1 or `n` is 0**
