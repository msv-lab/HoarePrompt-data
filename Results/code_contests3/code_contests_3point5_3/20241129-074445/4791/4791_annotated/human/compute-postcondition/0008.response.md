Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, where `j` should be less than `n`. The new value of `j` after each loop execution is `j + 1`. The output is the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 
Output State: **The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned.**
