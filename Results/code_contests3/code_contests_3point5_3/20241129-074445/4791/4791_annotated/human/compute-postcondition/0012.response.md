According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute. The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned after decreasing `n` by 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, to ensure the loop executes, `n` needs to be adjusted such that it is still a positive integer and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing it by 1 is considered.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1**.
