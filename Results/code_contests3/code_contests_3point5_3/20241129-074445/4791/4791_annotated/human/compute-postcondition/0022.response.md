Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` after reversing the binary string and finding the index of the first '1'. Since `n` is decreased by 1 before the calculation, the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is preserved. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1 is preserved.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1 is preserved**
