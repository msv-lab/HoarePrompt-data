According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, and the new `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n` and the new `j` should be `j + 1`**
