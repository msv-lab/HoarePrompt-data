According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `n` is a non-zero positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is returned**
