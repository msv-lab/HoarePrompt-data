According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0 after decreasing `n` by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` after decreasing `n` by 1**
