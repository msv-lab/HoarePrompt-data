Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. It then prints the position after finding the index of the rightmost set bit starting from the end of the string. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 in each loop iteration as long as it is less than `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned, where `j` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, and the new `j` should be `j + 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is returned, where `j` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time, and the new `j` should be `j + 1**.
