According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at indices that are not perfect squares set to True and elements at perfect square indices set to False. The count of True values in the sublist of `a` from index 1 to the square root of `n` (exclusive) is printed. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the input from `sys.stdin` should provide another value. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at indices that are not perfect squares set to True and elements at perfect square indices set to False, the count of True values in the sublist of `a` from index 1 to the square root of `n` (exclusive) is printed, input from `sys.stdin` is expected**
