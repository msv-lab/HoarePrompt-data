According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999, `j` is equal to `i`, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is set to False. Since `j` is equal to `i`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `i`. Therefore, the next iteration would require `j` to be equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `i + i` in list `a` to be set to False.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `i + i` in list `a` is set to False**
