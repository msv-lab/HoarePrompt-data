Example Answer:
All elements in the list `a` are assigned the value `True`, and the list has a length of 1000000. The variable `n` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to `True`.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to `True`**
