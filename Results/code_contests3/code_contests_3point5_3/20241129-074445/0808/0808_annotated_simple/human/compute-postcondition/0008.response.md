Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `j` is set to False. Since `j` is equal to `i`, the value at index `i` in list `a` is set to False. The initial state does not provide the value of `i`, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, all elements in list `a` from index 0 to 999999 are set to False except for the element at index `i` which is set to False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, all elements in list `a` from index 0 to 999999 are set to False except for the element at index `i` which is set to False**
