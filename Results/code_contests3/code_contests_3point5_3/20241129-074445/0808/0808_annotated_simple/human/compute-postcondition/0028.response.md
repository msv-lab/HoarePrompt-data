Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999 (current value + 1), `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False for all `i` that are not perfect squares. If the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is True, then there is no change in the state of the program.***
