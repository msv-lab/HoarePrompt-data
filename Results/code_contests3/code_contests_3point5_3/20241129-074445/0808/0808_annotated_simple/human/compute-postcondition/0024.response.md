Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is a perfect square value, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False for all `i` that are not perfect squares, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is within the valid indices of list `a`, `a[j]` is set to False**
