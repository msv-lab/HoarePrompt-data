According to the code, the loop will execute for all `i` values from 2 to 999,999. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed for `i` values from 2 to 999,998. The loop is now ready to execute for the next value of `i`, which is 999,999.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to True, except for elements at indices that are perfect squares, which are set to False after the execution of the if statement, for the loop to execute one more time `i` will be 999,999**
