Example Answer:
The element at index `j` in list `a` is set to False. Since `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False. Given that the list `a` has elements at perfect square indices set to False, and `i` is not necessarily a perfect square index, the state of the list `a` remains unchanged for indices other than `2*i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False**
