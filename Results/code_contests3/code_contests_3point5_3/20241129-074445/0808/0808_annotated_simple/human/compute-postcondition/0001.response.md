According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `i` from 2 to 999,999. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to `True`, which is the correct state. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to `True`**
