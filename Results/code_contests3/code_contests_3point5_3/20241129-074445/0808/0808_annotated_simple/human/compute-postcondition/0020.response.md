According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. If `i` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and 999,999. Since the loop is starting from 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be the current value of `i` + 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is between 1 and 999,999 (current value + 1), `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False for all `i` that are not perfect squares**.
