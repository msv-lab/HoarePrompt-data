Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `j` is set to False. Since `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and `i` is a perfect square, the element at index `j` in list `a` is set to False. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is a perfect square value, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False for all `i` that are not perfect squares, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is within the valid indices of list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with elements at perfect square indices set to False, `i` is a perfect square value, `j` is equal to `i` + `i`, and the element at index `2*i` in list `a` is set to False for all `i` that are not perfect squares, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is within the valid indices of list `a`**
