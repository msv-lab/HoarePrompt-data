According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if the range specified is valid. In this case, the loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to True, and the element at index `i-1` is True, which means the list is valid. To execute the loop, `i` should be such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. Additionally, `j` should be equal to `i ** 2 - 1` for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 elements, all set to True, the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True, for the loop to execute `i` should be such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000, `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1`**
