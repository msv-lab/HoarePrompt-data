According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, all elements in list `a` from index 0 to 999999 are set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value after the last iteration. 

Given `j` is initialized to `i ** 2 - 1` and incremented by `i` in each iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value after the last iteration. Therefore, `j` should be set to `i ** 2 + i - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, all elements in list `a` from index 0 to 999999 are set to False, `j` is `i ** 2 + i - 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
