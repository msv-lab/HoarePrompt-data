Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer n and then finds the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It correctly initializes a list of 1000000 elements with all values set to True initially. Then, it marks the indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers as False using the algorithm. Finally, it prints the count of True values up to the square root of n for each input.

The program satisfies the problem description by correctly counting the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n for any valid input.
