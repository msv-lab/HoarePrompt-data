The function `func` initializes a list `a` of 1000000 elements with True values. It then iterates over the range from 2 to 999,999, marking elements of the list `a` as False at indices that are perfect squares or multiples of prime numbers. After this process, it reads input values from `sys.stdin`, calculates the count of True values in the sublist of `a` from index 1 to the square root of each input value `s`, and prints this count. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
