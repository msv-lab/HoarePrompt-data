Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list `a` of size 1000000 with all elements set to True. It then iterates through the list to mark non-prime numbers as False based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. After that, the function enters an infinite loop reading integers from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in list `a` up to the integer read. The loop continues indefinitely until interrupted. The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified.**
