Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `a` is set to False. The loop will execute for the first time with `i` starting at 2, so `j` will be initialized to 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, the value at index 1 in list `a` will be set to False. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with all elements set to True except at index 1 which is False, `i` is 2, `a` at index 1 is False**
