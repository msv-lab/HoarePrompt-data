According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`, as well as the list `a`. 

1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is 999999, `j` is equal to `i + i`, and `a[j]` is set to False.
2. In the loop, `j` is incremented by `i` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1000000. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1000000.
3. Since `j` is equal to `i + i`, `j` should be less than 1000000. 
4. To achieve this, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` should be adjusted to a value where `j` is less than 1000000 in the given range for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated based on the new value of `i`**
