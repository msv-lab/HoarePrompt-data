According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`, as well as the elements in list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime. For the loop to execute one more time, the range from `i` should be such that all elements in list `a` up to index `j` are False. Since `j` is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, the next value of `j` should be the next multiple of `i` greater than the current `j`.

State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime, for the loop to execute one more time the range from `i` should ensure that all elements in list `a` up to index `j + i` are False**
