Example Answer:
The code `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in list `a`. Since all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are already False, this assignment does not change the state of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime, for the loop to execute one more time the range from `i` should ensure that all elements in list `a` up to index `j + i` are False.
Output State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime, for the loop to execute one more time the range from `i` should ensure that all elements in list `a` up to index `j + i` are False**
