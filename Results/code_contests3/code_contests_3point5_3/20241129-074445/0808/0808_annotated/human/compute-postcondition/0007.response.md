According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of the length of list `a` and `a[j]` is False. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range of the length of list `a`, and `a[j]` is False. Since the loop is going through indices starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, the next index `j` should still be within the range of the length of list `a` and `a[j]` should be False.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with all elements set to True except at index 1 which is False, `i` is 2, `a` at index 1 is False, `j` is within the range of the length of list `a` and `a[j]` is False for the next iteration**
