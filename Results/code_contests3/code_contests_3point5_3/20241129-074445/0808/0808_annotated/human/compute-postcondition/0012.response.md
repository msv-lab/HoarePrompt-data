According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `i` is a non-zero integer. Before the loop starts, n is not a prime number is given, which means `i` is not a prime number. Additionally, the loop will execute if the range `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 is valid. Since all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is a non-zero integer that is not a prime number. 
State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime**
