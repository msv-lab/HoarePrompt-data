According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. Since `i` is 999999, the loop will execute at least once. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is valid. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is still 999999, `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1`, and the range `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is valid. This means that `i ** 2 - 1` should be less than 1000000 and a prime number. Additionally, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 should remain False.

State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is 999999, `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is a valid range**
