According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `i` and `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value based on the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999999, `j` is equal to `i`, and `a[j]` is False. Since the loop updates `j` using the range `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, the next value for `j` would be `j + i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be updated to `j + i`.
State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is 999999, `j` is equal to `i + i`, `a[j]` is now False**
