According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the range specified. Since the loop iterates over the range from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 with a step of `i`, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the range to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, and `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime. For the loop to execute one more time, the range specified by `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 must have more elements to iterate over.

State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is a non-zero integer that is not prime, for the loop to execute one more time the range from `i ** 2` to 1000000 must have more elements to iterate over**
