Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 999,999. a is a list of 1,000,000 elements where the value at index i is True if i is not a prime number and False if i is a prime number. If a[i-1] is True, then n is a prime number and all elements in a up to index j are set to False where j is within the range of the length of list a.***
