According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False. Since the loop starts from 2, `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 999999.
State: **`n` is not a prime number, all elements in list `a` up to index 1000000 are False, `i` is 999999 for the loop to execute one more time**
