Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not read the input integers correctly. It uses `sys.stdin` to read input, but it does not handle the input correctly. It should read input using `input()` function instead of `sys.stdin`.
2. The program does not correctly count the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input integer `n`. The implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is incorrect, resulting in incorrect counts of prime numbers.
3. The program does not output the correct result for the given problem description. It does not follow the requirements of counting prime numbers less than or equal to the input integer `n`.
4. The program does not terminate after processing each dataset. It enters an infinite loop reading integers from `sys.stdin`, which is not the expected behavior based on the problem description.

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and does not produce the correct output.
