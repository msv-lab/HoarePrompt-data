Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input integer `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently determine prime numbers up to 999,999. The program iterates through the range of 2 to 999,999, marking all non-prime numbers as False in the `a` list. Then, for each input `n`, it counts the number of `True` values in the `a` list up to index `n`. This approach ensures that the program accurately counts prime numbers as specified in the problem description. Since the algorithm is correct and the program handles multiple datasets, the correctness is deemed to be true.
