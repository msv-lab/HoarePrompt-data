Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly initializes a list `a` of boolean values where `True` represents a prime number. It then iterates over the range from 2 to 999,999 and marks the multiples of prime numbers as `False`. Finally, for each input dataset, it prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number. The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it accurately counts the prime numbers as required. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
