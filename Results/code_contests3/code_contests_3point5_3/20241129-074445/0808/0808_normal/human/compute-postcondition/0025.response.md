According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with some elements set to `False`, `i` is a value less than or equal to sqrt(1000000) + 1. The loop updates `j` by adding `i` in each iteration starting from `i ** 2 - 1`. To execute the loop again, `j` should be less than 1000000 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with some elements set to `False`, `i` is a value less than or equal to sqrt(1000000) + 1 and the next value of `i` should be such that `i`, elements of list `a` have been set to `False`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than 1000000**
