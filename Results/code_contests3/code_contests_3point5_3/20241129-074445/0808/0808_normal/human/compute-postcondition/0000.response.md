Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized with 1000000 boolean `True` values. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 boolean True values.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 boolean True values**
