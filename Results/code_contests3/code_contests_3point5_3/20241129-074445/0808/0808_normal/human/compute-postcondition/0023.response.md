According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with some elements set to `False`, `i` is a value less than or equal to sqrt(1000000) + 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than 1000000. 

Given that `j` is currently equal to `i ** 2 - 1`, we need to adjust the state accordingly. We know that `i` is less than or equal to sqrt(1000000) + 1, hence the maximum value of `i` is 1001. Therefore, the maximum value of `i ** 2 - 1` is 1002000 - 1 = 1001999. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be less than 1000000. Therefore, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with some elements set to `False`, `i` is a value less than or equal to sqrt(1000000) + 1 and the next value of `i` should be such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000**
