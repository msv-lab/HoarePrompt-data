Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list `a` of 1000000 boolean values all set to True. It then iterates over the range from 2 to 999,999, setting elements in `a` to False if they are multiples of prime numbers up to 999,999. However, the function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value. Additionally, the function reads input from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in `a` from index 1 to the last value of each input provided.**
