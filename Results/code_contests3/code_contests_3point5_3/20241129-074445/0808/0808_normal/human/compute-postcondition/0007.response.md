According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. In this case, `j` is the loop variable and its value is determined by the range and step size. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i` which is 2, and `a[j]` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The value of `j` needs to be updated based on the range and step size defined in the loop.
2. The new value of `j` should be within the range from `i ** 2 - 1` to 999,999.
3. The element at index `j` in list `a` should be updated.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean True values, `i` is 2, `j` is the updated value based on the range and step size, `a[j]` is True**
