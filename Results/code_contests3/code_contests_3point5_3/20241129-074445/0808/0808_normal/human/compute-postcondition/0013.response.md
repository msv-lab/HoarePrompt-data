Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False`. Since the list `a` has 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`, the state of the list `a` changes so that the value at index `j` is now `False` while all other values remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i` except that now `a[j]` is `False`.**
