Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The list `a` contains 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`. After executing the code, the value at index `j` is set to `False`. The other values in the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`, `a[j]` is `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`, `a[j]` is `False`**
