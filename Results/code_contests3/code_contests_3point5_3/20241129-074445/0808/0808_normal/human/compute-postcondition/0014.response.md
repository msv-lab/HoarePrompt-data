According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the list `a`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a[j]` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i ** 2 - 1` should be less than 1000000, which means `i` must be such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with at least one `True` value at index `i`, `a[j]` is `False`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`**
