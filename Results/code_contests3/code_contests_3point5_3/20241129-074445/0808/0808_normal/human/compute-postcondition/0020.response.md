According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000000. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1000001.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with all elements set to `False`, `i` is 1000001**
