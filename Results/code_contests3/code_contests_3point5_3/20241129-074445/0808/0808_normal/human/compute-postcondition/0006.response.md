Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value False. The value of `j` is equal to 2 and `a[j]` was True, so after execution, `a[j]` is False. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean True values, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to i, `a[j]` is False.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean True values, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to i, `a[j]` is False**
