Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with some elements set to `False`, `i` is 1000001. If a[i - 1] is True, then all elements in `a` that are multiples of `i` have been set to `False` for all valid values of `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
