According to the code, the loop starts from 2 and goes up to 999999. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and should be less than 1000000. So, for the next iteration, `i` should be 1000000.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 boolean values, `i` is 1000000**
