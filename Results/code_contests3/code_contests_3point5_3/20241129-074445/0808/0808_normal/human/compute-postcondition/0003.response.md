According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. In this case, `j` is dependent on `i`. For the loop to execute, the range must start from a valid index within the list `a`. Since the (i-1)th element of list `a` is True, the loop will start at that index. Additionally, the loop must not exceed the length of list `a` which is 1000000. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial value of `j` must be a valid index within the list `a`, and the loop should not go beyond the length of list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean True values, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to (i ** 2 - 1), for the loop to execute the first time `j` must be a valid index within list `a` and the loop should not go beyond the length of list `a`**
