According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If the condition `a[j]` is False is met, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to (i, `a[j]` is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the condition `a[j]` is False must be met at the next iteration.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean True values, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to (i, `a[j]` is True**
