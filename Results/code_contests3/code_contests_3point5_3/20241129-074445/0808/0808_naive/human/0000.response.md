Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly generates a list `a` where each index represents a number and its value is `True` if the number is prime and `False` if it is not prime. The program then reads integers from the input and prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to that integer using the pre-generated list `a`. The logic of the program is correct and it handles the prime number calculation as described in the problem statement for all potential cases within the given constraints.
