Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It then shifts each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description. It iterates through each character of the input string, finds the index of that character in the alphabet, shifts it by N positions, wraps around if needed, and then constructs the new string based on the shifted characters.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and produces the correct output as expected.
