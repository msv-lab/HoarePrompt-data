Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`. Since `s` is the first character in `strings`, the index of `s` in `letters` will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is 0**
