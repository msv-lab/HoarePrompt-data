Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `new_strings`. The value of `new_strings` is not explicitly updated in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations from all the iterations of the loop, `s` is the last character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the last character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n` for the last character, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26 for the last character, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations from all the iterations of the loop, `s` is the last character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the last character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n` for the last character, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26 for the last character, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`**
