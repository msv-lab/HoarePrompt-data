Functionality: **The function prompts the user for an integer `n` and a non-empty string `strings`, then performs a Caesar cipher encryption on the input string based on the value of `n`. It shifts each letter in the input string by `n` positions in the alphabet and prints the resulting encrypted string. The function does not accept any parameters and only operates based on user input.**
