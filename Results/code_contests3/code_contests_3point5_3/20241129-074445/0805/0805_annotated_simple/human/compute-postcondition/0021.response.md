Example Answer:
`new_s` is added to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is calculated based on the value of `new_index`, which is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. The value of `index` is the index of the next character in `strings`. Therefore, after execution, `new_strings` will contain the characters calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the characters calculated based on the given formula**.
