Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value of the index of character `s` in the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string. The value of `s` is a character from `strings`, and `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', so `index` will be the position of `s` in the alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`**
