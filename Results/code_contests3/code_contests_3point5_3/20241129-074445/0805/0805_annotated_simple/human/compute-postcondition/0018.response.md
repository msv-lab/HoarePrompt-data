Example Answer:
The value of `added_index` is calculated by adding `index` and `n`. The other variables are not affected by this calculation. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index` for the loop to execute one more time `s` should be the next character in `strings`**.
