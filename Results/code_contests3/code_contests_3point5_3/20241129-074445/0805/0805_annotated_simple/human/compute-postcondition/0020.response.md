Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string at the index `new_index`. The value of `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`**
