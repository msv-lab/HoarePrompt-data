According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s` iterating through the characters in `strings`. At the end of the last iteration, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `strings` should be available. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the next character, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index` for the loop to execute one more time `s` should be the next character in `strings`**
