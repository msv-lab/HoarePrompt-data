Example Answer:
`new_index` is calculated as the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. The value of `new_index` will be between 0 and 25. Then, `new_s` is assigned the character at the index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The `letters` string contains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', so `new_s` will be a character from this string based on the calculated `new_index`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is 0, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is a character from the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string based on `new_index`.**
