Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer `n` and a string `strings` as input. It then shifts each character of the string `strings` by `n` in alphabetical order as described in the problem description. The program correctly handles the shifting by calculating the new index of each character after the shift and appending the corresponding character to `new_strings`.

The program uses the modulo operator to handle cases where the sum of the index and `n` exceeds 26, ensuring that the shifting wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases by correctly shifting each character in the input string and producing the expected output.
