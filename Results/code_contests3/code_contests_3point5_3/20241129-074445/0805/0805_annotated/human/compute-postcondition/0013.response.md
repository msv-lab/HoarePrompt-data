Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, and `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n`, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `added_index` in the `letters` string, `new_index` is the value of `added_index` modulo 26.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n`, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `added_index` in the `letters` string, `new_index` is the value of `added_index` modulo 26**
