Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `new_index` is the sum of `index` and `n` modulo 26. All other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n` and the updated value after concatenating, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n` and the updated value after concatenating, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string**
