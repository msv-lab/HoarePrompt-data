Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, and `n` is the input integer. Therefore, the value of `added_index` is the sum of the two. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty) with at least one more character, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n`, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `added_index` in the `letters` string.**
