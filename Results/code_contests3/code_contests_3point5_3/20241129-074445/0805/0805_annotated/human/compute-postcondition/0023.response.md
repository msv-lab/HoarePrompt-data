Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `new_strings` which is the result string after applying the transformation to each character in `strings` based on `n`. The initial state includes `n` as an input integer, `strings` as the input string, `letters` as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `new_strings` as the result string. 
Output State: **The value of `new_strings` is printed after applying the transformation to each character in `strings` based on `n`**
