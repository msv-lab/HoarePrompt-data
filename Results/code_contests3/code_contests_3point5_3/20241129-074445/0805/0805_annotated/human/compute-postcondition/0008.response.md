Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `new_index` is calculated by taking the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. The initial values are: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string.**
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string.**
