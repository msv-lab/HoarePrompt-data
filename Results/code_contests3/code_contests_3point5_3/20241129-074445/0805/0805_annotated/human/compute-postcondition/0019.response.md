Example Answer:
`new_index` is calculated as the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`. The value of `new_index` will be between 0 and 25. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n` and the updated value after concatenating `new_s`, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n,` `new_s` is the character at index `added_index` in the `letters` string, `new_index` is the value of `added_index` modulo 26, `new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the concatenation of characters based on the value of `n` and the updated value after concatenating `new_s`, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n,` `new_s` is the character at index `added_index` in the `letters` string, `new_index` is the value of `added_index` modulo 26, `new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` string**
