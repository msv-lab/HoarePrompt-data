Example Answer:
The value of `index` is calculated by finding the index of the first character in `strings` in the string `letters`. Then, `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`**
