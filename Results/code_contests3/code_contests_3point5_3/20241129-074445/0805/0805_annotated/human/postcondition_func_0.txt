The function reads an integer `n` and a string `strings`, then applies a transformation to each character in `strings` based on the value of `n`. The transformed characters are concatenated to form a new string `new_strings`, which is then printed. The transformation involves shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.
