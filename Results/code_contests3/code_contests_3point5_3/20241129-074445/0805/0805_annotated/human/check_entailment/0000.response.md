Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer `n` and a string `strings`, then applies a transformation to each character in `strings` based on the value of `n`. The transformation involves shifting each character by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The result is then printed. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for all test cases.
