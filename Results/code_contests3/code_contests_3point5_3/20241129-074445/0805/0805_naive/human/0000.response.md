Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer N and a string S as input, then shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles all uppercase English letters and shifts them according to the given constraints (0 <= N <= 26).

The program iterates through each character in the input string S, finds the index of that character in the 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' string, adds the shift value N, calculates the new index by taking modulus 26, and then finds the new character based on the new index. This logic ensures that the characters are shifted correctly.

For all the given examples, the program produces the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and the correctness is **True**.
