Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at the index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `n` is used to calculate the new index, which is obtained by adding `n` to the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, then taking the modulus 26 of the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, `new_s` is the character at the new index.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, `new_s` is the character at the new index**
