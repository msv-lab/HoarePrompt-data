Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. The value of `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, which ranges from 0 to 25. Therefore, after calculating `added_index`, `new_index` will be the remainder of the division by 26. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26**
