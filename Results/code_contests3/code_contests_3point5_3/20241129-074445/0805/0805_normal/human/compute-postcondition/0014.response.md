Example Answer:
The value of `new_s` is assigned the character at the index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The index `new_index` is calculated as the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. Given the initial state values, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, and `new_s` is the character at the new index in the `letters` string for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character at the new index in the `letters` string for the next iteration of the loop**
