Example Answer:
The code snippet prints out the value of `new_strings`. The transformation described in the loop involves calculating the new index for each character in the `strings` string based on the value of `n`. The new index is calculated by adding `n` to the index of each character in the `letters` string, taking the remainder when divided by 26, and then determining the character at that index. The output will be the new transformed string based on the described transformation.
Output State: **Prints the new transformed string `new_strings` based on the transformation described in the loop**
