Example Answer: 
`new_strings` is initialized as an empty string. The values of `n`, `strings`, and `letters` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string**
