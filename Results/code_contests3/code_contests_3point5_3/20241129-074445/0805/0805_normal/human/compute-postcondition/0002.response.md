Example Answer:
The variable `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The values of `n` and `strings` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
