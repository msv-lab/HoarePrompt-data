According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `strings` input string is not empty. So, for the loop to execute, the `strings` input string must not be empty. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `new_strings` is an empty string. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `strings` should not be empty.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string (not empty), `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string**.
