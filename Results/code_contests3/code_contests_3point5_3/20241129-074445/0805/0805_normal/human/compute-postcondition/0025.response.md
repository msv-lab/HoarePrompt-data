Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, then reads a string `strings`. It performs a character transformation on each character in `strings` based on the value of `n` by shifting each character in the string `letters`. The transformed string is printed as output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have any return value. **
