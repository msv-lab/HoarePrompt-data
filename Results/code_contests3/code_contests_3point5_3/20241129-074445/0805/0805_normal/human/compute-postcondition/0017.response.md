Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` as an input integer, `strings` assigned the input string, `letters` containing 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` with the added character at the new index, and other variables not mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string**
