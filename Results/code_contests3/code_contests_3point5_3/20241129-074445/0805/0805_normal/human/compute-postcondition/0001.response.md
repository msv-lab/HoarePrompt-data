Example Answer:
The variable `strings` is assigned the value of the input string. Since `n` is an input integer and is not directly used in the code snippet, the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string**
