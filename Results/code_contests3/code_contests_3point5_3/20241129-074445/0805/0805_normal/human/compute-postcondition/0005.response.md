Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`. The value of `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and assuming `s` is a character from this string, `index` will be the index of that character in the string. The variables `n`, `strings`, and `new_strings` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`**
