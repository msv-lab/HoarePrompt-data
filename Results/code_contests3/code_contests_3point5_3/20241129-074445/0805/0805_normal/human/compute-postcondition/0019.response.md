Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string and `n` is the input integer. Since `letters` contains 26 characters, `new_index` will be in the range of 0 to 25. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
