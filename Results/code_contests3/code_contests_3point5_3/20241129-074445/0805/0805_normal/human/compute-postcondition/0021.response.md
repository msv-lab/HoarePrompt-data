Example Answer:
The character `new_s` is added to the `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is determined by the calculations `new_index = (index + n) % 26`. The values of `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` are used for this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at the new index.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at the new index**
