Example Answer:
The character at the new index in the `letters` string is added to `new_strings`. The variables `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character at the new index in the `letters` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the added character at the new index, `index` is the index of character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character at the new index in the `letters` string**
