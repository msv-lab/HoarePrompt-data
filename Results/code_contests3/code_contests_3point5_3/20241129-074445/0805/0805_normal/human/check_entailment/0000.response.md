Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer `n` as input and a string `strings` as input. It then shifts each character in the string `strings` by `n` in alphabetical order. The code correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 0 or the length of the string is up to 10^4. The shifting is done by finding the index of each character in the `letters` string, adding `n` to it, and then taking the modulus to ensure it wraps around if it exceeds 26. This accurately represents the problem description and provides the correct output. The output hints also confirm that the code performs the character transformation as described.
