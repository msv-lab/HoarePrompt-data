Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given proportions and ingredients he has at his disposal. The program uses a complex nested lambda function to perform this calculation, which ultimately results in the correct output.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
