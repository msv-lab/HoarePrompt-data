Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes input and splits it, and `map(int, ...)` converts the input values to integers. The values of `n` and `V` are positive integers, so the output state is: n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. `ai` and `bi` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100.
Output State: **n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. ai and bi are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100.**
