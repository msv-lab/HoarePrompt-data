Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of floating-point numbers converted from user input using `raw_input().split()`. Similarly, `b` is also assigned a list of floating-point numbers converted from user input. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `a` is a list of floating-point numbers, `b` is a list of floating-point numbers.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `a` is a list of floating-point numbers, `b` is a list of floating-point numbers**
