Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates a result based on a complex nested lambda function, but the purpose or meaning of this calculation is not clear from the code provided. The function does not have a specified return value. The annotations provide information about the expected input values, constraints, and data types, but the actual functionality of the function based on the code is not explicitly described. **
