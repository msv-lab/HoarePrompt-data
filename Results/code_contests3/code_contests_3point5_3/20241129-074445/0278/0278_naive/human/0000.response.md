Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for n, V, a, and b. It then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook as per the given conditions. The program uses a lambda function and the reduce function to calculate the minimum proportion of ingredients to use for each ingredient and then determines the total volume of soup that can be cooked. The program handles the given constraints of n, V, ai, and bi. Additionally, the output has the required precision of less than 10^-4. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the examples provided, we can conclude that the program is correct.
