Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values, calculates the minimum amount of soup that can be cooked based on the proportions of ingredients and the available amounts, and then outputs the volume of soup that can be cooked up to the maximum pan volume V.

The program uses the reduce function to find the minimum proportion of ingredients available for each ingredient, then multiplies it by the proportion of that ingredient needed for the soup, and finally sums up all the ingredients to get the total volume of soup that can be cooked.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
