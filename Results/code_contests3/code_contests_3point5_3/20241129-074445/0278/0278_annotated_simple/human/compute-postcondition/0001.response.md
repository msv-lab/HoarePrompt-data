Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values after converting the input strings to float values. The values of `a` and `b` are dependent on the input provided, so the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of ingredients, V is a positive integer representing the volume of the pan, ai are positive integers representing the proportions of ingredients, bi are non-negative integers representing the available amounts of ingredients, a and b are assigned float values based on user input.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of ingredients, V is a positive integer representing the volume of the pan, ai are positive integers representing the proportions of ingredients, bi are non-negative integers representing the available amounts of ingredients, a and b are assigned float values based on user input**
