Example Answer:
n and V are assigned the values of map(int, raw_input().split()), where map(int, raw_input().split()) accepts multiple inputs and converts them to integers. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the ingredients proportions and available amounts, the output state will be: n is a positive integer representing the number of ingredients, V is a positive integer representing the volume of the pan, ai are positive integers representing the proportions of ingredients, and bi are non-negative integers representing the available amounts of ingredients.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of ingredients, V is a positive integer representing the volume of the pan, ai are positive integers representing the proportions of ingredients, and bi are non-negative integers representing the available amounts of ingredients.**
