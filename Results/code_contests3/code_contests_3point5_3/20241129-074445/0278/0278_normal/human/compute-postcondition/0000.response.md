Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, and `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000, the values of `n` and `V` will be within these ranges.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000**
