Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the given problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the input number is not prime (composite) and then calculates the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands. The program also correctly handles cases where the input number is less than any composite number and prints -1. Overall, the program follows the problem description and gives the expected output for all cases.
