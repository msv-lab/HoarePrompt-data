Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. It checks if the input number is odd, and if so, subtracts 9 from it and adds 1 to the count of composite summands. Then it checks if the remaining number is not a prime number and calculates the maximum possible number of composite summands by dividing the number by 4. The program also correctly handles cases where the input number is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11 by outputting -1. Since all potential cases are covered and correctly handled, the program is considered correct.
