Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it correctly represents the given integer as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. It handles the case where the integer is odd by subtracting 9 and setting `c` to 1. It then calculates the result based on the condition provided in the problem description and prints either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`. The program covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each query.
