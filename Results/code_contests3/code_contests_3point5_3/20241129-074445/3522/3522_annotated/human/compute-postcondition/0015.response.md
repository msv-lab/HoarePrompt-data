According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input value. At the end of the last iteration, the state depends on the initial value of `a`. To determine the states needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `a`. If `a` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **Depends on the initial value of `a`, for the loop to execute one more time `a` must be greater than 1**
