Example Answer:
If `a` is not divisible by 2, `c` is set to 1 and `a` is decreased by 9. Otherwise, `c` remains 0. Then, based on the value of `a`, either -1 is printed if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), or `a / 4 + c` is printed. 
Output State: **`c` is 0 or 1, `a` is an integer. If `a` is not divisible by 2, `c` is set to 1 and `a` is decreased by 9. Otherwise, `c` remains 0. The printed value is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`**
