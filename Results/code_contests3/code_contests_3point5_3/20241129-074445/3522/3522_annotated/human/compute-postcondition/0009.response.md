Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the input value. Depending on whether the input value meets the condition a % 2 != 0, the next values of `a` and `c` will be determined. Since we do not have the specific input value, we cannot calculate the next values of `a` and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `a` is assigned the input value, and the next values of `a` and `c` will depend on the specific input value and the condition a % 2 != 0.
Output State: **The value of `a` is assigned the input value, and the next values of `a` and `c` will depend on the specific input value and the condition a % 2 != 0.**
