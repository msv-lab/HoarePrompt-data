According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a`. If `a` meets the condition a % 2 != 0, then a is decreased by 9 and c is set to 1. Otherwise, no change in the values of a and c. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `a` is unknown. To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the possible values of `a` based on the condition provided.

If a % 2 != 0, then a is decreased by 9 and c is set to 1. This implies that if the previous value of `a` met this condition, then for the loop to execute again, the new value of `a` should be such that a % 2 != 0. 

If a % 2 == 0, then there is no change in the values of `a` and `c`. This implies that if the previous value of `a` did not meet this condition, then for the loop to execute again, the new value of `a` should still not meet this condition.

Considering the condition to print -1 if a is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else print a / 4 + c, we can deduce the possible values of `a` and `c` for the next iteration.

State: **The next value of `a` and `c` will depend on whether the current value of `a` meets the condition a % 2 != 0 or not, and the specific values of `a` and `c` will determine the output for the next iteration.**
