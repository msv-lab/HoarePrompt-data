Example Answer:
If `a` is assigned an input value and is odd, then `a` is decremented by 9 and `c` is assigned the value 1. If `a` is even, there is no change in the values of `a` and `c`. Then, we print -1 if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise we print the result of a divided by 4 plus `c`. The final output depends on the initial value of `a`. 
Output State: **Depends on the initial value of `a`**
