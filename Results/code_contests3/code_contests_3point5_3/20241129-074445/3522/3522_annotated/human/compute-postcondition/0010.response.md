Example Answer:
The value of `c` is initialized to 0. The values of `a` and `c` will depend on the specific input value and the condition a % 2 != 0. Without knowing the input value, we cannot determine the exact values of `a` and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `a` is assigned the input value, `c` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **The value of `a` is assigned the input value, `c` is initialized to 0**
