You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given several queries. In the i-th query you are given a single positive integer ni. You are to represent ni as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.

An integer greater than 1 is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to 1 and the integer itself.

Input

The first line contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of queries.

q lines follow. The (i + 1)-th line contains single integer ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 109) — the i-th query.

Output

For each query print the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands, or -1, if there are no such splittings.

Examples

Input

1
12


Output

3


Input

2
6
8


Output

1
2


Input

3
1
2
3


Output

-1
-1
-1

Note

12 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 4 + 8 = 6 + 6 = 12, but the first splitting has the maximum possible number of summands.

8 = 4 + 4, 6 can't be split into several composite summands.

1, 2, 3 are less than any composite number, so they do not have valid splittings.
Function definition:
```
def func():
```
