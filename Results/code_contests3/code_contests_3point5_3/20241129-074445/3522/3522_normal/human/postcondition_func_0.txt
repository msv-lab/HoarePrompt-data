The function does not accept any parameters and iterates over a range of values obtained from user input. For each input value `a`, it checks if `a` is odd, subtracts 9 and sets `c` to 1 if it is. Then, it prints -1 if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`. However, there is a potential missing functionality as the code does not handle the case when the input values are not integers. Additionally, the code does not account for division by zero when `a` is 0.
