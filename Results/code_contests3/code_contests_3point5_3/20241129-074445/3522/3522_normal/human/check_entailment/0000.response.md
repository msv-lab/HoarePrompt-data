Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for the number of queries and then iterates over each query.
- For each query, it checks if the number is odd and subtracts 9 from it, setting a flag `c` to 1 if it is odd.
- It then checks if the number is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} and prints -1 if it is.
- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible number of summands by performing `a / 4 + c` and prints the result.
- The code correctly represents a number as a sum of composite summands and handles the cases where the number cannot be represented as such. 
- The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
