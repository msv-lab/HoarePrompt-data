Example Answer: 
Variable `c` is directly assigned the value 1. The value of `a` is not directly affected by this code snippet. However, it is mentioned that the initial value of `a` is not divisible by 2 and it is decremented by 9. Therefore, the final value of `a` will be odd and 8 less than the initial value. The output state after running the code is: `a` is an odd number 8 less than the initial value, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is an odd number 8 less than the initial value, `c` is 1**
