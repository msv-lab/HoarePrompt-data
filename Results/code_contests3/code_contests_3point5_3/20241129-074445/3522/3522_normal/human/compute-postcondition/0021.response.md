Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is the return value of `input()`. If `a` is not divisible by 2, then `a` is assigned the return value of `input()` - 9. If `a` is greater than -9, the loop will execute one more time. `c` is assigned 1. The print statement outputs -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and `a / 4 + c` otherwise.

Output State: **`a` is the return value of input(). If `a` % 2 != 0, then `a` is the return value of input() - 9, `c` is 1, the print statement outputs either -1 or `a / 4 + 1`. The loop will execute one more time if `a` is greater than -9.**
