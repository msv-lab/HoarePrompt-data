According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the return value of input(). If the input value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the return value of input(), `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a`, the print statement outputs either -1 or `a / 4 + c`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the new `a` value from the input must be greater than 0.
State: **`a` is the return value of input(), `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a`, the print statement outputs either -1 or `a / 4 + c`, for the loop to execute one more time `a` must be greater than 0**
