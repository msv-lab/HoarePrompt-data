Example Answer:
The value of `c` is assigned 0. The value of `a` is unknown as it is assigned the return value of `input()`. Since the loop executes one more time only if the input value is greater than 0, the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned the return value of input(), `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the return value of input(), `c` is 0**
