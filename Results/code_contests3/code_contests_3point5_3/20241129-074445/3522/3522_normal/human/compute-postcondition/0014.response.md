Example Answer:
The value of `a` is the return value of `input()`, and `c` is initially 0. If `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. The print statement checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then it prints -1, otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.

Output State: **`a` is the return value of input(), `c` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a`, the print statement outputs either -1 or `a / 4 + c`**
