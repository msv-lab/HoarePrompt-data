The function does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a range of values provided by the user and modifies each input value `a` based on whether it is odd or even. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1. Then, it checks if the modified `a` is in a specific set of numbers and prints -1 if it is, otherwise it calculates `a` divided by 4 and adds `c` to the result. The function does not have a specific return value.
