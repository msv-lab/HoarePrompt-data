Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It first checks if the input number is odd, then subtracts 9 from it and adds 1 to the count variable `c`. Then, it checks if the modified number is in the list of prime numbers, and if not, it calculates the maximum possible number of summands by dividing by 4 and adding `c` to it. This logic correctly represents the input number as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands as required by the problem description.
