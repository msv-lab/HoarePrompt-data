Example Answer:
If `a` is not divisible by 2, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is one of the values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed. 
Output State: **If `a` is not divisible by 2, `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is one of the values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed.**
