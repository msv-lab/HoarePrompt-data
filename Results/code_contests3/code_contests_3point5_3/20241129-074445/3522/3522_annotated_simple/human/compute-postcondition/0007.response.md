Example Answer:
If `a` is an odd number, `c` is set to 1. If `a` is an even number, `c` remains unchanged. The code then prints -1 if `a` is in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`. 
Output State: **`a` is an input value greater than 0, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, otherwise `c` remains unchanged**.
