According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the input value `a` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates based on the input value, for the loop to execute one more time, the input value needs to be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is an input value greater than 1, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, otherwise `c` remains unchanged**
