Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to iterate over the digits of the integer `n`, but since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, it cannot be directly iterated like a string. Therefore, the code will result in an error. The output state will reflect this error.
Output State: **Error: 'int' object is not iterable**
