Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to accept a positive integer `n` greater than 0 as input. However, the code inside the function attempts to lowercase the input `n` after filtering out non-alphabetic characters, and then it tries to check if the modified `n` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. Due to an error where an 'int' object is not iterable, the function does not behave as expected and does not provide a valid output. **
