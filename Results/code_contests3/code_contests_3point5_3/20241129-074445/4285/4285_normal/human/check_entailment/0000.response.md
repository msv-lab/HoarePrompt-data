Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not align with the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but the code inside the function is attempting to check if a modified version of the input number `n` is a palindrome, which is not at all related to the task described. Also, the description mentions that the input `n` will be a positive integer, but the code filters out non-alphabetic characters, which is not necessary for this task. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for any potential case.
