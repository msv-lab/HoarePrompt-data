#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.**
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string x is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n, extracts the alphabetic characters from the string representation of n, converts them to lowercase, and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns True if the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False. However, the function does not handle cases where n is not a string or does not contain alphabetic characters, which could lead to errors.
