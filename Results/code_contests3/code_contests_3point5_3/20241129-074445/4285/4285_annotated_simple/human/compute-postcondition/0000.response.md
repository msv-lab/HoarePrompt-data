Example Answer:
The code converts the value of `n` to a string, then iterates over each character, converts it to lowercase if it is an alphabet character, and joins all characters together. Since `n` is a positive integer, the value of `x` will be an empty string as there are no alphabet characters in a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000, x is an empty string.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000, x is an empty string**
