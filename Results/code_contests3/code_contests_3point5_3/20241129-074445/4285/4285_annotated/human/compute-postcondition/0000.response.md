Example Answer:
The code snippet iterates over each character in the string representation of the positive integer `n`. It converts each character to lowercase if it is an alphabet character. Since `n` is a positive integer, we can assume it does not contain any alphabetic characters. Therefore, the output of the code snippet will be an empty string since no characters in `n` are alphabetic.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an empty string**
