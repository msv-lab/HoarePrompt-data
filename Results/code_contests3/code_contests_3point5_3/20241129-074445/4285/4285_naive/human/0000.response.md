Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The function `func_1` is attempting to check if a given string is a palindrome, not generate the n-th even-length palindrome number. This is evident from the code logic that checks if the input string is equal to its reverse, which is the condition for a palindrome.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
