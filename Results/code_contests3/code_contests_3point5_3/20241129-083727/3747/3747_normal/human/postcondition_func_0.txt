The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user input. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the integer 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of length 101 filled with zeros. It iterates through the list `a` and updates the occurrences of each element in list `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum value in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
