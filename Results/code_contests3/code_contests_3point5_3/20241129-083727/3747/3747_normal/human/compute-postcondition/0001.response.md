Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of integers converted from the input received by splitting the input string. Since `n` is an input integer, after execution, `a` will contain a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
