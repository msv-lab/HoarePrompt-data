Example Answer:
The code prints the maximum value in the list `c`. The list `c` has 101 integers with each value at index `d` increased by the number of occurrences of `d` in list `a`. The initial value of `n` and `a` are not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 11, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the value at each index `d` increased by the number of occurrences of `d` in list `a` and the maximum value in `c` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is 11, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the value at each index `d` increased by the number of occurrences of `d` in list `a` and the maximum value in `c` is printed**
