The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is 11, `a` still has elements to iterate through, and `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d+1` increased by 1. After execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is 11, `a` still has elements to iterate through, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` increased by 1**
