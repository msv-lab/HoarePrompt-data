According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `a` is a list of integers, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer in the list. 

State: **`n` is 11, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
