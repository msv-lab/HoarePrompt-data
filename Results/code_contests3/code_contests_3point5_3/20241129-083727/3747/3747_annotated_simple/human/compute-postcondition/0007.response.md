Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the first element in list `a`, so `d` is updated to the value of the first element in list `a`. Then, the value of `c` at index `d` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is the first element in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is the first element in list `a`**
