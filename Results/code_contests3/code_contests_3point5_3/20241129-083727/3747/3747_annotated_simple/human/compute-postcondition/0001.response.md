Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of integers after mapping the input values that are split by spaces. The previous value of `n` is an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
