Example Answer:
`c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the second element of list `a`, so `d` is the second element of list `a`. `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is the second element in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is the second element in list `a`**
