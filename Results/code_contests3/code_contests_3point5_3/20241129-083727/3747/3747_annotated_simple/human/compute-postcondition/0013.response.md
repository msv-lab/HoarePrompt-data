Example Answer:
The code prints the maximum value in list `c`, which represents the frequency of each index in list `a`. Since `c` has 101 elements and each element represents the frequency of that index in list `a`, the maximum value in `c` will be the highest frequency. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with each element representing the frequency of that index in list `a`, `d` is the last element in list `a`, and the maximum frequency in list `c` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with each element representing the frequency of that index in list `a`, `d` is the last element in list `a`, and the maximum frequency in list `c` is printed**
