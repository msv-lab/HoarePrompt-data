Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, followed by a list of integers `a`. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the value 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of size 101 and increments the frequency of each element in list `a` in the corresponding index of list `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum value in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
