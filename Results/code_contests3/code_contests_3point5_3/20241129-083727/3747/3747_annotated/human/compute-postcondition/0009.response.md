Example Answer:
The element at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements left in list `a` to iterate over and the next element to be iterated over is present in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros where the element at index `d` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros where the element at index `d` has been incremented by 1**
