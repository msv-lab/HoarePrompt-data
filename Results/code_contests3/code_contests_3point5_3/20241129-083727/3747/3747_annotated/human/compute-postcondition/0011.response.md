The code snippet `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` in the list `c` by 1. As `c` is a list of 101 zeros where the element at index `d` has been incremented by 1, after running the code, the element at index `d` in list `c` will be further incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one more element to iterate, `c` is a list of 101 zeros where the element at index `d` has been incremented by 2**
