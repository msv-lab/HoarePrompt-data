Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins as described in the problem statement. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```
The expected output is 2, but the program will output 3. This is because the program does not consider the fact that two coins with the same value cannot be put into the same pocket. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
