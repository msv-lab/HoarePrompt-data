Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in. The calculation involves applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times `n` to the sine of pi divided by 2 times `n`, which aligns with the problem description. The function returns the correct result for any given odd integer `n` within the specified range.
