#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.**
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times n to the sine of pi divided by 2 times n, where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and returns the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times `n` to the sine of pi divided by 2 times `n`.
