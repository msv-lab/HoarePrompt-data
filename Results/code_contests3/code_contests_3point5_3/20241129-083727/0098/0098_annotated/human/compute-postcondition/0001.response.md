The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The program returns the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times n to the sine of pi divided by 2 times n, where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and return the result of the specified mathematical operation. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199, and returns the result of applying the specified mathematical operation involving cosine and sine.**
