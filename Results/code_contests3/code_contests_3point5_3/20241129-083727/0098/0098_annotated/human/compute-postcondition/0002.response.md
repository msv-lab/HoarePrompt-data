Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and returns the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times `n` to the sine of pi divided by 2 times `n`.** 

The function does not include error handling for cases where `n` is not an odd integer or falls outside the range of 3 to 199. The actual code only calculates the specified mathematical operation without checking if `n` meets the conditions mentioned in the annotations.
