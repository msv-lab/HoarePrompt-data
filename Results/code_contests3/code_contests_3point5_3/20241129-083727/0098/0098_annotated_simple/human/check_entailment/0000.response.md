Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula provided in the problem description to calculate the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in. The program takes an odd integer n as input and returns the result of the calculation `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`, which is the expected output according to the problem description. The program covers all possible cases where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199, as required by the problem.
