Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is missing the necessary logic to calculate the square of the minimum size in which the 2n-gon can be embedded. The function `func_1` only calculates and returns a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer `n` provided. It does not actually solve the problem of finding the minimum size square to embed the 2n-gon.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
