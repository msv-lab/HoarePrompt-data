The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer `n` provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and return the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine based on specific angles.
