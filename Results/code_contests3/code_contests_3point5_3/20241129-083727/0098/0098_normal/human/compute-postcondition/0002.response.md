Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199. It then calculates and returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer `n` provided.** 

It's worth noting that the annotations mention that `n` is an odd integer within a specific range, which is crucial for the function's correct execution. Additionally, the use of the `math` library implies that the function relies on mathematical calculations involving cosine and sine functions.
