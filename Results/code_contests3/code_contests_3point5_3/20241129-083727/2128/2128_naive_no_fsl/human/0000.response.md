Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels based on the given constraints. It first sorts the barrels in descending order and then iterates through the barrels to pour water as required. The logic for handling the case when k is greater than or equal to n ensures that the correct result is obtained. The program outputs the correct answer for the provided examples and should work for all possible cases within the given constraints.
