The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts `arr` in reverse order, calculates the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of `arr`, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
