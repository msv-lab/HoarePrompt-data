Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the first element of the list `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
