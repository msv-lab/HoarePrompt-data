According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a certain value and `t` is another value. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and `t` should remain the same.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i+1` are integers and the value of `ans` is the sum of the first `k + 1` elements of the updated list `arr`**
