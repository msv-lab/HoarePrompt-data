Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the list `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` remain unchanged after executing the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the list `arr`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the list `arr`**.
