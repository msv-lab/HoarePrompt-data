Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order. The order of the elements in the list `arr` is changed, but the values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order**
