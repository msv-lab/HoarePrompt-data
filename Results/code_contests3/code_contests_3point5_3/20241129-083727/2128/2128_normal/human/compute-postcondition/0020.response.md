Example Answer: 
The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order using the `sorted()` function. Since `arr` was already in reverse order, the sorting does not change its order. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the updated list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the updated list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`**
