Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k`, and `i+1` are integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is updated to `n - 1`.***
