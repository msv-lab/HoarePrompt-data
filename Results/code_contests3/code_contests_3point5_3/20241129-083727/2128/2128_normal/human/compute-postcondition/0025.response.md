Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `l + 1` elements of the updated list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`, if `k >= n`, then `k` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 1**
