Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of the list `arr`. As `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `l` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `ans` will keep adding elements from the list `arr` in each iteration. 
Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first two elements of the list `arr` plus the elements at index 0 to l of the list `arr` where l is the number of iterations.**
