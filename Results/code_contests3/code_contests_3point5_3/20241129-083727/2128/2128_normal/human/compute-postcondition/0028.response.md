According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` are updated, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 2. 

State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` are updated, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 2**
