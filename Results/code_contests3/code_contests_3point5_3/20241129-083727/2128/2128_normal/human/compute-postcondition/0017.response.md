According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the values are as follows: `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the list `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to the next value in the range. So, at the start of the next iteration, the state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`**
