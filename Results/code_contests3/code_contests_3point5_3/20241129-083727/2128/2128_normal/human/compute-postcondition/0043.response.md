According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k+1` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are updated to `n - 1`, `i+1`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the first element of the updated `arr`, for the loop to execute `k+1` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l+1` of the updated `arr`, `ans` is further incremented by the value at index `l` of the updated `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k+1` must be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, `i+1`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the first element of the updated `arr`, for the loop to execute `k+1` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n+1**
