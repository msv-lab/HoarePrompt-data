Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of array `arr`. The previous values of `ans` and `arr` are unknown, so the output state is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 2.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `n` and at least 2**
