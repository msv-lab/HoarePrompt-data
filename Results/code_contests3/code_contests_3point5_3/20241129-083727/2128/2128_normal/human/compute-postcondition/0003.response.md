Example Answer:
The code reads input from the standard input, splits it using a space, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers**
