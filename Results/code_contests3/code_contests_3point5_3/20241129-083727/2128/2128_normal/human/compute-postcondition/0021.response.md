Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `arr`, which is in reverse order. The value of `ans` is now equal to the first element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the first element of the updated list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`.
Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the first element of the updated list `arr`, `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to `t`**
