Example Answer: 
The code reads input from `sys.stdin.readline()`, splits it, converts each element to an integer, and creates a list `arr` containing these integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i+1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i+1` are integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i+1` are integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`**
