Example Answer:
The `arr` list is sorted in reverse order. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i+1` are integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i+1` are integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values from splitting the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order**
