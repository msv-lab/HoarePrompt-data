According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`t` is an input integer, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
