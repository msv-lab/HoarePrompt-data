Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of array `arr`. Since `l` is 2, the value at index 2 of array `arr` is added to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans` are unchanged, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the value at index 2 of array `arr`**
