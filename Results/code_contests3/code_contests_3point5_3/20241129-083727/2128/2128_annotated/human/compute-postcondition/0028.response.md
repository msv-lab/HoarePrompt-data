According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k+1`. If `l` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans` are unchanged, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is 3, `ans` is incremented by the value at index 3 of array `arr`**
