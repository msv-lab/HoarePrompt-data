Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list `arr` plus the value at index `l`, `k` is adjusted to ensure `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` must be less than `n`.**
