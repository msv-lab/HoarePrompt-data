Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input and then for each iteration up to `t`, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts the list in descending order, calculates the sum of the largest element and the next `k` elements, with the constraint that `k` cannot exceed `n-1`. The function then prints the sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. **
