Example Answer:
The value of `arr[l]` is added to `ans`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is still less than or equal to `k+1`, the loop continues. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr` are unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]` again, `l` is incremented by 1 and still less than or equal to `k+1.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr` are unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]` again, `l` is incremented by 1 and still less than or equal to `k+1**
