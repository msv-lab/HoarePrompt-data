Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `ans`. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed. The variable `ans` is increased by the sum of the elements in `arr` from index 1 to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is incremented, `ans` is increased by the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `k`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is incremented, `ans` is increased by the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `k`**
