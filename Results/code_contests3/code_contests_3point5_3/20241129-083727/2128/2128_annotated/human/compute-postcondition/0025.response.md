Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after mapping input integers, `ans` is the sum of the largest element in the list `arr` and the elements at index 1 to `k`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1, `k+1` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2, `l` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `ans` is incremented by the value at index 1 of the list `arr`**
