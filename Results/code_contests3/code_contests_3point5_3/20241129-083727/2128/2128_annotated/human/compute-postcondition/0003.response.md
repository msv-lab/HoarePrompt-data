Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the input from standard input and splitting it by space. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are input integers obtained by mapping the input from standard input and splitting it by space, `arr` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are input integers obtained by mapping the input from standard input and splitting it by space, `arr` is a list of integers**
