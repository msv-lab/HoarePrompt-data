According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans` are unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still be less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans`, `l` are unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` should be incremented by 1 and still less than or equal to `k`**
