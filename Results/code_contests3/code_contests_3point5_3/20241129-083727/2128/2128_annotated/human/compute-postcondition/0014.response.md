Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list `arr` plus the value at index `l+1`, `k+1` is adjusted to ensure `k+1` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k+1` must be less than `n`, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr**.
