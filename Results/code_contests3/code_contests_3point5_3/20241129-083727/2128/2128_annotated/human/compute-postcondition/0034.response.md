Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans` are unchanged, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is `k+1`, `ans` is the sum of the largest element in the list `arr` and all elements from index 1 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `n, k` are assigned the values from mapping the input integers from the standard input stream.**
