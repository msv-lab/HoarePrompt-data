Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is already sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will be the largest element in the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are input integers obtained by mapping the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list `arr`.**
