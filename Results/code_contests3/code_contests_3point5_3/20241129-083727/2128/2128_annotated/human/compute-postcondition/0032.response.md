According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `ans` are unchanged, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is `k+1`, `ans` is the sum of the largest element in the list `arr` and all elements from index 1 to `n-1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
