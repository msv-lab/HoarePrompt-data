Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels. It simply sums up the maximum amount of water and k next largest amounts, which is not the correct approach. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
3 4 5 6
```
The expected output should be 6 (Pour water from barrel 4 to barrel 1 and then from barrel 4 to barrel 2), but the program will output 15 (sum of all barrels). 

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
