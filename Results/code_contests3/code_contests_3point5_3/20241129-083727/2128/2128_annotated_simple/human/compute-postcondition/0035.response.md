Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. Since `arr` is already sorted in descending order, the order remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n - 1.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n - 1**
