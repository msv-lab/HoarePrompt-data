Example Answer:
The code snippet reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is not directly affected but it might change if the elements in `arr` are different. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list**
