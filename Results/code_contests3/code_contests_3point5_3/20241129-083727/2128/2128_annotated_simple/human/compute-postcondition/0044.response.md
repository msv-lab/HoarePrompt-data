Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the first `l+1` elements in the list `arr`, `k` is equal to the value of `n - 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise retains its previous value, for the loop to execute `k` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `l` must be less than `k+1`, the sum of `ans` is updated by adding the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr**.
