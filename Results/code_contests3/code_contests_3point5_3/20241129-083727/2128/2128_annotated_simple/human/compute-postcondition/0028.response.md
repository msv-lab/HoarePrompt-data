According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `n` is assigned a value. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1 and be less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is updated, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]**.
