Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The initial state indicates that `k` is less than `n`, so `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list**
