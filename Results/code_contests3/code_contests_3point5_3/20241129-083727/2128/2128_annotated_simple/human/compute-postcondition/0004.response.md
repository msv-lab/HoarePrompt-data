Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument. The original order of the list is not provided, but after sorting, `arr` will be in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
