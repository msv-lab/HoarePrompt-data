Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the first element of the list `arr`, which is already sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will be the largest value in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest value in the list**
