According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Since the loop starts from 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be 1. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` values in the list**
