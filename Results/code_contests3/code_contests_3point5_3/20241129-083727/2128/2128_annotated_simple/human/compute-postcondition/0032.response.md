According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes 2. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n - 1`**
