Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated by adding the values of the elements in the list `arr` from index 1 to index `k`, where `k` is `n - 1`. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` will be the sum of the elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n - 1`. The initial states of the variables are as follows: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the sum of elements in `arr` from index 1 to `n - 1`.**
