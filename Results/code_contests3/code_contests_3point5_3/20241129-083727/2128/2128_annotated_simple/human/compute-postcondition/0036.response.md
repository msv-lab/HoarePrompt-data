Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`. The elements of `arr` are sorted in descending order and `arr` has at least `k` elements. Therefore, the value of `ans` is the first element in the list `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the first element in the list `arr`**
