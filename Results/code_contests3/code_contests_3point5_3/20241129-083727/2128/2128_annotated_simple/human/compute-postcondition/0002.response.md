Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space. The values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the input, so their specific values cannot be determined without knowing the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input**
