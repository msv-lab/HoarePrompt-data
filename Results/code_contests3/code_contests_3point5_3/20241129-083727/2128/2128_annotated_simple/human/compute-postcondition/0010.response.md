Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the largest value in the list plus the value of `arr[l]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is 1**
