According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is within the range 1 to `k` inclusive. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order with at least `k` elements, `ans` is the first element in the list `arr`, `k` is equal to the value of `n - 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise retains its previous value, for the loop to execute `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
