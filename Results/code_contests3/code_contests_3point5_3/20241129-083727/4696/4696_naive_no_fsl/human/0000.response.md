Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program calculates the permutation based on the input values of n and m, and outputs the result as required. The program uses the factorial function to calculate the index of the element to be selected from the permutation list, removes the selected element from the list, and updates the value of m accordingly. This process is repeated for each element in the permutation list. The program works correctly for all possible values of n and m within the specified constraints.
