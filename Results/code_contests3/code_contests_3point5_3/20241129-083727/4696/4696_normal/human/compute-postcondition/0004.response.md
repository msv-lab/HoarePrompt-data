Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a range starting from 1 up to `n` + 1. The value of `n` is known to be an integer. Therefore, the range of `p` would be from 1 to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`**
