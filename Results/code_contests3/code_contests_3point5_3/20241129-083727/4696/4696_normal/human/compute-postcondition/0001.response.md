Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, where `a` is obtained from splitting the input string. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer**
