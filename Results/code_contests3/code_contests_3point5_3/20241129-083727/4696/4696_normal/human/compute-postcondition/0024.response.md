The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the number of permutations of length n such that the maximum possible value of f(p) is m, where n and m are positive integers and 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn. The function returns the count of such permutations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) being m.
