Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to the remainder of `(b - 1) / 2`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of (`n - 2`), `d` is the floor division of `i` by `f`, the value at index `d` of `p` is printed, and `p` has the element at index `d` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`, `d` is the floor division of `i` by `f`.**
