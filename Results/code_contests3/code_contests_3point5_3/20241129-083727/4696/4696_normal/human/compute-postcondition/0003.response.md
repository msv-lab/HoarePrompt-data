Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was obtained from `b`, which in turn was obtained from splitting the input string. The value of `n` is an integer, and `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decremented by 1.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decremented by 1**
