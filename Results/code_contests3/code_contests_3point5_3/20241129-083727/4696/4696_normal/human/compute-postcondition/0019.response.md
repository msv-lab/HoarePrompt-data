Example Answer:
The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i // f`. The values of `i` and `f` are dependent on other calculations and are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the specific values of `i` and `f` at runtime.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `i` and `f` at runtime**
