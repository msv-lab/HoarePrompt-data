Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `factorial` is a function that calculates the factorial of a number. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated with the remainder of `(b - 1) / 2` and then modified by taking the modulo of `f`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` with elements removed, `k` is 3, `f` is the factorial of (`n - 2`), and the value at index `d` of `p` is removed, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`, `f` is the factorial of (`n - 3`).
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated with the remainder of `(b - 1) / 2` and then modified by taking the modulo of `f`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` with elements removed, `k` is 3, `f` is the factorial of (`n - 3`), and the value at index `d` of `p` is removed, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`**
