Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to the remainder of `(b - 1) / 2` after all iterations, `p` is an empty list, `k` has the final value of `n`, `f` is the factorial of (`n - n`), and the value at index `d` of `p` is removed at each iteration.**
