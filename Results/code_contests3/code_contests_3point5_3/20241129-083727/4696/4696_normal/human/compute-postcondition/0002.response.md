Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value obtained from the string `b`, where `b` is a part of the input string. The initial state has `a` and `b` assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, and `n` is an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b`**
