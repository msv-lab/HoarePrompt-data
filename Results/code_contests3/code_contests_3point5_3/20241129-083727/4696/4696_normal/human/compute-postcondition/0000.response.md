Example Answer:
The variables a and b are assigned the values returned by splitting the input string by whitespace. Since the initial state does not provide any context about the values of a and b, the output state will simply state that a and b are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string.
Output State: **a and b are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string**
