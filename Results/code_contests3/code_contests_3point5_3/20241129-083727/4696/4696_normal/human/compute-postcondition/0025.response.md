Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input for two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the number of permutations of length `n` such that the maximum possible value of f(p) is `m`. The function removes elements from a list `p` based on calculations in a loop. However, the code does not return any value, so it lacks the functionality to provide the count of such permutations as mentioned in the annotations. The missing functionality is to return the count of permutations meeting the specified criteria.**
