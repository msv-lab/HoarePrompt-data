#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).**
def func():
    a, b = raw_input().split()
    n = int(a)
    i = int(b)
    i = i - 1
    p = range(1, n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        f = factorial(n - k)
        
        d = i // f
        
        print(p[d]),
        
        p.remove(p[d])
        
        i = i % f
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are assigned values obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to the remainder of `(b - 1) / 2` after all iterations, `p` is an empty list, `k` has the final value of `n`, `f` is the factorial of (`n - n`), and the value at index `d` of `p` is removed at each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input for two positive integers `n` and `m`. It then calculates the number of permutations of length `n` such that the maximum possible value of f(p) is `m`. The function removes elements from a list `p` based on calculations in a loop. However, the code does not return any value, so it lacks the functionality to provide the count of such permutations as mentioned in the annotations. The missing functionality is to return the count of permutations meeting the specified criteria.
