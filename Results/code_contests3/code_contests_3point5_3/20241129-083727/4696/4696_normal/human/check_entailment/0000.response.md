Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not exactly follow the problem description. The code is supposed to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). However, after inspecting the code, it is missing the functionality to return the count of permutations meeting the specified criteria. The code only outputs the permutation itself, not the count.
- The output hints also agree with the code and point out that the missing functionality is to return the count of such permutations as mentioned in the annotations. This discrepancy confirms that the code does not fully adhere to the problem description.

Therefore, the code is not correct according to the problem description.
