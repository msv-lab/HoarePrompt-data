Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It calculates the factorial of (n-k) and uses it to determine the index of the next element to be added to the permutation. The program then removes this element from the list of available numbers and continues until all elements have been added to the permutation. The logic seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
