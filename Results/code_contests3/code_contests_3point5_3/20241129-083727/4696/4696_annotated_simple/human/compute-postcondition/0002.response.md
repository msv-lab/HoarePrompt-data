Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `b` after converting it to an integer. The value of `b` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer after converting `b` to an integer.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer after converting `b` to an integer**
