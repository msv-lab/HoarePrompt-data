Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1 with the value at index `d` removed, `k` is 3, `f` is the result of the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, the value at index `d` of `p` is printed after removing it for the next iteration, `f` is the result of the factorial of `n - k`.**
