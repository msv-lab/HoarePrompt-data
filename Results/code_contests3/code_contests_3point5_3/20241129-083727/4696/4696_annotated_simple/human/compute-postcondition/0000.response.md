Example Answer:
The code snippet `a, b = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user and splits it based on whitespace, assigning the first input to variable `a` and the second input to variable `b`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `a` and `b`, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned user inputs after splitting based on whitespace.**
