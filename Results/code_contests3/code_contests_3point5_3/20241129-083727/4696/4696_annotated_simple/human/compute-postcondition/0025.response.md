Functionality: ** The function takes two inputs, n and m, where n is the length of permutations and m is a positive integer less than or equal to the total number of permutations of length n. It then calculates and prints the m-th permutation based on the factorial calculations and removes elements from the permutation list accordingly. Finally, it prints the result. **

This summary assumes that the function correctly performs the calculations and prints the m-th permutation as described in the code. It covers the general functionality of the function based on the actual code provided.
