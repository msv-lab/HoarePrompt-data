Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`. The previous value of `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, and the previous value of `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1 with the value at index `d` removed, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, `f` is the result of the factorial of `n - k` where `k` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1 with the value at index `d` removed, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`, `f` is the result of the factorial of `n - k` where `k` is 2**
