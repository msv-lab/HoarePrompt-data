Example Answer: 
The value at index `d` in list `p` is removed. The value of `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - k`, where `n - k` is `n - 1`. Since `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. The Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `b`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1 with the value at index `d` removed, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `b`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1 with the value at index `d` removed, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by the factorial of `n - 1`**
