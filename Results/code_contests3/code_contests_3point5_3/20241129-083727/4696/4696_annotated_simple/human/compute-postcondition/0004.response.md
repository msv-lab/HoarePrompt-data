Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n` + 1, where `n` is the integer value of `a`. The value of `a` is unknown, but the value of `n` is `a`. Therefore, the range will be from 1 to `a` + 1. The value of `i` is `b - 1`, but the value of `b` is unknown. 
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to `a` + 1**
