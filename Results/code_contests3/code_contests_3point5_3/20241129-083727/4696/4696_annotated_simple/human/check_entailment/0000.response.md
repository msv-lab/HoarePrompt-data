Correctness: **True**

The program takes two integers as input, `n` and `m`, representing the length of the permutation and the lexicographically m-th permutation to find. It then generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) by iteratively calculating the factorial of `n - k` where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. It correctly calculates the index `d` of the element to be added to the permutation based on the value of `i` and then removes that element from the list of available numbers to form the permutation.

The program follows the problem description as it generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) for any given input values of `n` and `m`.
