Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers `n` and `m` as input, calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p), and outputs the required permutation. The program follows the logic described in the problem description by calculating permutations based on the factorial of `n - k` for each `k` from 1 to `n`. The program prints the permutations and removes elements from the list accordingly, resulting in the correct output. Overall, the program does exactly what the problem description asks for in all potential cases.
