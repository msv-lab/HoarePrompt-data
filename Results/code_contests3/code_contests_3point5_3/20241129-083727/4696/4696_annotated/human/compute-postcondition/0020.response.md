Example Answer:
Since the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, trying to access `p[d]` will raise a NameError. However, the value of `k` is defined as 2. Therefore, the code will not execute successfully due to the NameError.
Output State: Error: NameError: name 'i' is not defined, `k` is 2
