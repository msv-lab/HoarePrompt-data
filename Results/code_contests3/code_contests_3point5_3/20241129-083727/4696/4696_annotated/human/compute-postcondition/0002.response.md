Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. The value of `b` is obtained from splitting the input, but the specific value is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
