Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i // f`. The values of `i` and `f` are dependent on other variables and are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will be dependent on the initial values of `i` and `f`.
Output State: **Dependent on initial values of `i` and `f`**
