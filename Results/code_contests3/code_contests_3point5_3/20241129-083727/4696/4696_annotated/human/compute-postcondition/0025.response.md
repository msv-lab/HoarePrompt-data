Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `i` from the input, where `n` represents the length of permutations and `i` is a value to compute permutations. It then calculates permutations based on the factorial of `n - k`, where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. The function prints the permutations and removes elements from the list accordingly. The function does not have a specified return value.**
