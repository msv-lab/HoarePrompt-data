Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is `n + 1`, `f` is the factorial of `n - (k+1)`, `d` is the result of `i // f`, and the element at index `d` of list `p` is removed for the loop to execute another time, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
