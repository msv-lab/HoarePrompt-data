According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. Since the error indicates that 'p' is not defined, we will focus on `k` and `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, there was an error because 'p' was not defined. This means that the loop did not execute at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop index `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop started at 1 and incremented by 1 each time, the next value for `k` should be 2. 

State: **Error: NameError: name 'p' is not defined, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 2**
