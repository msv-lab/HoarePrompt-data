Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value obtained from string `a`. The variables `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input**
