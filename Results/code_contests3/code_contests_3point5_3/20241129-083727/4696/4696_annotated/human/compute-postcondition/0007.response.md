Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `i` by `f`. The value of `i` is the integer value of `b` decremented by 1, and the value of `f` is the factorial of `n - k`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are strings obtained from splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`**
