Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two input strings `s` and `t`, both of the same length, and checks if there exists a rotation of string `t` that matches string `s`. It then prints 'Yes' if such a rotation exists, and 'No' otherwise. The program uses list comprehension to generate all the rotations of string `t`, checks if any of them match string `s`, and prints the appropriate output. This approach covers all possible rotations and correctly determines if `s` equals `t` after rotation.
