You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given string S and T consisting of lowercase English letters.

Determine if S equals T after rotation.

That is, determine if S equals T after the following operation is performed some number of times:

Operation: Let S = S_1 S_2 ... S_{|S|}. Change S to S_{|S|} S_1 S_2 ... S_{|S|-1}.

Here, |X| denotes the length of the string X.

Constraints

* 2 \leq |S| \leq 100
* |S| = |T|
* S and T consist of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


S
T


Output

If S equals T after rotation, print `Yes`; if it does not, print `No`.

Examples

Input

kyoto
tokyo


Output

Yes


Input

abc
arc


Output

No


Input

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab


Output

Yes
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of string X.**
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    t = raw_input()
    print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two input strings S and T, both consisting of lowercase English letters and having the same length. It then checks if there exists a rotation of string T that matches string S, and prints 'Yes' if such a rotation exists, otherwise 'No'.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
