`t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `t` is an input string.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `t` is an input string**
