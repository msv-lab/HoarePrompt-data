Example Answer: 
The code checks if there exists a rotation of string `t` that is equal to string `s`. The output will be 'Yes' if such a rotation exists, otherwise 'No'. Therefore, the Output State is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison between the rotated versions of `t` and string `s`.
Output State: **Either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison between the rotated versions of `t` and string `s'**
