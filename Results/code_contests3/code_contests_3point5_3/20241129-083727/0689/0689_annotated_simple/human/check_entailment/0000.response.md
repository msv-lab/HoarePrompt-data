Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two strings as input, S and T, and checks if T can be obtained by rotating S. It does this by checking if any rotation of T matches S. If a matching rotation is found, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The program uses list comprehension to generate all possible rotations of T and then checks if any of them match S. This approach covers all possible cases and correctly determines if S equals T after rotation.
