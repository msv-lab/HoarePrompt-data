Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two strings `s` and `t` of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, where the lengths of `s` and `t` are equal. It then checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` and prints 'Yes' if it is possible, otherwise 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
