Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes a raw input as a string. The variables `S` and `T` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|.
Output State: **S and T are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|**
