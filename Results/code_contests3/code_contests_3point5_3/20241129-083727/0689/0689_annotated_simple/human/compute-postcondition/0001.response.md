Example Answer:
Variable `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a raw input. The values of `S` and `T` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|**
