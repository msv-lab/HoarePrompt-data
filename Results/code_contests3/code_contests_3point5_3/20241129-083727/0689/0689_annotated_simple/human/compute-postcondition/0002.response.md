Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t` any number of times. If such rotation exists, it prints "Yes", otherwise "No". The output is dependent on the relationship between strings `s` and `t`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with length between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|**
