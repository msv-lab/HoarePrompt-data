Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if any rotation of string `t` matches string `s`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `S` and `T` are not changed by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`S` and `T` remain unchanged**
