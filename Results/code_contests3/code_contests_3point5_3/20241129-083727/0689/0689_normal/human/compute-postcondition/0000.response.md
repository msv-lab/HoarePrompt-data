Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user as a string. The length of `s` is between 2 and 100, inclusive, as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S and T is between 2 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S and T is between 2 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user**
