Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S and T is between 2 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and the length of S and T is between 2 and 100, inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user**
