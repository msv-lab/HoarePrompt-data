Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program reads two strings `s` and `t` from the user input. It then checks if any rotation of string `t` matches string `s`. If a rotation of `t` matches `s`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The code accurately implements the problem description by comparing all possible rotations of string `t` with string `s`. Since the code covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, it is correct.
