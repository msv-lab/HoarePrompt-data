Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if the input string `w` is beautiful based on the problem description. It creates a dictionary `memo` to store the frequency of each character in the string `w`, and then checks if each character occurs an even number of times. If any character occurs an odd number of times, it sets `result` to False and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is True and "No" if `result` is False.

The program always follows the problem description as it correctly identifies whether each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in the input string `w`.
