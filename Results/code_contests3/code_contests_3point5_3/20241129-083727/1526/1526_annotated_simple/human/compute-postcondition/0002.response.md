According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string with at least 1 character and `c` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in string `s`**
