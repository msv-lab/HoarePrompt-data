Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `w`, `s`, and `memo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as keys and their respective frequencies as values, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as keys and their respective frequencies as values, `result` is True**
