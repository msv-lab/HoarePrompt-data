According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and its value set to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should now be the next character in string `s` after the last iteration. The value of `memo[c]` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and its value set to 1, where `c` is the next character in string `s` after the last iteration**
