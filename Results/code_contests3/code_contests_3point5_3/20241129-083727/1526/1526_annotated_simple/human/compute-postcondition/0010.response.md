Example Answer: 
The value of `c` is incremented by 1 in the `memo` dictionary. If `c` is the next character in string `s` after the last iteration, then the value of `c` in `memo` is 1, otherwise it is 0. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and its value set to 1 if `c` is the next character in string `s` after the last iteration, otherwise the value of `c` in `memo` is set to 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and its value set to 1 if `c` is the next character in string `s` after the last iteration, otherwise the value of `c` in `memo` is set to 0**
