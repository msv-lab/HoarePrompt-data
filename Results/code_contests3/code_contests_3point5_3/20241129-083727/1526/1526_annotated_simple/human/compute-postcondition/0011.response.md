According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left to iterate over, and `memo` has been updated based on the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` after the last iteration should be considered, and the corresponding value in `memo` should be updated accordingly.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and its value set to 1 if `c` is the next character in string `s` after the last iteration, otherwise the value of `c` in `memo` is set to 0**
