According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the memo dictionary. If the memo dictionary is not empty and has at least one value, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the memo dictionary is not empty and has at least one value. To achieve this, we need to set `w` to be a non-empty string, `s` should be a non-empty string, `memo` should have at least one key-value pair, and `result` should remain True.
State: **`w` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string input, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time memo is not empty and has at least one value**
