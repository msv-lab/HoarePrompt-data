Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since the input function `raw_input()` is used to accept a string input from the user, the value of `s` will be the string input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string input**
