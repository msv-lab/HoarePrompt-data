Example Answer:
The value of `c` is used to update the `memo` dictionary, where `c` is a character in the string `s`. Since `memo` is updated based on the characters seen in `s`, the value of `c` impacts the dictionary. After execution, the value of `c` is assigned 0 in the `memo` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least 1 character left to iterate over, `memo` dictionary is updated based on the characters seen so far in `s`**
