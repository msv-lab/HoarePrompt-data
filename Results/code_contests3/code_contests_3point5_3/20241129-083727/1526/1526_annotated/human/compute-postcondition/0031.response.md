Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, otherwise 'No'. The value of `result` depends on whether any character in input string `s` has an odd count in the `memo` dictionary. If there is at least one character with an odd count, `result` is False, otherwise it is True. The initial state provides that `w` is a string, `s` is the input string, and `memo` is a dictionary where the count of characters in `s` is stored. Based on this, the output state can be determined.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`, and the code prints 'Yes' if all characters have even counts in `memo`, otherwise it prints 'No'.**
