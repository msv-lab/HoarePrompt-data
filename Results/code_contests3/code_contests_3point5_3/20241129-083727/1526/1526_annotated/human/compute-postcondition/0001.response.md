Example Answer:
The dictionary `memo` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The strings `w` and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
