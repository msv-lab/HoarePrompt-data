Example Answer: 
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`, for the loop to execute another time, `memo` must have at least one more value, `result` is False.
