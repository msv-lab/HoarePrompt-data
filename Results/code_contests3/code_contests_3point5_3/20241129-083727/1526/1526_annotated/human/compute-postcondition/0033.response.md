Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an input string `s`, creates a dictionary `memo` where each character in `s` is a key storing the count of occurrences, checks if any character count is odd, and prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, otherwise 'No'. The function operates on a string variable `w` consisting of lowercase letters but does not explicitly return any value. **
