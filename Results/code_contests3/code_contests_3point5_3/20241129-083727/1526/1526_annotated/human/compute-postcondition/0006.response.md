Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, it is assigned the value 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if `c` was not in `memo`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if `c` was not in `memo**`.
