According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters does not directly affect the loop execution. The `memo` being an empty dictionary also does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character, and `c` will be the first character in `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in `s`**
