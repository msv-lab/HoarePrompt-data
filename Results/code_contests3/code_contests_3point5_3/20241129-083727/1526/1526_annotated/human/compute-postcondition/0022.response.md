According to the code, the loop executes based on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there is at least one value in the `memo`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there should still be at least one value in the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`, for the loop to execute another time, `memo` must have at least one value**
