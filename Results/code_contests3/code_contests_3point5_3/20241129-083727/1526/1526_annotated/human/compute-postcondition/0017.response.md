According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the memo dictionary. If the memo dictionary has at least one value, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, it is necessary that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, and `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`. 
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`, for the loop to execute the first time memo has at least one value**
