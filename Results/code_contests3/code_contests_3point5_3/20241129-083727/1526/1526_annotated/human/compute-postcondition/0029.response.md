Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character `c` in `s` is a key, and the value is the count of how many times `c` appears in `s`. For the loop to execute another time, `memo` must have at least one more value. If x % 2 > 0, then `result` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
