According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left to iterate over, and `memo` has been updated based on the characters seen so far in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be at least one character left in the input string `s` to iterate over.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least 1 character left to iterate over, `memo` dictionary is updated based on the characters seen so far in `s`**
