According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If there are more characters left in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, and `memo` is a dictionary with some values incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the input string `s` must be taken, and if `c` is not already in `memo`, it should be initialized to 1. 
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if `c` was not in `memo` for the loop to execute another time**
