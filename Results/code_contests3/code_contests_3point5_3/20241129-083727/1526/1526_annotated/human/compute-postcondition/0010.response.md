Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not in `memo` before, then `memo[c]` is initialized to 1. If `c` was already in `memo`, then its value is incremented by 1. The states of `w` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if `c` was not in `memo`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if `c` was not in `memo`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is initialized to 0**
