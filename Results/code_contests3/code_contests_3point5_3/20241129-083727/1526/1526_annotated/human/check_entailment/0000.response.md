Correctness: **True**

The program reads an input string `s`, creates a dictionary `memo` where each character in `s` is a key storing the count of occurrences, checks if any character count is odd, and prints 'Yes' if all character counts are even, otherwise 'No'. This matches the requirements of the problem description, which asks to determine if the string is beautiful based on each lowercase letter occurring an even number of times. The program correctly identifies whether the input string is beautiful or not based on the defined condition.
