Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute another time `memo` is not empty and `x` is the next value in `memo.values()`. If x % 2 > 0, then `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
