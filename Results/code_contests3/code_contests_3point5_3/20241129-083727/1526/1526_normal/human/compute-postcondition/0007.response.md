According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the iteration variable `c`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must still have characters left, and the next character in `s` will be the next value for `c`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 1.**
