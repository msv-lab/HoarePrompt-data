Example Answer:
The dictionary `memo` is initialized as an empty dictionary. As `memo` is the only affected variable, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
