According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 2 if `c` is in `memo`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then its value becomes 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must still be characters left in `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 2 if `c` is in `memo`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then its value becomes 1**
