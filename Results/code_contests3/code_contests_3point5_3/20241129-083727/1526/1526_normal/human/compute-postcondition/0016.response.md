Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `w`, `s`, and `memo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, `result` is True**
