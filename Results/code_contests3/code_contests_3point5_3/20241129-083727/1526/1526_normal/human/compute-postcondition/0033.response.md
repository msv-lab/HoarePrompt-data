Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a user-input string `s`, creates a dictionary `memo` to store the frequency of each unique character in `s`, and then checks if there is an odd frequency character in `memo`. If there is at least one character with an odd frequency, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function operates on the string `w`, consisting of lowercase letters, but it does not explicitly return any value.**
