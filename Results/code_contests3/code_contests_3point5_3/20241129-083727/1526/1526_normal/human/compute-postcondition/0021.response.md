Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `memo` is not empty and `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`. If the first value in `memo.values()` is an odd number, then `result` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
