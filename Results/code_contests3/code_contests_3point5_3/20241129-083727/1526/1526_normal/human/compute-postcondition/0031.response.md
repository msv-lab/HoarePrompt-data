Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, and 'No' if `result` is False. The value of `result` is determined by whether there exists at least one character with an odd frequency in the dictionary `memo.values()`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, and `result` is either True or False based on the condition mentioned above.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, and `result` is either True or False**
