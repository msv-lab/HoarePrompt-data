Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is reassigned to 0. The value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, but `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 1. After execution, the value of `memo[c]` becomes 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo` is a dictionary containing key `c` with value 0**
