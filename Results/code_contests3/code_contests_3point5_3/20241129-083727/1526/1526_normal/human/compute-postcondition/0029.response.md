Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character `c` in `s` as a key with its corresponding frequency as the value, `result` is False. For the loop to execute another time, `memo` is not empty and the next value in `memo.values()` has an odd frequency. If x % 2 is greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
