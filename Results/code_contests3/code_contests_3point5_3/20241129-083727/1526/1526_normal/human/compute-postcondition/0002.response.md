According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` having at least 1 character. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters and `memo` being an empty dictionary do not directly impact the loop execution. However, to ensure the loop executes, `s` must have at least 1 character. 
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a user-input string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
