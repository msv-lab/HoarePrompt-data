Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that reads a user-input string `s`, creates a dictionary `memo` to store the frequency of each unique character in `s`, and then checks if there is an odd frequency character in `memo`. If there is at least one character with an odd frequency, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. 

The function correctly follows the problem description as it checks if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in the input string `w`. It then prints 'Yes' if the condition is satisfied and 'No' otherwise. The code handles all potential cases as it iterates through the string and keeps track of the frequency of each character, ensuring that the final decision is based on whether all characters have even frequencies. 

Since the code aligns with the problem description and output requirements, and there are no edge cases identified where the code fails to produce the correct output, the correctness of the code is deemed to be True.
