Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string, counts the frequency of each character, and then checks if each character occurs an even number of times. If any character occurs an odd number of times, it sets the result to False and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True, indicating that the string is beautiful, and 'No' otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the input string is beautiful as per the problem description.
