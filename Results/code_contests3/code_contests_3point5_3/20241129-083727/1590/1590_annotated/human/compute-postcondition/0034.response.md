Functionality: **The function `func` reads input data about passengers and their arrival times on different floors, sorts the passengers based on their floor number, calculates the total time passed considering the time each passenger arrives and departs, and then prints the total time passed. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input.**
