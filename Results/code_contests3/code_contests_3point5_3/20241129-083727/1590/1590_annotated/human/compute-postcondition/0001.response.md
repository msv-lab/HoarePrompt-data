Example Answer:
Since the list `p` is initialized as an empty list, there are no changes to any existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n and s are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000. Each fi and ti (floor and time of arrival) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000.
Output State: **n and s are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000. Each fi and ti (floor and time of arrival) are positive integers such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000**
