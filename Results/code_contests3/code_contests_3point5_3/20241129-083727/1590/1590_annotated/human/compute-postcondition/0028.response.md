Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, a tuple (0, 0) has been appended to `p`, `i` is 2, `time_passed` is updated based on the mentioned calculation, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `p`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, the program continues with the updated values. `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `p`.**
