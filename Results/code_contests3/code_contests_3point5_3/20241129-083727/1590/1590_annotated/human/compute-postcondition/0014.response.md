Example Answer:
The variable `time_passed` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected by this initialization, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, a tuple (0, 0) has been appended to `p`**
