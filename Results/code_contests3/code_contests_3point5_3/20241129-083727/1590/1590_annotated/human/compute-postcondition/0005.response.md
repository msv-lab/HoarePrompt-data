According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
