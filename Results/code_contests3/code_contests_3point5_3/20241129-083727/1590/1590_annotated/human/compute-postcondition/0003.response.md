Example Answer: 
`fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute; `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute; `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them**
