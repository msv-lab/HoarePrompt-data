Example Answer:
The tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` has been increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` has been increased by 1**
