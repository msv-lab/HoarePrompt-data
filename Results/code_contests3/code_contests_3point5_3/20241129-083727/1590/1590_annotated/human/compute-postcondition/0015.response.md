According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `n` inclusive. The loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, a tuple (0, 0) has been appended to `p` which indicates that the list `p` has at least 1 element. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should start at 0, and `n` should remain a positive integer.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, a tuple (0, 0) has been appended to `p`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
