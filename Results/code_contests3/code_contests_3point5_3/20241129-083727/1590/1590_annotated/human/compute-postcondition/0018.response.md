Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, a tuple (0, 0) has been appended to `p`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `p`. Moreover, the `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`***
