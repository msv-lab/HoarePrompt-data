Example Answer:
`p` is appended with the tuple `(fi, ti)`, where `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them. The loop will execute for a positive integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple**
