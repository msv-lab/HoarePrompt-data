According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute**
