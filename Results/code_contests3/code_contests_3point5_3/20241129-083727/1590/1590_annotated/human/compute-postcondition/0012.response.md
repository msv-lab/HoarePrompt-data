Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple. No new variables are introduced or affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` have their respective values, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple**
