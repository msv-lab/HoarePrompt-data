Example Answer:
The tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are already assigned from the input. `i` has been increased by 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
