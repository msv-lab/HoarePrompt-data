According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `fi` and `ti` have assigned values, `p` contains the appended tuple, and `i` has been increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting them, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` has been increased by 2, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
