Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the list of passengers `p`.
- It then sorts the list of passengers based on the floor number in descending order.
- The program simulates the movement of the elevator according to the given conditions and calculates the total time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0.
- It handles the case when the elevator needs to wait for a passenger to arrive before moving.
- The program iterates through all passengers and correctly calculates the total time needed.
- The final output is the minimum amount of time in seconds needed to bring all passengers to floor 0.
- The example cases provided in the problem description are also tested and produce the expected output.
