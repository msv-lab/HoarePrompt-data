Example Answer:
A new tuple (fi, ti) is appended to the list p. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains the updated list of tuples (fi, ti), `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains the updated list of tuples (fi, ti), `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
