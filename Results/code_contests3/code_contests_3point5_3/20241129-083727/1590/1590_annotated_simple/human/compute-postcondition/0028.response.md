Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`. Therefore, the value of `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, and `time_passed` has been incremented by `s - p[i][0]` for the loop to execute a second time**
