Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the integer values extracted from the input using `map` and `split` functions. The values of `fi` and `ti` are now updated based on the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
