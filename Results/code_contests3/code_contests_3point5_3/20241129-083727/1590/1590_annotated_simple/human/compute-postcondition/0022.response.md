Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`. The value of `time_passed` is incremented by the difference between `s` and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `time_passed` is less than `p[i+1][1]` for the loop to execute a second time, `time_passed` has been incremented by `s - p[i][0]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `time_passed` is less than `p[i+1][1]` for the loop to execute a second time, `time_passed` has been incremented by `s - p[i][0]`**
