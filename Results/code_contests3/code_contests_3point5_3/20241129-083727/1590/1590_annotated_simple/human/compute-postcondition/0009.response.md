Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values returned by the `map(int, raw_input().split())` function, which converts the input values to integers. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
