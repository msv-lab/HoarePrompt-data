Example Answer:
Since `p` is assigned an empty list `[]`, the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers within the specified ranges, `p` is an empty list**
