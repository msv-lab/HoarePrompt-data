Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The values of `fi` and `ti` will depend on the input provided. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting it.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after splitting it**
