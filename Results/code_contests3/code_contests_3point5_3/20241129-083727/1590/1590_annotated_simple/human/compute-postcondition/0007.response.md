Example Answer:
A new tuple (fi, ti) is appended to the list `p`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
