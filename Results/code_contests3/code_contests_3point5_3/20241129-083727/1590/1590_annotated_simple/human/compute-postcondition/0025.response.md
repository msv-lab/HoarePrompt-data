Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `time_passed` is less than `p[i+1][1]` for the loop to execute a second time, `time_passed` has been incremented by `s - p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then the state remains unchanged.***
