Example Answer:
A tuple with elements (0, 0) is appended to the list `p`. Since `p` is already sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, after appending the new tuple, the list `p` will still be sorted in descending order. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple**
