According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer within the specified range, `p` contains a tuple of values (fi, ti), `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
