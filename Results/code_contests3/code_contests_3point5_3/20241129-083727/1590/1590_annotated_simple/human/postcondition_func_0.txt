The function `func` reads input details about the arrival time and floor of passengers in a building. It sorts the passengers based on their arrival time, calculates the total time passed based on the floor changes, and handles scenarios where time spent on a floor exceeds the passenger's specified time. The function then prints the total time passed. The function does not return any value. It processes input details for further analysis or actions.
