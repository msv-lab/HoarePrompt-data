Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is created and added to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input after splitting. The list `p` now contains this new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple**
