Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned after splitting the input, so the tuple `(fi, ti)` is added to the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input**
