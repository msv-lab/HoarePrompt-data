Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated to the difference between the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `p` and the current value of `time_passed`. The value of `i` is 2, so we are looking at the tuple at index 2 of `p`. Since `p` is sorted in descending order, we can assume that the second element of the tuple at index 2 is greater than `time_passed`. Therefore, the new value of `time_passed` will be the difference between that value and the previous value of `time_passed`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is updated to a new positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` remains the same with tuples of (fi, ti) values sorted in descending order, `time_passed` is updated to a new value, `i` is incremented to 2**
