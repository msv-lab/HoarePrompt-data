Example Answer:
`time_passed` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains tuples of (fi, ti) values for each iteration of the loop sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuple, a new tuple (0, 0) is appended to `p`; `time_passed` is 0.
