Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values by mapping integers from raw input. The values of `n` and `s` are within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000.**
