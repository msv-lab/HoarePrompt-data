According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input**
