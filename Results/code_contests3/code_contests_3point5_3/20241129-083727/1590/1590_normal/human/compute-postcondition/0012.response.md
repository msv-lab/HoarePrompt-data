Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The order of the tuples in `p` is rearranged accordingly. The values of `n`, `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains tuples of (fi, ti) values for each iteration of the loop sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuple.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains tuples of (fi, ti) values for each iteration of the loop sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuple**
