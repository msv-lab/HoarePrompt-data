Postcondition: ***After executing the code, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` continues to contain tuples of (fi, ti) values for each iteration of the loop sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuple with (0, 0) at the beginning, `time_passed` is updated based on the execution of the code, and `i` remains 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`.***
