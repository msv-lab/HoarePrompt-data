Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The variables `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input. The initial state does not specify the contents of `p`, `fi`, and `ti`, so the output state after execution is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the newly appended tuple, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values after splitting the input**
