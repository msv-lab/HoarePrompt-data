Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not handle the operation of subtracting a digit from the number to get a new magic number. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of operations based on the assumption that the only operation is dividing by 10 and checking if the last digit is zero, which is not the case in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
