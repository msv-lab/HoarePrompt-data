Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description. The code prompts the user to input a magic integer `n`, but does not handle the logic of subtracting a digit from it until the magic number equals zero. Instead, it calculates the minimum number of operations using a formula that is not in line with the problem description. Additionally, the code treats the input `n` as a string and performs division operations on it, which may lead to unexpected results. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
