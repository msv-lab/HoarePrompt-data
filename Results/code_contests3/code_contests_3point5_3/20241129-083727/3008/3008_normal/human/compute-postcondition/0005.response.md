Example Answer:
The code calculates `2 * (n / 10) + s`. If the last digit of `n` is not 0, `s` is updated to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. Then, the formula is evaluated using the updated values. The Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer entered by the user, `s` is either 0 or 1, and the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is calculated.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer entered by the user, `s` is either 0 or 1, and the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is calculated**
