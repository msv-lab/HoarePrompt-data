Functionality: ** The function `func` prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n`, checks if the last digit of `n` is not 0, updates the value of `s` accordingly, and then prints the result of the mathematical expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, there is a potential issue with the division operation, as the input `n` obtained from the user is treated as a string, not as an integer, which may lead to unexpected results. **
