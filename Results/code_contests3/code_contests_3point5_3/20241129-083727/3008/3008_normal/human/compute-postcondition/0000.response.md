Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The type of input is not specified, so `n` could be any value provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, `n` is assigned the value entered by the user.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, `n` is assigned the value entered by the user**
