The function `func` reads an input integer `n` and checks if it is divisible by 10. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it sets `s` to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. Then, it calculates 2 times `n` divided by 10 plus `s` and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly expects the user to input a non-negative integer `n`.
