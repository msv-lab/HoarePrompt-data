Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, the value entered through `input()` will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer**
