Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates 2 times the result of n divided by 10 and adds s to it. If n is not divisible by 10, s is 1, otherwise, s is 0. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, s is 1 if n is not divisible by 10. Otherwise, s remains 0 and the result of the calculation is printed.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, s is 1 if n is not divisible by 10. Otherwise, s remains 0.**
