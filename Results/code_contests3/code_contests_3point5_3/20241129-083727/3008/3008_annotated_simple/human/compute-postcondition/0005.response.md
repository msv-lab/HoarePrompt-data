Example Answer:
If n % 10 != 0, then `s` is updated to 1, otherwise `s` remains 0. The expression inside the print statement calculates 2 times the result of (n / 10) plus the value of `s`. Depending on the value of `n`, the output will vary accordingly.
Output State: **Depends on the value of `n` and whether n % 10 != 0 or not**
