Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem described in the problem description. The program does not follow the logic of subtracting a digit from the magic number until it reaches zero. Instead, it simply divides the number by 10 and multiplies it by 2, which is not the correct approach as per the problem description.

The program does not handle the process of subtracting a digit from the number and counting the number of operations correctly. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
