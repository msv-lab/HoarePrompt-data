Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` is determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, for the loop to execute another time `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` is determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, for the loop to execute another time `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`**
