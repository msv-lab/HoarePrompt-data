According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` are all 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is now 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
