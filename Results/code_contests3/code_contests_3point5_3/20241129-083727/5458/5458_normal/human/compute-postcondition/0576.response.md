According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i` are all incremented by 1. `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is either 2 or 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` becomes 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program behaves as follows: if `i` is equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` becomes 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 2. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
