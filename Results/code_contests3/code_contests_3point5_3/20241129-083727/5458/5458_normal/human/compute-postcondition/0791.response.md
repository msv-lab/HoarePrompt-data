Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is n^2 - 1, `M` remains the same, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` can be 0 or not, `j` is less than or equal to m + 1, `k` is increased by 1, and `dp` is fully updated for the next iteration of the loop.
