Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly given, but since `i` is 0, the assignment operation takes place based on this information. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
