Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N` is `n^2 - 1`, `M` is the initial value, `S` is `s + m`, `mod` is unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `dp` is fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The update operation on `dp` is performed according to the code snippet provided.**
