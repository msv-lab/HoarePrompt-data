Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the state of the program remains unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
