Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints. mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is 1. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, updated values in the dp list based on the calculations mentioned above.***
