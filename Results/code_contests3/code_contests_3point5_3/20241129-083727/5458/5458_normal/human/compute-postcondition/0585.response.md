Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are incremented by 1. `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` becomes 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions mentioned in the loop code.**
