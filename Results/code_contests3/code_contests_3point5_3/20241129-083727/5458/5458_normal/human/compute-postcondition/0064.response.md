According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is m + 1, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next value of `k` should be 3.

State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the third time k is 3**
