Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the third time k is 3, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. After executing the provided Python code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] to it.**
