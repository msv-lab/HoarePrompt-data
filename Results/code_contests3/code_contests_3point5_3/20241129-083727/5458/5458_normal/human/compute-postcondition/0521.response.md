According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` (initialized to 1), `j + 2` is less than `m - 1`, `i`, and `m` are all given. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` (initialized to 1), `j + 2` is less than `m - 1`, `i`, `m`, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`**
