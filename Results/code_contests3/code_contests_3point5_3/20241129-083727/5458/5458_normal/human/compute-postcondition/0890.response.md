Output State: **`N` is n^2, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is m + 3, `k` is between 1 and s + 1, `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is `k + 1**
