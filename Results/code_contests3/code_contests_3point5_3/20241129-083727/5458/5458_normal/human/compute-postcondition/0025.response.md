Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the code snippet, it can be inferred that `j` is incremented by 1. The dimensions of the `dp` list are increased by 1 in the second index. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 2)]. `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`.
