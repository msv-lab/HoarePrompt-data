According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0. 
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 <= M <= 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
