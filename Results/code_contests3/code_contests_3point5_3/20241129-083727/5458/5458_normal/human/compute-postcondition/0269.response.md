Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration**
