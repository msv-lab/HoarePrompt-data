Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod` remain the same positive integers with specified constraints. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
