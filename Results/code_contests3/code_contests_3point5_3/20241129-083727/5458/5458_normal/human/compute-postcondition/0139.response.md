Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After running the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
