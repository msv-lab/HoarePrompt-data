Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, N, M, S, mod, s, m, j is 2, i is 0, k is s, dp is fully updated, j >= k, for the loop to execute the last time k should be equal to s, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
