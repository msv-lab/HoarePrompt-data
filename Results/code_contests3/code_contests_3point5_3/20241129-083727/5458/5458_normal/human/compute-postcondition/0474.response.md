Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, `m` are all integers. For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 based on the conditions mentioned. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the remainder of dividing dp[i & 1][j][k - j] by mod.***
