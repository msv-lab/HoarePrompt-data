Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same. The loop will continue as long as j is greater than or equal to k. 
Output State: **At the end of the if else block, the variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as at the start of the next iteration. dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. The loop will continue to execute as long as j is greater than or equal to k.**
