According to the given code snippet, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is an integer and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 
The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are also mentioned:
- If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.
- Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: *`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i`, `m` are all integers. `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`.
