According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. Since the loop range is from 1 to s + 1, k needs to be between 1 and s inclusive for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `N` will be `n^2`, `M` will remain the same, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be incremented by 1, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s`, and `dp` will be fully updated**
