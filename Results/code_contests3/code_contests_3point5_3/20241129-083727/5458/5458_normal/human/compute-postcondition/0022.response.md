According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, the loop body is omitted. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `s + 1`. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`.**
