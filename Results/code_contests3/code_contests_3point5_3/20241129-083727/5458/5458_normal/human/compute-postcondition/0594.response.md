Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are incremented by 1. `i` is within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and other variables incremented by 1 accordingly. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` need to be checked based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k. Moreover, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j > k`, holds true. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
