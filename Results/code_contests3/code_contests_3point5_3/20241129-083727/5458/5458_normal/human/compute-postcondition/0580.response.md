Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one. In this case, since there is no loop provided, the `continue` statement does nothing and the program continues to execute. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State: All variables are incremented by 1, and the described conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are applied based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k.
Output State: **All variables are incremented by 1, and the described conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are applied based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k**.
