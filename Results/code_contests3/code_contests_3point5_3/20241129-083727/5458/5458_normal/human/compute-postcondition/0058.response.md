Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `&` is a bitwise AND operator. This means the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the second time k is 2.
