Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, for the loop to execute another time `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program continues with the existing conditions.***
