Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final output state will have `N`, `M`, `S` as positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `mod` will remain 100000. `n` will be at least 1, `m` will be greater than 0, `s` will be greater than 0. `dp` will be a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. The values in `dp` will be calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will then be updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.**
