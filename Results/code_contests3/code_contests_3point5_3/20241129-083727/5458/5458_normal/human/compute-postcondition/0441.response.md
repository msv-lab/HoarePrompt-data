Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If i == 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions described for the else part, updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` accordingly.***
