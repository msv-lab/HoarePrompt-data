According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `s` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], `j` is `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
