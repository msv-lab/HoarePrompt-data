Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k`, and `j` are incremented by 1. `i` remains within the range 1 to `s`, `k` remains within the range 1 to `s`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
