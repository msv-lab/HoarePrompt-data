Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the dp array is updated with the value 1 at index i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k. If `i == 0` but the condition on `j` and `k` is not met, then there is no change in the state of the variables. If `i != 0`, all variables remain the same, and the program continues executing from the next iteration of the loop.***
