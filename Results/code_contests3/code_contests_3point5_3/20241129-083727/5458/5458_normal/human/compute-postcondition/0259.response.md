Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations of the loop. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute another time, the next value of `k` should be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
