Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j` is 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 2, `dp` is fully updated, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`.***
