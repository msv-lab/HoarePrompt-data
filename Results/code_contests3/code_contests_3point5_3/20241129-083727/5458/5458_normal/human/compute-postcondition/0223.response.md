Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged and the loop continues to execute based on the conditions mentioned in the loop code.***
