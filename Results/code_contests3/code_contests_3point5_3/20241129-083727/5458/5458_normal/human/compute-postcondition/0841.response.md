Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: At the next iteration, `N` will be `n^2`, `M` will remain the same, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be incremented by 1, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s`, and `dp` will be fully updated. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. When the program enters the if statement, `j` will be greater than `k`.
