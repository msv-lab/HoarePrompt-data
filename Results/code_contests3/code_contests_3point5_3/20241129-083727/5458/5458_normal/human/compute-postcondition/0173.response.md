Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute again `k` is 2. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` remain unchanged, but the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition in the else part.***
