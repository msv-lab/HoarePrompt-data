Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **At the end of the if else block, the variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as at the start of the next iteration. dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.**
