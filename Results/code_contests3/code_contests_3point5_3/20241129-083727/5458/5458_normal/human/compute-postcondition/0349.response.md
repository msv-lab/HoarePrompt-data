Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, a value of 1 is assigned to an unspecified index of `dp` if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is updated based on the condition `j > k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
