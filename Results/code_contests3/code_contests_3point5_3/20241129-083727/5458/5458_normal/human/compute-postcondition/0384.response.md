According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j` is the final values based on the conditions and calculations within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`.**
