Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: At the next iteration, `N` will be `n^2`, `M` will remain the same, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s` (updated value), and `dp` will be fully updated.
