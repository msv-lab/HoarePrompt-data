Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `N` remains n^2, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is m + 2 if the condition j >= k is satisfied, and m + 3 if it is not, `k` is between 1 and s + 1, `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0 in the if part and not equal to 0 in the else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` in both parts, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is `k + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
