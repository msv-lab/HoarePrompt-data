Example Answer:
The `print` statement outputs the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. Since all variables remain unchanged at the end of the loop execution and the dynamic programming array `dp` is fully updated, the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` will be calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` after the loop execution.
Output State: **The value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` after the loop execution**
