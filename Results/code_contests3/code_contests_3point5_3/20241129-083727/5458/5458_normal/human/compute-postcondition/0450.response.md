Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, when j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], otherwise dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] added to it.***
