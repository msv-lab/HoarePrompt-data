Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of variables are not affected as the assignment is direct. Therefore, the Output State is: *N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is 1. When the program enters the if condition (i == 0), j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.
