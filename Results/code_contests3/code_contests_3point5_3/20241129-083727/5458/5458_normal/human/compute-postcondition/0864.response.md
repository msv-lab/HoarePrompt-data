According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is between 1 and `s`, inclusive. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`N` is still `n^2`, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is `s + m`, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or the total number of times the loop iterated, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is between 1 and `s`, and `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop**
