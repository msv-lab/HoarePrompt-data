According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j + 1` is equal to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` should be less than `m`.
State: **At the end of the loop, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, and `m` are all integers. For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `m - 1**.
