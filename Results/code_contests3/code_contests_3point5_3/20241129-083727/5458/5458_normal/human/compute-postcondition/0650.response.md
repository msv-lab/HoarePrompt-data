Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j` is 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 2, `dp` is fully updated, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0. If `i == 0`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`.***
