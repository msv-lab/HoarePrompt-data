Based on the loop statement and the provided information, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], All elements in `dp` will have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`.**
