Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `m` are final values; `i` is not equal to 0. The loop continues if `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
