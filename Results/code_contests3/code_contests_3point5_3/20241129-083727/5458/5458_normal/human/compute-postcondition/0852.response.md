Postcondition: ***At the next iteration, `N` will be `n^2`, `M` will remain the same, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s` (updated value), and `dp` will have `1` assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j >= k` in the if part. In the else part, the state of the program remains the same with `dp` being fully updated.***
