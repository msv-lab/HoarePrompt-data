Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, `N` is `n^2 - 1`, `M` is the initial value, `S` is `s + m`, `mod` is unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s`, and `dp` is fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
