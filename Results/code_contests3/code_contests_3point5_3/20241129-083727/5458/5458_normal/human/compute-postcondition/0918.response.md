Postcondition: ***All variables `N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k+1, dp` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` must be greater than or equal to `k` for all variables to remain unchanged after the assignment operation. If the condition `i == 0` is true, the variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged.***
