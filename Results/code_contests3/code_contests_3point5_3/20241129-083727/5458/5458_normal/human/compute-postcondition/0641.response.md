Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j` is 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 1, `dp` is fully updated, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, the program continues with the mentioned states. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
