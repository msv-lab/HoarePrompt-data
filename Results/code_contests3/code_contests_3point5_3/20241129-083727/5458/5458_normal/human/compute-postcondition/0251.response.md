Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations of the loop, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, `(i != 0)`. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
