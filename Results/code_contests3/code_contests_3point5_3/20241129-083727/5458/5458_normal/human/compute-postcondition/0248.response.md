Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations of the loop. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the if statement executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
