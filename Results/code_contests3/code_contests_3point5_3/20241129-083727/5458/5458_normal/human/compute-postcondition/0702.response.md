Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` have specific values. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` is one greater than the previous value. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values, s is greater than or equal to 1, j is incremented by 1. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values, s is greater than or equal to 1, j is incremented by 1. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k**
