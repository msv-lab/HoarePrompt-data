Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` should be at least 1 and `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. If `j > k`, then all variables are incremented by 1 and the loop can execute one more time with the mentioned conditions. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
