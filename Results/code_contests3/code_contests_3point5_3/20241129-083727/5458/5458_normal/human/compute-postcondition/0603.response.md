Output State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are incremented by 1. Conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are checked based on the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k. `i` is not equal to 2. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
