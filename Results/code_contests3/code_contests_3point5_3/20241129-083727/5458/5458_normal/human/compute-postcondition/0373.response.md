Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all equal to 1. `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is equal to 2. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
