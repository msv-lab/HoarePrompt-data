Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is s - 1. After the if else block executes, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k, otherwise dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
