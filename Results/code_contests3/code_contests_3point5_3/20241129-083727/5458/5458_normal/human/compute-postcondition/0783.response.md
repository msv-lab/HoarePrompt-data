Output State: **N will be n^2 - 1, M will remain the same, S will be s + m, mod will remain unchanged, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, i can be 0 or not, j will be less than or equal to m + 1, k is 2, dp will be fully updated. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will have the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod added to it.**
