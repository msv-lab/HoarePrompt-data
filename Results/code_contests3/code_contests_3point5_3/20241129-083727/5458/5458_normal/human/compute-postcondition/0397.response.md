Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j` are the final values based on the conditions and calculations within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 1, and `j` should be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
