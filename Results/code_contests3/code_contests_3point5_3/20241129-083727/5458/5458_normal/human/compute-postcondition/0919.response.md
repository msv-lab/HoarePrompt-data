According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k+1, dp` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k+2, dp` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block**
