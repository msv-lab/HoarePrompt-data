Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 2, `k` is 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by taking the modulo of the previous value with `mod`.***
