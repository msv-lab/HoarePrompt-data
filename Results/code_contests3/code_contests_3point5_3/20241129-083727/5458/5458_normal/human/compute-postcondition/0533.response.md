Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0, all variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
