Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, while the elements in `dp` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code.**
