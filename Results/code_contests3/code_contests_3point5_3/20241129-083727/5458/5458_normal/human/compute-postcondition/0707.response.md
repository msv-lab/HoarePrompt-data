Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If i == 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program variables remain unchanged and `j` is incremented by 1. If i == 0 and `j` is less than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated.***
