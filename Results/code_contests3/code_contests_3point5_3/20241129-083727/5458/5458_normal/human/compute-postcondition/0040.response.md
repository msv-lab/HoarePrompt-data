Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 1. The loop has executed for all iterations. The final values of `dp` after all the iterations are complete based on the conditions provided in the loop code.**
