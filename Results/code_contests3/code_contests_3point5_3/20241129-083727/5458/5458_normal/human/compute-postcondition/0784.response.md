Postcondition: ***N will be n^2 - 1, M will remain the same, S will be s + m, mod will remain unchanged, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, i can be 0 or not, j will be less than or equal to m + 1, k is 2, dp will be fully updated. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1; otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and have the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod added to it.***
