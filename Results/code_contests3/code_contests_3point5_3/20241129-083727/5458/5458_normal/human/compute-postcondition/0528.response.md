Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same, and the values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` (initialized to 1), `j + 2` is less than `m - 1`, `i`, `m`, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j` (initialized to 1), `j + 2` is less than `m - 1`, `i`, `m`, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
