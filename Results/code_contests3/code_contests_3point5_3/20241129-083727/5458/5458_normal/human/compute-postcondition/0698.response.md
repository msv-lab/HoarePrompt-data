Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1. i is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1. i is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
