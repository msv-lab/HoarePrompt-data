According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 0 and `k` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1`, which means `k` needs to be 1. Also, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 2, `k` is 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
