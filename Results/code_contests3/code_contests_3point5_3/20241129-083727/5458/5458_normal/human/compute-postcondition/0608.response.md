Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are incremented by 1. `i` remains within the range 1 to `s`, `k` remains within the range 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and other variables incremented by 1 accordingly. The condition `i` not equal to 2 holds true. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] as specified in the code snippet. If `i == 0`, the postcondition remains the same as described earlier. If `i` is not equal to 0, all variables are incremented by 1 and `i` remains within the range 2 to `s`, `k` remains within the range 2 to `s`. The conditions for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are checked based on the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 3. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
