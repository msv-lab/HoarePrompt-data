Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `N` is `n^2 - 1`, `M` is the initial value, `S` is `s + m`, `mod` is unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `dp` is fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is 0, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `i` remains unchanged and the update operation on `dp` is performed according to the code snippet provided.***
