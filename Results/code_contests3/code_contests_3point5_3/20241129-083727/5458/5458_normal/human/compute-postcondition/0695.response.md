According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. At the end of the loop execution, the variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as their initial values. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
