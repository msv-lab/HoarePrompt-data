Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i` are incremented by 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 1. After entering the if condition (i == 0) and (j >= k), the value of `i` becomes 0. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
