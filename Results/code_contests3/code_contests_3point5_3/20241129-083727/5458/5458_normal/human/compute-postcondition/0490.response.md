Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, and `m` are all integers. `s` is at least 1, `j + 1` is less than `m - 1` for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. When `j >= k` is true, the program variables retain their initial integer state with the condition that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
