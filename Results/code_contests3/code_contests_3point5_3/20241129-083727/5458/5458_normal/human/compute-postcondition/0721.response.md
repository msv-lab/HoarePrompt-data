Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values. If i == 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, j is incremented by 1. If i == 0 and j is less than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated. For the loop to execute one more time, k should be less than or equal to s-1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if the if part is executed. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod if the else part is executed**.
