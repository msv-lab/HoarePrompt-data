Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1. When `i` equals 0, the program enters this if condition***
