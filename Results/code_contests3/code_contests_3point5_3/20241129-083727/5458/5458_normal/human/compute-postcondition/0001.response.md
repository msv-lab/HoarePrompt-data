According to the code, the `while 1` loop will run indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Since it is an infinite loop, it will execute at least once without any adjustment in the states right before the loop.

State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000; mod is 100000, the loop will execute at least once without any state adjustments**
