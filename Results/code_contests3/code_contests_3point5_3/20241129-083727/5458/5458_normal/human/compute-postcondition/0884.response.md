Output State: **N is still n^2, M remains unchanged, S is s + m, mod remains the same, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, j is m + 2 in the if part and m + 3 in the else part, k is between 1 and s + 1, dp is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, i is 0 in the if part and not equal to 0 in the else part, j is greater than or equal to k in both parts, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
