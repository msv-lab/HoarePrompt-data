Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` continues without any changes to the variables.***
