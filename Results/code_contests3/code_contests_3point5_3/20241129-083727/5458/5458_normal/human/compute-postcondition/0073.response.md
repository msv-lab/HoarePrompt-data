Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1. The final values in dp will be calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for all values of k from 1 to s. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is then updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] to it.**
