Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The dimensions of `dp` are [(m + 2), (s + 1)], so the new values are calculated based on the previous values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, n is at least 2, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with updated elements, k is 2 for the loop to execute again.**
