Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since all variables are initially 1, the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is also 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp, j, k are all equal to 1 and s is greater than 0, k is equal to 2, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp, j, k are all equal to 1 and s is greater than 0, k is equal to 2, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
