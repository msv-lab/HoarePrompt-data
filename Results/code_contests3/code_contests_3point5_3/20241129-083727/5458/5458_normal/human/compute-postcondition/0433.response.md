According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are 1, and `m` is at least 1. The loop increments `k` by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**
