Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j` are the final values based on the conditions and calculations within the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is at least 1, `j` should be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `m`. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
