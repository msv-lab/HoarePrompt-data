According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`.
State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is s - 1**
