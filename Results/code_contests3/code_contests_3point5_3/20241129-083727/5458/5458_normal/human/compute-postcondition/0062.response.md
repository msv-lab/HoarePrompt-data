Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, k is 2. If j > k, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, nothing happens. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
