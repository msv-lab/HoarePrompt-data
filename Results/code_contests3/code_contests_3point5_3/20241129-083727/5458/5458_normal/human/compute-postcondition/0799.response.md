Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, the new value of `i` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `k` remain the same. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is n^2 - 1, M is the initial value, S is s + m, mod is unchanged, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, i is 1, j is m + 1, k is 1, dp is fully updated for all combinations of i, j, and k. Moreover, j is greater than or equal to k.
