Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise no change in the variables occurs. If `i` is not 0, `dp` has been updated based on the given formula if `j > k`.***
