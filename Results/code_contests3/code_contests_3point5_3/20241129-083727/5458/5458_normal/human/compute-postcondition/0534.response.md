According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`. 

For the next iteration, the value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `k + 1`. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
