Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since `i` can be 0 or not, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is increased by 1, the output state after running the code is that `dp` is fully updated for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`dp` is fully updated for the next iteration of the loop**
