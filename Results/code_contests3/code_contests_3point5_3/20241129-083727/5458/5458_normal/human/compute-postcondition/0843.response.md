Postcondition: ***At the next iteration, `N` will be `n^2`, `M` will remain the same, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be either 0 or incremented by 1, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s`, and `dp` will be fully updated. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. Additionally, when the program enters the else part, `i` will not be equal to 0 and `j` will be greater than `k`.***
