Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The values of i, j, and k are not specified, so the new values of the affected variables cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, and the program continues executing from the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, and the program continues executing from the next iteration of the loop.**
