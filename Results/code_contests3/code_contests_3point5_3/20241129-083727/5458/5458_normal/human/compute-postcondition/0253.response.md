Postcondition: ***All variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`) have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations. `k` is still less than or equal to `s + 1`, `(i != 0)`, and `j` is greater than `k`. The program execution continues to the next iteration of the loop if `j > k`.***
