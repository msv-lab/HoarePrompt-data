Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `i` is `n^2 - 1`, `j` remains the same as the initial value, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp` is fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `j` is greater than `k`.***
