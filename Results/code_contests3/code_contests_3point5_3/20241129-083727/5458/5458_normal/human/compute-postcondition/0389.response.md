Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j` are the final values based on the conditions and calculations within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and still less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, when the if condition is met (j >= k), `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.***
