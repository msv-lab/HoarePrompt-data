Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations of the loop. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
