According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. The conditions for the loop to execute the last time are that `k` should be equal to `s` and `i` is 0 and `j >= k`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `k` is `s`, `dp` is fully updated, `j >= k`, for the loop to execute the last time `k` should be equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
