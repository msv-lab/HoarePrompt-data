Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the second time k is 2. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
