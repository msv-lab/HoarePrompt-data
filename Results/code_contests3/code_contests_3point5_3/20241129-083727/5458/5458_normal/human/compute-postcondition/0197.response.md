Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code, `k` is incremented by 1. If i == 0, no changes occur except for the increment of `k`. If i != 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the provided formula, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are used as indices to access elements in the 2D list `dp`, and `mod` is used for the modulo operation. All other variables remain unchanged, and `k` is incremented by 1.***
