Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by mod. The variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop**
