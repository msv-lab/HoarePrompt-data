According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m + 1`.

State: **At the end of the code execution, `N` will be `n^2 - 1`, `M` will remain the same as the initial value, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be updated according to the loop conditions, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` can be 0 or not, `j` will be less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` will be `s + m`, and `dp` will be fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
