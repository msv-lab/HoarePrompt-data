Postcondition: ***All variables `N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp` remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, all variables remain unchanged after the assignment operation.***
