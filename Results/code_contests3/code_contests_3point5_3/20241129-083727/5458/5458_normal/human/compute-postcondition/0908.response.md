Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j+1, k, dp remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop**
