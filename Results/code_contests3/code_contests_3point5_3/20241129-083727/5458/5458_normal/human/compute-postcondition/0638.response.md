Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m` is 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 1, `dp` is fully updated, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
