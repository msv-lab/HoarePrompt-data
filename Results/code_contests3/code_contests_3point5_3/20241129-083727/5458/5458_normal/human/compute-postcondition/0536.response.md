Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j >= k`, then `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.***
