Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j` are integers all incremented by 1 before the if else block. To loop one more time, `s` should be at least 1 and `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if i is 0. If i is not 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `j` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` initially and then updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
