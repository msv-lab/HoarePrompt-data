Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If i == 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, and j > k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
