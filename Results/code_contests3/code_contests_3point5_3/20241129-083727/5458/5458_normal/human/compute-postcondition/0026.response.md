Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod` remain the same positive integers with the specified constraints. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 2)], `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 1.**
