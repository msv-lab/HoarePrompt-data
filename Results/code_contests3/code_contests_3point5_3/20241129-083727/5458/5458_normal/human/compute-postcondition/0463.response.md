Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k` is 1, `m`, and `i` have their final values determined, for the loop to execute again `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues based on the given conditions. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
