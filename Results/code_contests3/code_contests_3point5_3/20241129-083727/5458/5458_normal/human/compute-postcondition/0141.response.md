Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables in the program will be as follows:
- `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints
- `mod` is 100000
- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is greater than 0
- `s` is greater than 0
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]
- All elements in `dp` will have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code**
