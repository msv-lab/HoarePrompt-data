Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all equal to 1. `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is now equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
