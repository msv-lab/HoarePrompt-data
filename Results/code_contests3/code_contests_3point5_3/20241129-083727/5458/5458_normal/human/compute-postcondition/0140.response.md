Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. If i == 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i != 0, and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, after execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod to it.***
