Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the final values of N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, dp, k, i, and j are determined. For the loop to execute one more time, s is greater than or equal to 2, m is determined, j is less than or equal to m, and the specified conditions for dp are met. If j >= k, all the variables remain the same as the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` does not affect the values of N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, dp, k, i, and j.***
