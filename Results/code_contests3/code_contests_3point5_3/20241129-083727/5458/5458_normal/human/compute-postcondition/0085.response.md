Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where mod is 100000. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` and `k` remain the same. Since the previous values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, the output state is as follows: N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints. mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. Additionally, j is m, k is 1, i is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints. mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. Additionally, j is m, k is 1, i is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k**
