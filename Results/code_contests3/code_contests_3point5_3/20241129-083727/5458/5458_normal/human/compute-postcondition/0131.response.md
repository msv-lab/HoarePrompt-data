Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], for the loop to execute the second time `k` is s + 1. If i == 0, some element in dp has been updated to 1 if j >= k. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
