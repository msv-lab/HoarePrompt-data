According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` was incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program variables remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If i == 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program variables remain unchanged and `j` is incremented by 1. If i == 0 and `j` is less than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated. For the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s**`.
