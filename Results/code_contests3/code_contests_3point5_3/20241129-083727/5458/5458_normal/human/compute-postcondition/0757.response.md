Postcondition: ***At the end of the code execution, `N` will be `n^2 - 1`, `M` will be the same as the initial value, `S` will be `s + 2`, `mod` remains the same, `s` will be updated based on the code, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be 0, `j` will be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` will be `s + 2`, and `dp` will be fully updated according to the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
