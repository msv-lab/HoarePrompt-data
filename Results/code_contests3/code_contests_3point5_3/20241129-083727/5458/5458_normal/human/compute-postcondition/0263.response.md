Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` remain the same. For all values of `i`, `j`, and `k` that satisfy the loop conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration if `j > k`. After running the provided Python code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
