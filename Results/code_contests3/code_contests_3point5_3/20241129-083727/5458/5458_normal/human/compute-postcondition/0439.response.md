Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
