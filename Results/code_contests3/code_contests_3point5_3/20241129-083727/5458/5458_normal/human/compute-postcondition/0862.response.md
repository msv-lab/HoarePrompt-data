Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N` will still be `n^2`, `M` will remain unchanged, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain the same, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be either 0 or the total number of times the loop iterated, `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` will be between 1 and `s`, and `dp` will be fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop.**
