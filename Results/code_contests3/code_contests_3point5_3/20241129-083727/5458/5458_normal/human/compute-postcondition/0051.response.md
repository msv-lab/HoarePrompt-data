Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time k is 1, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
