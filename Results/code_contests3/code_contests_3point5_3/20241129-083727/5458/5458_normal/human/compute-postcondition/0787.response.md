Postcondition: ***`N` is n^2 - 1, `M` remains the same, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` can be 0 or not, `j` is less than or equal to m + 1, `k` is increased by 1, `dp` is fully updated for the next iteration of the loop, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k.***
