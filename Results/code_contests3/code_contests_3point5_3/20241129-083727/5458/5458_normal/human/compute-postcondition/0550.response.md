Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be within their specified ranges and conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the dynamic programming array.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the dynamic programming array**
