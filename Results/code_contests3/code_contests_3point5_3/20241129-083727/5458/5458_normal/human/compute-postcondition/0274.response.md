Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain the same. `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the else part is executed, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
