Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The values of i, j, and k are used in the calculation, but their initial values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as described.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as initial values, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated as described**
