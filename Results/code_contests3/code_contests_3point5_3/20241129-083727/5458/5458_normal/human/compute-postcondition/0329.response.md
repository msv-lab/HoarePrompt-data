Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with the given variables. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
