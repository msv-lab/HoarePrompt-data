Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 1. The loop is executed for the first time. i is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is true***
