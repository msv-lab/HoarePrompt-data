Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The modulo operation is performed with the value of mod, which is 100000. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time k is 1, i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the updated value after the addition operation and modulo calculation.
