Output State: **The final values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` will be determined based on the conditions in the loop code. The `dp` matrix will hold the calculated values based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The value printed is `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`, which is dependent on the final state of the variables after the loop iterations.**
