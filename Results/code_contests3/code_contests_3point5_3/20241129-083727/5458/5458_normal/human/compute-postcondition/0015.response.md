Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 <= M <= 2000, S is a positive integer such that 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is 0, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is 1, for the loop to execute the first time m is greater than 0, and i is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition (j > k) where k is a variable not mentioned in the precondition, the program state remains the same as before entering the if condition.***
