Postcondition: ***`N` is still `n^2`, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is `s + m`, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
