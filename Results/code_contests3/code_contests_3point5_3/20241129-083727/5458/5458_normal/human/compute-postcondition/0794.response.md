Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N` will be `n^2 - 1`, `M` will remain the same as the initial value, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` will be greater than or equal to 1, `m` will be greater than or equal to 1, `i` can be 0 or not, `j` will be less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` will be `s + m`, and `dp` will be fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If the loop does not execute, the variable values will remain the same as the initial state.**
