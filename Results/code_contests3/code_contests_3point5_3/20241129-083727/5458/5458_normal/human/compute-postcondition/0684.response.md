According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as j is greater than or equal to k. At the end of the last iteration, dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **At the end of the if else block, the variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as at the start of the next iteration. dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. The loop will continue to execute as long as j is greater than or equal to k.**
