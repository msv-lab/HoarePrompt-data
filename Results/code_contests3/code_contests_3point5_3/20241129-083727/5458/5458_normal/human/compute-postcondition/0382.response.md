Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all equal to 1. `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is equal to 2. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is not equal to 0, then all variables remain the same as before the execution of the block.***
