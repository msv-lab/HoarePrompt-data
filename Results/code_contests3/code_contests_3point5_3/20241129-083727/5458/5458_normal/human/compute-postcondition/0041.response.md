According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. So in order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and become less than `m + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is `m + 1`.**
