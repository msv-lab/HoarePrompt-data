Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, dp, k, i, and j are determined. For the loop to execute one more time, s is greater than or equal to 2, m is determined, j is less than or equal to m, and the specified conditions for dp are met. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
