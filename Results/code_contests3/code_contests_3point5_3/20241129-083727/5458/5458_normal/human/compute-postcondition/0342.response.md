Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact indices of the `dp` array that are being modified. Therefore, the output state is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`, and a value of 1 is assigned to an unspecified index of `dp`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `s`, and a value of 1 is assigned to an unspecified index of `dp`**
