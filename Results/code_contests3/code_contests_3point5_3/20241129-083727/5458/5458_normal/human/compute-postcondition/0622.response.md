Since the `while` loop condition is `while 1`, it means the loop will execute indefinitely unless there is a `break` statement within the loop body. Therefore, the loop will execute one more time without any adjustments to the states.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s` and the dynamic programming array `dp` is fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k` within the specified ranges.**
