Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k+1` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k+1` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute another time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values in the dynamic programming array.***
