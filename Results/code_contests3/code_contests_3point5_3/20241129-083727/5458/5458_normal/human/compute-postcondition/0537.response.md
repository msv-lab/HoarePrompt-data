Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and the values of `dp`, `s`, and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
