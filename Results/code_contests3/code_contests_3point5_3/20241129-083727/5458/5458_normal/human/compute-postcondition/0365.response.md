According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are equal to 1 and `s` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are all equal to 1. `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is equal to 2**
