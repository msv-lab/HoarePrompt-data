Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, `m` are all integers. For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i == 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise all variables remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, the loop continues if `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
