Output State: At the end of the execution, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i` are all incremented by 1. `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`. `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. Now, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
