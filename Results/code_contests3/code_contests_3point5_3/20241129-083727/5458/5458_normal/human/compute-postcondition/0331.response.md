Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i` are determined. `m` is greater than 0. `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `s` is greater than 0. If `i` == 0 and `j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is considered.***
