Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], all elements in `dp` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute again `k` is 1. If i == 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables remain the same except for the elements in `dp`, which are updated based on the given formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
