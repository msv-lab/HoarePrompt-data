Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are not explicitly given, so the output state will be that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, n is at least 2, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with updated elements, k is 2 for the loop to execute again.**
