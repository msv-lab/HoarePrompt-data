Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is 2. After the execution of the if block, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s are positive integers with the specified constraints. dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated as described based on the else part execution.***
