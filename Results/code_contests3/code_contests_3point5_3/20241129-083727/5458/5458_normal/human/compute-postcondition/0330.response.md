Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous states of the variables are known, and based on those, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0; Updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, `i` are determined, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0; Updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
