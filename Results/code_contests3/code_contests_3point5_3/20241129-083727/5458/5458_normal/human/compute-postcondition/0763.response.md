According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since `k` is ranging from 1 to `s + 1`, `k` should be 1. All other variables remain the same as the initial values.
State: **`N` will be `n^2 - 1`, `M` will remain the same as the initial value, `S` will be `s + m`, `mod` will remain unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` can be 0 or not, `j` will be less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` will be fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`**
