Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 2, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute one more time, k is within the range of 1 to s, i is equal to 0. Furthermore, if j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
