Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], all elements in `dp` have been updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute again `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, then the loop continues executing with the updated values of variables.***
