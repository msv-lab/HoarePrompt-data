According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it becomes `s + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], for the loop to execute the third time `k` is s + 1**
