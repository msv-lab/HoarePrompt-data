According to the code, the loop executes for each value of k from 1 to s. So, for the loop to execute, the variable k must be within the range of 1 to s. 

Since the loop is dependent on the value of k, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `mod` is 100000, `n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)] with all elements updated based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`**
