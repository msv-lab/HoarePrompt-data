Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not modified by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `m` is at least 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
