Output State: At the end of the loop execution, all values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i` are all incremented by 1. `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` becomes 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.
