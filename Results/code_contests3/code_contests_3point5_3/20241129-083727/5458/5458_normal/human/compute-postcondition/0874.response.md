Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is a bitwise AND operation with 1, `j + 1` increases the value of `j` by 1, and `k` remains the same. Since `i` is the total number of times the loop iterated, `j` is m + 3, and `k` is between 1 and s, the assignment updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is still n^2, M remains unchanged, S is s + m, mod remains the same, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, i is either the total number of times the loop iterated, j is m + 3, k is between 1 and s, dp is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
