Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers with the specified constraints. `mod` is 100000. `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)]. `j` is 1. The loop is executed for the first time. If i is equal to 0, then if j is greater than or equal to k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, the value of dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
