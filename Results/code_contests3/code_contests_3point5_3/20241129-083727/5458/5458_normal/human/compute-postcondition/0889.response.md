Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is n^2, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is m + 2 in the if part and m + 3 in the else part, `k` is between 1 and s + 1, `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0 in the if part and not equal to 0 in the else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` in both parts, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is `k + 1.
Output State: **`N` is n^2, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is s + m, `mod` remains the same, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is m + 2 in the if part and m + 3 in the else part, `k` is between 1 and s + 1, `dp` is fully updated with the final values calculated from each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0 in the if part and not equal to 0 in the else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` in both parts, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is `k + 1**.
