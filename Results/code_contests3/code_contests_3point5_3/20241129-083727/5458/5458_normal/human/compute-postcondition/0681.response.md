Output State: **At the end of the if else block, the variables N, M, S, mod, s, m, i, j remain the same as at the start of the next iteration. dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The loop will only execute the last time when k is equal to s. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.**
