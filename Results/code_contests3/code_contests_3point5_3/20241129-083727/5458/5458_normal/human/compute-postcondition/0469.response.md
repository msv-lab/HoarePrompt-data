Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly given, but the assignment follows a pattern where the value is copied from the previous position. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain integers, the loop condition holds, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **All variables remain integers, loop condition holds, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
