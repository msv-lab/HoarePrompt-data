According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N, M, S, mod, s, m, j is 2, i is 0, k is s, dp is fully updated. For the loop to execute one more time, k should be equal to s at the start of the next iteration. Also, based on the conditions given, the following state modifications need to be made:

If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of 1. So, dp[1][j + 1][k] will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
State: **At the start of the next iteration N, M, S, mod, s, m, j is 2, i is 0, k is s, dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1, for the loop to execute the last time k should be equal to s**
