Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, and `m` are all integers. `s` is at least 1, `j + 1` is less than `m - 1` for the loop to execute again. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
