Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. The variables i, j, and k are 0, 2, and s respectively. After execution, the value of dp[1][j + 1][k] will be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: At the start of the next iteration N, M, S, mod, s, m, j is 2, i is 0, k is s, dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **At the start of the next iteration N, M, S, mod, s, m, j is 2, i is 0, k is s, dp[1][j + 1][k] is 1**
