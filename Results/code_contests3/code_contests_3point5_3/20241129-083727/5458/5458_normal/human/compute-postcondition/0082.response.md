Example Answer:
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Since the value of j and k are not changing, the value remains the same in the new location. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m, k is 1, i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k.
