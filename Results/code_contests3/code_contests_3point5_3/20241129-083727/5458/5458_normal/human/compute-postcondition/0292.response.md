Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, the final values of N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, dp, k, i, and j are determined. For the loop to execute one more time, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is determined, j is less than or equal to m, and if i equals 0, j should be less than k for the condition dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be assigned the value 1. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
