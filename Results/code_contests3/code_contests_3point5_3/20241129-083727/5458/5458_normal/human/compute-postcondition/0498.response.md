Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i`, and `m` are all integers. `s` is at least 1, `j + 1` is less than `m - 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i == 0`, when `j >= k` is true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, after the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
