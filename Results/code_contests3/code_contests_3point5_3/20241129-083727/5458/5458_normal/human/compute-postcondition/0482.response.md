Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The value of `k - j` should be less than or equal to `s`. All variables remain integers.
Output State: **All variables remain integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `k + 1` remains less than or equal to `s`.**
