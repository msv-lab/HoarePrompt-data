Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers with the specified constraints, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time k is 1. If i == 0, then if j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated according to the addition operation and modulo calculation.***
