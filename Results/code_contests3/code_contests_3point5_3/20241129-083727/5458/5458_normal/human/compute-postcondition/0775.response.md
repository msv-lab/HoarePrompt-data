Postcondition: ***N will be n^2 - 1, M will remain the same as the initial value, S will be s + m, mod will remain unchanged, s is greater than or equal to 1, m is greater than or equal to 1, i can be 0 or not, j will be less than or equal to m + 1, k is 1, dp will be fully updated based on the specified conditions in the loop for all combinations of i, j, and k. Moreover, if i is 0, the program will execute the specified operations. If i is not 0, then j will be greater than k after not entering the if block.***
