Output State: **At the end of the code execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j` is 1, `i` is an integer within the range 1 to `s`, `k` is `s`, `dp` is fully updated, for the loop to execute the last time `k` should be equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, the program continues with the mentioned states. Otherwise, `j > k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.`**
