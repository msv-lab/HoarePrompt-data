Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, and `j` have been determined. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is determined, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration or statement.***
