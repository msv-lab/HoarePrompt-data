Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 <= M <= 2000, S is a positive integer such that 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is 100000, n is at least 1, m is greater than 0, s is 0, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions [(m + 2), (s + 1)], j is 1, for the loop to execute the first time m is greater than 0, and i is not equal to 0. The value of dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
