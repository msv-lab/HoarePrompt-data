Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `j`, `i`, `k+1` are integers within the range 1 to `s`, `k+1` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute another time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain within their specified ranges and conditions.***
