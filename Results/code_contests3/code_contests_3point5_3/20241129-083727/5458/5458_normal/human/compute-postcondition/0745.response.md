Postcondition: ***At the end of the execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `m`, `i` will be `n^2 - 1`, `j` will remain the same as the initial value, `k` will be equal to `s + 1`, `dp` will be fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute `m` has to be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, when `i` is equal to 0, the program state will be as described above, and `j` will be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` will be greater than `k`.***
