The function `func` reads input until the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, then it calculates values based on the constraints provided in the loop. It utilizes dynamic programming to populate a matrix `dp` with calculated values. The final output is the result obtained from the `dp` matrix. The function does not explicitly return any value but prints the result.
