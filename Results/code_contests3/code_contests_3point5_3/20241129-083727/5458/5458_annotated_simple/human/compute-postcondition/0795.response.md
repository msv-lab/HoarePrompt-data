According to the code, the loop iterates through the range from 1 to m+1, updating the values of dp based on certain conditions. At the end of the previous iteration, dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, mod is 100000, n, m, s are fixed, dp contains all final updated values, and j is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 2**
