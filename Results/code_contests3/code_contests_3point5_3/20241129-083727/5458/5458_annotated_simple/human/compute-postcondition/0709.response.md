Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, and `mod` remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1**
