According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range 1 to `m` inclusive. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is within that range. Additionally, the loop conditions do not depend on `mod`, `n`, `i`, `s`, or `dp`, so they can remain unchanged.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values**
