Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 3 and less than or equal to `s. If j >= k, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If i is 0, the specific condition is met. Otherwise, the general conditions are met.***
