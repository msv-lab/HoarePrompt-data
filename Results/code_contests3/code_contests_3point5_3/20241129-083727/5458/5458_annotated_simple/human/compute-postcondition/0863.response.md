According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1**
