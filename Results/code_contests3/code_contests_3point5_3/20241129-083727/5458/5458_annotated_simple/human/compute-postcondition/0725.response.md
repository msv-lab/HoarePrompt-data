Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values. If `i` is 0, `j` is one more than the previous value, `k` is two more than the previous value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is one more than the previous value, `k` is two more than the previous value. If `i` is not 0, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***
