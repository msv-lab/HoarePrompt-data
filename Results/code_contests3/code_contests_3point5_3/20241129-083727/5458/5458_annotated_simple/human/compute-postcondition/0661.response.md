According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
