According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.

Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is j+1**
