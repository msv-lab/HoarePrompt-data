According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop indicates that the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` starts at 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop.
State: **Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to s**
