According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s` and `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is greater than 0**
