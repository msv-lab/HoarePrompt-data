Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i, j, k` are fixed, `mod` is 100000, and `dp` contains all final updated values. The value of `s` remains constant, and it is greater than 0 for the first loop execution. Additionally, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` is 2. Since there is no change in other variables, the Output State is: *`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the first loop execution, `k` is 2. If `j` > `k`, the program continues with the same conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the first loop execution, `k` is 2. If `j` > `k`, the program continues with the same conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
