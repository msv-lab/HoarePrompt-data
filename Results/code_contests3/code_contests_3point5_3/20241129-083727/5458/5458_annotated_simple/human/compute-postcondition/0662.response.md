According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that k should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1, k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive)**
