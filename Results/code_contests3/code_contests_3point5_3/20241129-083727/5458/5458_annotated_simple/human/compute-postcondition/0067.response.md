Example Answer:
The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute again with an updated value of `k` which needs to be increased by 1 and still be less than or equal to `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, and `k` is increased by 1 but still less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, and `k` is increased by 1 but still less than or equal to `s`**
