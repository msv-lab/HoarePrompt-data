Postcondition: ***Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, `k` has been incremented by 1. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise the program remains in the same state as before the loop. If `i != 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
