According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and k is 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, k is 1**.
