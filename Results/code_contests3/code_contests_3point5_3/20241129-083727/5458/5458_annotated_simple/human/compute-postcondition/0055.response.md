According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k` and `s`. In this case, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`**
