Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The indices of `dp` are modified accordingly. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are fixed and not affected by this assignment. Since the loop needs to execute a third time, `s` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is greater than 0, and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
