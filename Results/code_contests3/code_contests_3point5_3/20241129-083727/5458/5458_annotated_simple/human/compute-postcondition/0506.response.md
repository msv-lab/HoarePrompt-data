Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is greater than 0. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` has been executed.**
