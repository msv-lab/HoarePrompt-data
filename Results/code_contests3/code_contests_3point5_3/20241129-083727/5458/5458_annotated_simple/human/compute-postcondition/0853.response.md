According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` should be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at a certain value within the range of 1 to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1**
