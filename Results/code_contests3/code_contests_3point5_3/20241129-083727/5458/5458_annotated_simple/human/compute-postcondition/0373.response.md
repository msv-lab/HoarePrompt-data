Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2 or greater, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod***
