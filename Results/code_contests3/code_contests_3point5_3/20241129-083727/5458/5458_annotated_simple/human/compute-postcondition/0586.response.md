According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `m` is fixed. In the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m+1`.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have a value based on the conditions in the loop code, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m+1**
