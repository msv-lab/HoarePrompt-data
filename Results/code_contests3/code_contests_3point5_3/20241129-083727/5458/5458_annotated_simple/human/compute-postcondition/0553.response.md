According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is fixed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2**.
