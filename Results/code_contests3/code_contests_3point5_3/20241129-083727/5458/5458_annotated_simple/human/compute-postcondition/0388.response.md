Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s, `i` is 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
