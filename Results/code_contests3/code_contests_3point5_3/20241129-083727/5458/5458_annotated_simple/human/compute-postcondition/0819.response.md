Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The indices are calculated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `j` is either 2 or 3, and `k` is 3, the new value will be assigned to either `dp[n^2 & 1][3 + 1][3]` or `dp[n^2 & 1][4][3]` depending on the value of `j`. The other variables remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3 for the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[n^2 & 1][3 + 1][3]` or `dp[n^2 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3 for the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[n^2 & 1][3 + 1][3]` or `dp[n^2 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1**
