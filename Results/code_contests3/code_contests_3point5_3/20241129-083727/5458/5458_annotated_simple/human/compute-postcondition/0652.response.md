Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since the loop is executing for the third time and s is greater than 0, the values of i, j, and k are fixed. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0, k is 3, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0, k is 3, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
