Output State: **mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is 0, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros, i is 1, j is 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of (dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod) added to its previous value for the loop to execute the next time k is within the range of 1 to s+1**
