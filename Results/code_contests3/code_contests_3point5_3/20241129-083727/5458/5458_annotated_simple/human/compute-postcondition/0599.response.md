Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m+1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, in the if part when i is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. In the else part, when i is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking into account the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with the modulo operation.***
