Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known, so we can calculate the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on that. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s+1` with final updated values, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` starts at 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s+1` with final updated values, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` starts at 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
