Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros, where each row has a length of `m + 2` and each column has a length of `s + 1`.**
