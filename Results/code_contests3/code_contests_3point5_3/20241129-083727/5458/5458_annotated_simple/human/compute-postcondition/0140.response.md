Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is less than `s`. If `i == 0`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`***
