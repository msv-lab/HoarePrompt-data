Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to its current value. The values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the provided formula.**
