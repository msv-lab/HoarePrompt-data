According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s` where `s` is greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s`.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is less than `s`**
