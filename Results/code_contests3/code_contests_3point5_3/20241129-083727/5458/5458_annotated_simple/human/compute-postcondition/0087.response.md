Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 1 and less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`.***
