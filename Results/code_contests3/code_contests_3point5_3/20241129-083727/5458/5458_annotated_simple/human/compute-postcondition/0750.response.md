Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is incremented by 1, values in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated based on the calculation `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
