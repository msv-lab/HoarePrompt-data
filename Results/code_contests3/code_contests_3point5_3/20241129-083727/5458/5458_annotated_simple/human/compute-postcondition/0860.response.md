Example Answer:
The value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in `dp` is incremented by the value at index [i & 1][j][k - j] in `dp` modulo `mod`. All other variables remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1**
