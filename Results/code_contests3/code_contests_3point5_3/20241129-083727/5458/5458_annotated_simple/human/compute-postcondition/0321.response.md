Postcondition: ***After printing the modulo of the final updated values of dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], the program remains in the same state with mod as 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` with final updated values for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is 0. In addition, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
