Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` has been updated based on the calculation in the code. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as per the formula `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
