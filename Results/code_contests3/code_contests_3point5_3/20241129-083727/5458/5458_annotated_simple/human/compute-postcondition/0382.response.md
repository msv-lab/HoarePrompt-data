Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same. `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` have all been finally updated. `i` is 0, `j` is either m or m-1, `k` is 3. If j >= k, then `dp` with indices [1][m][3] is 1. If the condition `i==0` is satisfied, the function executes the if part, otherwise, it executes the else part. In the if part, the state of the program variables is as described above with the additional condition that if j >= k, then `dp` with indices [1][m][3] is 1. In the else part, the state of the program variables is the same as described above, except for `j` being m + 1 instead of m or m-1.***
