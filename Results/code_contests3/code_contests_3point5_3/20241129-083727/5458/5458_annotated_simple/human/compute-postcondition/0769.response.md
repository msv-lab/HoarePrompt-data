Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k` after entering the if condition***
