According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the fixed values of `n`. If `i` is less than `n^2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and should be less than `n^2`.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than n^2**
