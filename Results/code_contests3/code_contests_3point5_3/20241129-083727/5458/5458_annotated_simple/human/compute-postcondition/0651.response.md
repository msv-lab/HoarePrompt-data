According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than 0, and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s` and `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0, k is 3**
