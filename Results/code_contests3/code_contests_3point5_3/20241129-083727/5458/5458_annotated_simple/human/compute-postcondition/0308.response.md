Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, in the else part, if `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
