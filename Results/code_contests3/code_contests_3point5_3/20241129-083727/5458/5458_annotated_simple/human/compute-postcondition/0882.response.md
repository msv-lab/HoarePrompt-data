Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than the new value of `k`. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
