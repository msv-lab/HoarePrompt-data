Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, k is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` with indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
