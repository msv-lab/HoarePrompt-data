According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s (inclusive). Since the loop is dependent on the variable k, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that k starts from 1 and ranges up to s. 

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` starts at 1 and ranges up to `s`**
