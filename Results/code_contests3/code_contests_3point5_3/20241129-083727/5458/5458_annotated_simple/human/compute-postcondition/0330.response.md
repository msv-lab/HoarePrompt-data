Output State: **After executing the if-else block, the final updated values of `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remain the same as before. The variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` are fixed. The value of `i` remains 0, `j` remains 1, and `k` retains its final updated values for the loop to execute the first time when `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If the condition `(j > k)` is true, the program state is as described. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.**
