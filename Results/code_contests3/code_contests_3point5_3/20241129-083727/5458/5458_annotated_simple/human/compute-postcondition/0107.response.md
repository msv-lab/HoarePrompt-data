Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values. The final values of the variables will be determined by the final iterations of the loop, following the conditions and calculations provided in the loop code.**
