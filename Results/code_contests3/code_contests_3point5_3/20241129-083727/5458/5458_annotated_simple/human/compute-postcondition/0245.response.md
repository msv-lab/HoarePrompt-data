Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is 0, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the updated value as per the loop conditions, and `i` is 0***
