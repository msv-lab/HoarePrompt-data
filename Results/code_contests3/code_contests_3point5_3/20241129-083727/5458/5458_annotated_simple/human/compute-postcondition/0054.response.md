Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2. If j >= k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and j is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the result of the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
