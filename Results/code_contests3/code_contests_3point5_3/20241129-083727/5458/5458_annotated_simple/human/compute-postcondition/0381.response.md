Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod. The indices are manipulated using bitwise operations. After execution, the values of dp, mod, n, m, s, i, j, and k remain the same with the final updated values. 
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3**
