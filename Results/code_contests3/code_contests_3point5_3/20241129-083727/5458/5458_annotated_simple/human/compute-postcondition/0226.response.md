Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s+1` with final updated values, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` starts at 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to 1 after the execution of the if else block.***
