According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n^2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be such that `i` is less than `n^2`.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values**
