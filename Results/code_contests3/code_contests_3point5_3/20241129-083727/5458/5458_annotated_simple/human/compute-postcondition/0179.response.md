Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the specified ranges. The value of `i` is updated to 1, `j` is updated to `m + 2`, and `k` remains the same as `s + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is within the range 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is equal to `s + 1` with all updated values.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is within the range 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is equal to `s + 1` with all updated values**
