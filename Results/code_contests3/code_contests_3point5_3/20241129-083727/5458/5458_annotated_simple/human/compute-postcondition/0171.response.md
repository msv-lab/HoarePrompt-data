Example Answer: 
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not altered by this operation. The output state is: 
`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values**
