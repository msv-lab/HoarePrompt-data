According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is between 1 and m inclusive. Before the loop starts, the state of `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remaining constant ensures that the loop can execute. The value of `mod` being 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` being fixed, and `dp` containing all final updated values after all iterations of the loop are also necessary for the loop to execute. Since `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 1.
