Example Answer: 
`n, m, s` are assigned values from the input split. The values of `n, m, s` are updated based on the input. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After printing the modulo of the final updated values of dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], the program remains in the same state with mod as 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` <= `n^2`, `j` = `m + 1`, and `k` with final updated values.
