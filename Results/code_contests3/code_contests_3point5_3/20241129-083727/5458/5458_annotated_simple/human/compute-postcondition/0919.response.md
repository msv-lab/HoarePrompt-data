According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, s is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. So the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0**
