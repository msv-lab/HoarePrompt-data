Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp` with respect to `mod`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2 or greater.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2 or greater**
