Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial state of the variables remains the same. For each iteration, the value of `k` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1**
