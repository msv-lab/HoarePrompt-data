Postcondition: ***Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, `k` has been incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
