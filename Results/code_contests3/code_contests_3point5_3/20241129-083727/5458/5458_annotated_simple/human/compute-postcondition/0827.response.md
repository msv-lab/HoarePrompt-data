Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is s. The final values in `dp` will be calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop code for each iteration.**
