Postcondition: ***Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the program fragment.***
