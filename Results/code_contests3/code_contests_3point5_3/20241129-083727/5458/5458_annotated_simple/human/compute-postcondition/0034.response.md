Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is updated with the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, and the 2D list `dp` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` has been updated**
