Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Since i is initially set to 0, after this operation, i becomes 1. The rest of the variables remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, dp contains all final updated values, for the loop to iterate once more, j is incremented by 1, k falls within the range of 1 to s (inclusive) with k incremented by 1, i is 1.
