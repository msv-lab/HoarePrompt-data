Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0, k is 3. If i equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not 0, after the execution of the code, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated based on the provided expressions.***
