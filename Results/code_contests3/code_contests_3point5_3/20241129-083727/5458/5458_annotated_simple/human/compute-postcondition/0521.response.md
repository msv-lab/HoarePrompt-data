According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is now 1. 
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
