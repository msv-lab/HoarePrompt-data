Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is 0, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros where each row has a length of m + 2 and each column has a length of s + 1, i is 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s. If i == 0, and if j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
