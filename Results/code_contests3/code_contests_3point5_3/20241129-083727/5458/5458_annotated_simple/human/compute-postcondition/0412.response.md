Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `j > k`, then the program execution continues with the updated values.***
