According to the code, the loop can execute if the range of `k` from 1 to `s + 1` is valid. Since `s` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that `s` is defined as `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than 0 and `k` starts at 1.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s+1` with final updated values, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` starts at 1**
