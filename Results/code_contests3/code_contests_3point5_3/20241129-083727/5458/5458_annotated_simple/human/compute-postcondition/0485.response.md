According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j`, `m`, and the loop condition. At the end of the previous iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed. 
For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` needs to be adjusted accordingly. If `i == 0`, `k` will also be incremented by 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, `k` will be incremented based on the loop conditions. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. 
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is adjusted based on the loop conditions, `k` is adjusted based on the loop conditions**
