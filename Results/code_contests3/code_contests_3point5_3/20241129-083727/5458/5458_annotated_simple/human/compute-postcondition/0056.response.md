Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` can either be 0 or 1, the updated value of `i` will be `i + 1 & 1`, which results in either 0 or 1. The value of `j` is 2, so after incrementing it by 1, `j` becomes 3. As `k` is used in the loop condition and should be less than or equal to `s`, it remains the same value. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is the same value as before, and the updated value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is the same value as before, and the updated value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
