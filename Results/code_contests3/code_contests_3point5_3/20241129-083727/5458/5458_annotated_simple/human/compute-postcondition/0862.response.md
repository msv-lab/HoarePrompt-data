Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1. The loop will update the values in dp based on the conditions provided in the loop code for all valid values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
