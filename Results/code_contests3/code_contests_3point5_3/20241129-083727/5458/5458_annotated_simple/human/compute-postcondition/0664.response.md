Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1, k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), i is equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than or equal to k.***
