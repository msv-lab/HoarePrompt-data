Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The indices of `dp` are updated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, and `k` is 2. After the update, the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1**
