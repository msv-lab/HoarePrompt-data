Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated accordingly. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `j > k`, then the program execution continues with the updated values.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s.
