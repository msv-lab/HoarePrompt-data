Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
