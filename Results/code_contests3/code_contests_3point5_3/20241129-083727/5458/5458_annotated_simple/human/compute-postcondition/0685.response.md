Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain constant, and `dp` contains all final updated values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) with `k` incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) with `k` incremented by 1**
