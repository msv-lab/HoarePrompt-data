According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` ranges from 2 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 4, `i` has been updated. For the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
