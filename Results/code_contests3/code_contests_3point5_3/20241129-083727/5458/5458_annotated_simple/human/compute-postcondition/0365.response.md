According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values are the same, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 1. Assuming the loop executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop executes for the first time, `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is greater than 0. 

After the if-else block executes, if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k` must hold true.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
