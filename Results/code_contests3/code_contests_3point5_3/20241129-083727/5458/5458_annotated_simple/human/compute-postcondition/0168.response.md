Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` with the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, and `k` is equal to `s+1`, the new value at the updated index is equal to the previous value at index `[i][j][k]`. Hence, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values**
