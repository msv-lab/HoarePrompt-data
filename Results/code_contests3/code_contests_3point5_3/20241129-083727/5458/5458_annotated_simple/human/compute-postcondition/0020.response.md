Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros where each row has a length of `m + 2` and each column has a length of `s + 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, the value of `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**.
