Output State: **Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `dp` contains all final updated values, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is executed.**
