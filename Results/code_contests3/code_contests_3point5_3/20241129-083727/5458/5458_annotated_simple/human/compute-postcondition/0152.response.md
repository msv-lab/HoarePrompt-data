Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is such that i is less than n^2, m is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with all updated values, i is 2, j is within the range 1 to m, k is equal to s with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time j is j+1, i is not equal to 0. Additionally, if j > k, then the program will execute the if part. Otherwise, the program will not enter the else part.***
