Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 after the if else block executes.***
