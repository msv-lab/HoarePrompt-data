Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices are updated accordingly based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` remain constant, and the loop conditions are met, the output state remains the same with the updated values in `dp`.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
