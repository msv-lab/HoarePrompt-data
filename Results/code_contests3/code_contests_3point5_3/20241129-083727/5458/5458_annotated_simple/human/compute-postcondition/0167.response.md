Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values, and if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
