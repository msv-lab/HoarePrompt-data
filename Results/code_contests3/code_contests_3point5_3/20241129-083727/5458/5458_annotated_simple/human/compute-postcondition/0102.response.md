Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 3 and less than or equal to `s`. If `j` > `k`, the program continues with the given conditions.***
