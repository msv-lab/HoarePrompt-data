Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is 100000. The indices of `dp` are updated accordingly. The value of `j` is fixed at 3, and `k` is set to 2 to execute the loop one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
