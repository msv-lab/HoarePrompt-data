Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed. The final values of `j` and `k` depend on the loop conditions, if `i == 0`, `j` will be incremented by 1 and `k` will be incremented by 1 if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `j` will be incremented based on the loop conditions, and `k` will be incremented based on the loop conditions. The final values of `dp` will depend on the calculations within the loop.**
