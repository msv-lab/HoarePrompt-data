Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `mod` is 100000. Since the value of `j` is either 3 or 4 and `k` is 3, the condition `j > k` is satisfied. Thus, the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is performed. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are either 0 or 1, 3 or 4, and 3 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: *`mod` is 100000, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 3 and less than or equal to `s*. 
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 3 and less than or equal to `s`**
