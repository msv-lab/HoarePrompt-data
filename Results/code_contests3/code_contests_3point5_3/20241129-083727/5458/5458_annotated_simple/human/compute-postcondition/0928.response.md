Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is n, `j` is m + 2, `k` is s. The loop will update `dp` values based on the conditions mentioned in the loop code for all values of `i`, `j`, and `k` within the specified ranges.**
