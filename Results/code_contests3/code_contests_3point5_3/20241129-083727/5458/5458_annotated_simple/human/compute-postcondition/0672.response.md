Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. The indices of `dp` are modified accordingly. The loop conditions and fixed values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, and `i` remain the same. The condition `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program retains the aforementioned conditions. 
Output State: **`dp` with updated indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), the value of `i` is not equal to 0**
