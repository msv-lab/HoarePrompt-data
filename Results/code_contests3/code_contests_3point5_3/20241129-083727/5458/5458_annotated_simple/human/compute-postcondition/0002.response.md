Example Answer:
The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function takes in multiple inputs separated by spaces, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. Since the initial state does not mention the values of `n`, `m`, or `s`, the output state will only include the updated variables.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers**
