Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s. If i == 0, the program does not update any variables. If i != 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.***
