Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with updated values. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if part with the given conditions. Otherwise, the program does not enter the if part. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
