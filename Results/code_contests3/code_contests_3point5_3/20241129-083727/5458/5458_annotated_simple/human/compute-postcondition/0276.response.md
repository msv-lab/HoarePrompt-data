According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s+1`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to either 1 if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, or it will be equal to the updated value based on the loop conditions. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 3, `k` is `s+1`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to either 1 if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, or it will be equal to the updated value based on the loop conditions**.
