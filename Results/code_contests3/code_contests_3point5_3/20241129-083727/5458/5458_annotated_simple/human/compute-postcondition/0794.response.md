Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1. The loop updates the values of `dp` based on the conditions provided, and after all iterations, `dp` will contain the final updated values for all indices.**
