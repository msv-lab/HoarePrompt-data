According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be incremented by 1 and `j` should be set to m + 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0**
