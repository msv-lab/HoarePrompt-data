According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to s. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, `k` is s. Since k is currently equal to s, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of k should be s + 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, `k` is s + 1**
