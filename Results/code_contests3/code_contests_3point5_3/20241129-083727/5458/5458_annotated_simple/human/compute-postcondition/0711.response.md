Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the loop will execute one more time as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The other variables remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1.
