According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than 0. Since `k` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is greater than 0**
