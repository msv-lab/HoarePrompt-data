Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The indices `i` and `j` are updated according to the previous values, and `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**
