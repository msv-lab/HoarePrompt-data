Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` remain the same. After execution, the state of `dp` with all final updated values is changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program execution continues with the mentioned variable values and conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program execution continues with the mentioned variable values and conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
