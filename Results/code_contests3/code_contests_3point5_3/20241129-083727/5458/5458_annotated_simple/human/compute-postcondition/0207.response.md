Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is within the range 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is equal to `s + 1` with all updated values. The final values of `dp` will be determined by the conditions in the loop for each iteration, accordingly updating the values based on the given conditions.**
