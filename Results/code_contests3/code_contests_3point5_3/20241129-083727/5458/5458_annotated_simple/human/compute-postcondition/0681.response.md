Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array with the modulo operation on the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` using the constant `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain fixed, `dp` contains all the final updated values, and `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. The range of `k` is from 1 to `s` inclusive, and `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: *`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) with `k` incremented by 1, `i` is set to 1.
Output State: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) with `k` incremented by 1, `i` is set to 1***.
