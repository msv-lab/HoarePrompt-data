According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is fixed. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are as follows:
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` has been updated based on the calculation in the code, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**.
