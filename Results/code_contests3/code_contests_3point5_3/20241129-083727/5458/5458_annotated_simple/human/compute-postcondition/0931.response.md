Example Answer:
The program prints the result of the modulo operation of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` with 100000. The values of `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, and `i` is `n`, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is n, `j` is m + 2, `k` is s.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is n, `j` is m + 2, `k` is s**
