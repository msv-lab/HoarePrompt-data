Example Answer:
The value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is assigned the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The indices i, j, and k remain constant, and the value of dp at those indices is already updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3 for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3 for the next iteration of the loop**
