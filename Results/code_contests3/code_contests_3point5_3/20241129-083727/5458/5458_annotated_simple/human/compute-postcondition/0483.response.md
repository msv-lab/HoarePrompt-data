Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed. If `i == 0`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `j` is incremented by 2, `k` is incremented by 2. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
