Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, and `k` is less than or equal to `s` with updated values. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then the loop will execute again with the value of `k` increased by 1 as long as it is less than or equal to `s. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `k` is still less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again.***
