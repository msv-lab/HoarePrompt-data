Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The indices of `dp` change according to the formula provided, and `mod` remains constant. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` remain the same, while `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1**
