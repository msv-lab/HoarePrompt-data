According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is less than or equal to m. Before the loop starts, dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to j is 1, since the loop starts at 1. 
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1**
