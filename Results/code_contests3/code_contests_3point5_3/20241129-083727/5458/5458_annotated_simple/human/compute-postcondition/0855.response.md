Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` and `j` values remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program maintains the same state as before the if statement.***
