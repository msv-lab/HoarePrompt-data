Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list. If `j >= k`, the value at index [2][2][k] is updated. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the sum of `(dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod)` and its previous value for the loop to execute the next time `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`.***
