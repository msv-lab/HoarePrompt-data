Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, and `k` is equal to `s`. Since the assignment is based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly used for calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: mod is 100000, n is such that i is less than n^2, m is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with all updated values, i is 2, j is within the range 1 to m, k is equal to s with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time j is j+1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **mod is 100000, n is such that i is less than n^2, m is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with all updated values, i is 2, j is within the range 1 to m, k is equal to s with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time j is j+1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
