Example Answer:
The value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is incremented by the value at index [i & 1][j][k - j] in dp modulo mod. The indices i, j, and k are being updated based on the initial state. After this execution, the dp array will have some modified values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, mod, n, m, s, dp with all final updated values, i is either 0 or 1, j is either m+1 or m, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s, and if j > k, then the program execution continues with the updated values.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, mod, n, m, s, dp with all final updated values, i is either 0 or 1, j is either m+1 or m, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s, and if j > k, then the program execution continues with the updated values.**
