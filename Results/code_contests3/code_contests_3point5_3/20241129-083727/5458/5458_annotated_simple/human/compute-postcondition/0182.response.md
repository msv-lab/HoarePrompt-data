Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is within the range 1 to `m+2`, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
