Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**
