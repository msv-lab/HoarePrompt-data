Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0***
