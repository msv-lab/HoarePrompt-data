Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is 100000. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time are `s` greater than 1 and `i` not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, all the mentioned conditions hold true. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
