Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
