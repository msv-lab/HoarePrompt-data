Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` falls within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) with `k` incremented by 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
