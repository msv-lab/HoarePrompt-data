According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is 3 and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m+1`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m+1, k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
