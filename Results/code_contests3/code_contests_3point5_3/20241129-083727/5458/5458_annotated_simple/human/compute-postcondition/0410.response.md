Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are either 0 or 1, `m+1` or `m`, and the next value in the range from 1 to `s` respectively. Therefore, after execution, the updated values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are as follows:
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**
