Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, `k` is less than or equal to `s` with updated values, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is 1, where `k + 1` is still less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again.***
