Example Answer:
The value at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in the `dp` array is assigned the value at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, m-1, and 3 respectively. The `dp` array with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same. After execution, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m, `k` is 3**
