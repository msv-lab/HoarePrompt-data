Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of variables are as follows: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s], `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. After execution, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and is added with modulo. 
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are either 0 or 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
