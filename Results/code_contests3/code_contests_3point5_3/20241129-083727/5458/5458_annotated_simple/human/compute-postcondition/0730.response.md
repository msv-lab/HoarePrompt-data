According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range 1 to s inclusive. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
