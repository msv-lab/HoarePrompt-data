According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to iterate once more, `j` requires an increment by 1, k falls within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), i is set to 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0, then `dp` is updated with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] based on the conditions specified.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, k needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` equals 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to iterate once more, `j` requires an increment by 1, k falls within the range of 1 to s (inclusive) with k incremented by 1, i is set to 0**
