Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
