Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
