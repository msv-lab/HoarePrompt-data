According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range 1 to s + 1. Since k is equal to s + 1, it implies that s is at least 0. To execute the loop one more time, k should be within the range 1 to s + 2.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m+1`, `k` is equal to `s+1` with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is within the range 1 to `m+2`**
