According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute again, `k` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `k` is incremented by 2. If i == 0, `j` is 2 and values in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are not updated. Otherwise, `j` is 2 and values in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated based on the calculation `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
