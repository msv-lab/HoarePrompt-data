Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, k is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp` with indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given formulas.***
