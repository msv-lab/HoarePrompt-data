Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
