Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices are updated based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. As `j` is 4, `i` has been updated, and `k` ranges from 2 to `s + 1`, the updated values of the indices are calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 4, `i` has been updated, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` ranges from 2 to `s + 1`.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 4, `i` has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `k` ranges from 2 to `s + 1`**
