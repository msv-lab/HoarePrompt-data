According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `k`, and the conditions related to `dp` values. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1. For the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `m + 2`.
2. Since `j` is now `m + 2`, the condition `j >= k` should be evaluated to check if `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1 or derived from other conditions.
3. If the conditions for assigning values to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are met, update the values accordingly based on the conditions specified in the code.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0**.
