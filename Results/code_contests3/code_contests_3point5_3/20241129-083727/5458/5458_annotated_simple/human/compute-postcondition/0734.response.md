Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k, `dp` with indices [1][2][k] is assigned the value 1.***
