Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute the second time, `s` is greater than 0, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
