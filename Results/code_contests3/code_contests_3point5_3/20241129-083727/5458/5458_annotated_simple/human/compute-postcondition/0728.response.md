According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` which ranges from 0 to n^2 - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, and `dp` contains all final updated values. Since `i` ranges from 0 to n^2 - 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1**
