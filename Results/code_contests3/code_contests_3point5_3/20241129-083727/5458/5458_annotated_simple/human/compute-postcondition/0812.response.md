Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices for `dp` are updated accordingly. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `mod` remain constant. The loop will execute one more time as `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is 2**
