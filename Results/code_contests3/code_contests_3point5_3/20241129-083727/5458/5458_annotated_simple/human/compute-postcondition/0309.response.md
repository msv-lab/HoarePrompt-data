Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 2, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0. Depending on the conditions within the loop, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be either 1 if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, or it will be the updated value based on the loop conditions.**
