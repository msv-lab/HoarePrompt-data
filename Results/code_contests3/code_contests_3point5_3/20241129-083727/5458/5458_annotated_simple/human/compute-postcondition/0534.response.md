According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be adjusted based on the condition. If `i` is equal to 0, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is adjusted based on the condition**
