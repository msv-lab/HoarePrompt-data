According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `m` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m+1`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `m` should be at least 1. 
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s+1` with final updated values**
