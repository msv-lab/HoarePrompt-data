Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the new value assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is the same as the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
