According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s (inclusive). Before the loop starts, dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remaining the same indicates the initial state of the dp array. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
