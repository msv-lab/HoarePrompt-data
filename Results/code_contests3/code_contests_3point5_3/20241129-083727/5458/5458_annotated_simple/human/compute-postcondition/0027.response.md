Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is greater than 0, s is 0, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros, i is 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute the next time k is within the range of 1 to s+1. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues.***
