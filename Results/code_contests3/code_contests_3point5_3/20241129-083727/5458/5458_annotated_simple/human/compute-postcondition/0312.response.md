According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, so it can certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **After printing the modulo of the final updated values of dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], the program remains in the same state with mod as 100000, n, m, and s fixed, dp with all final updated values, i <= n^2, j = m + 1, and k with final updated values**
