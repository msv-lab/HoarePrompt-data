According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j ranges from 1 to m+1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 is already satisfied. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` is 1, `n`, `m`, `s` have assigned values, `dp` is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1] with all values set to 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
