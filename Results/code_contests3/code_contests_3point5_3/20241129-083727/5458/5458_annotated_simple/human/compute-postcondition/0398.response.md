According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` have specific values as mentioned. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Update `k` to the next value in the range from 1 to s.
- Based on the conditions mentioned in the loop, update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**.
