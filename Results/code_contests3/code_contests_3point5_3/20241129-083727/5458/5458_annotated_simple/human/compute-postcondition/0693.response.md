Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, and after all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp` will hold the final calculated values based on the conditions specified in the loop code.**
