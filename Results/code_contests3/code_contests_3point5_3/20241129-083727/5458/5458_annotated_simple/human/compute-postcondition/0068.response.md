Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, and `k` is increased by 1 but still less than or equal to `s**.
