According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are fixed does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is now 1.
