Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The indices are manipulated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `i` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` remains 2, the new indices become `[2][j + 1][2]`. The other variables remain constant. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0, `dp[2][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0, `dp[2][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1**
