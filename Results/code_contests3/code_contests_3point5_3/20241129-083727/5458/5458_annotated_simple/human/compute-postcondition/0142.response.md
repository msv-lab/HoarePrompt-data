According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the range 1 to `m` so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 2, `j` is within the range 1 to `m`, `k` is equal to `s` with all updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1**
