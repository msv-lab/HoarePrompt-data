According to the code, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, the indices of `dp` remain the same, so no adjustment needed there. Since `j` ranges from 1 to m+1, `j` should be set to 1 at the beginning of the loop. The loop will iterate through values of `j` from 1 to m, so for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 1.

State: **Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
