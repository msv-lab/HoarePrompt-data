According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `j` is less than `k` and `s` is greater than the new value of `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than the new value of `k`, and `j` must be less than `k`.
