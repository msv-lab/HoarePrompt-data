Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. After the execution of the if else block, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if i is 0. Otherwise, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` has been updated based on the calculation in the code, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
