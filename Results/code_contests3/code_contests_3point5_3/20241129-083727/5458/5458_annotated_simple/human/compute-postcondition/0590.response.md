Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1. The loop is to execute one more time, so `j` will be less than or equal to `m + 1` for the next iteration. `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, and `i` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1, k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1**
