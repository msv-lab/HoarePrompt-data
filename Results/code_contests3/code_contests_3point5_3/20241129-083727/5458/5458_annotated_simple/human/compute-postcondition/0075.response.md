According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `k` is initialized to 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `k` is 1 and less than or equal to `s`**
