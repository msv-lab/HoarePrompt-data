Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is s, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `i` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `s`, after the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][s] where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][s] % mod. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][s - j]` modulo `mod`.**
