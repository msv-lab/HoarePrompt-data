According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `m`, and `k`. In this case, `j` is incremented in each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is either `m` or `m-1`, `k` is `s`, and the `dp` array remains the same. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be updated to 1.
- `j` needs to be increased by 1.
- `k` remains the same.
- The `dp` array should be updated accordingly based on the conditions provided in the loop.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is s**.
