According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0.  The loop will execute for the second time if `k` is less than `s`. After the loop executes, `k` is incremented by 1. At the start of the next iteration, `k` becomes 2. 
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0**
