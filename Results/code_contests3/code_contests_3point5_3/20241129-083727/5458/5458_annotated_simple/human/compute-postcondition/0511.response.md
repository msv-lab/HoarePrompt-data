Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices and variables are fixed as mentioned in the initial state, so the output state remains the same for all variables and indices.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is greater than 0**
