Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3 for the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program executes as described in the postcondition of the if part. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.**
