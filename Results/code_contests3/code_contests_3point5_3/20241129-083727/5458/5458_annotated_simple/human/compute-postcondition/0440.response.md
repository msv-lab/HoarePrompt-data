Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The variables `i, j, k` are fixed, and `mod` is 100000. The state of `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains unchanged. After execution, `k` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, `k` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, `k` has been incremented by 1**
