Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m-1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is 0. Furthermore, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
