According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. So, for the next iteration, `k` will be 2 and the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0, k is 2**
