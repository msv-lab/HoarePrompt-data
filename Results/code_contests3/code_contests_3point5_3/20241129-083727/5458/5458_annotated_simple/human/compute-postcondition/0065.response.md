Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3 or 2, `k` is less than or equal to `s` with updated values and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, for the loop to execute again the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to be increased by 1 and still be less than or equal to `s**
