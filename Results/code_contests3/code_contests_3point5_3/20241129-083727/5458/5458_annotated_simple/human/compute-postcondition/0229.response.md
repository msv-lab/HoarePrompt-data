Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or `i+1`, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 1, `k` is equal to `s+1` with final updated values, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` starts at 2. If `j > k`, the program continues without any changes to the state.***
