Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 1, j can be any value within the range 1 to m + 2, and k is equal to s + 2 with all updated values, the specific values of i, j, and k are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: mod is 100000, n is such that i is less than n^2, m is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with all updated values, i is 1, j is within the range 1 to m + 2, k is equal to s + 2 with all updated values, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **mod is 100000, n is such that i is less than n^2, m is greater than 0, dp is a 2D list with all updated values, i is 1, j is within the range 1 to m + 2, k is equal to s + 2 with all updated values, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
