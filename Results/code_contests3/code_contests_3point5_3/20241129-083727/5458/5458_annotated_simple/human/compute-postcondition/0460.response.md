Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The indices are updated accordingly, and the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
