According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 1, `k` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than the new value of `k`. If the conditions are met, the loop will execute again.
