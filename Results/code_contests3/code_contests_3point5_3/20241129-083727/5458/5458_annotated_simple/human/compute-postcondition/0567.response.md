According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k`, `j`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` was 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop:
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` should be 2**
