Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0, k is 2. If i == 0 and j >= k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp` values are updated according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for the else part.***
