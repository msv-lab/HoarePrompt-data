Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` has been updated, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. The values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop code, considering the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and modulo operations.**
