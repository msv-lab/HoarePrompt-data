Example Answer:
A 3D list `dp` is created with dimensions [2][m + 2][s + 1], filled with 0s. The previous values of variables `s`, `m`, and `n` are known, and the final updated values of `dp` are initialized to all 0s. The program remains in the same state with `mod` as 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` <= `n^2`, `j` = `m + 1`, and `k` with final updated values. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **After printing the modulo of the final updated values of dp with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], the program remains in the same state with mod as 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` <= `n^2`, `j` = `m + 1`, and `k` with final updated values. If n, m, and s are all 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
