Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0 and at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all the final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `i` is less than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as 1. If `i == 0`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`***.
