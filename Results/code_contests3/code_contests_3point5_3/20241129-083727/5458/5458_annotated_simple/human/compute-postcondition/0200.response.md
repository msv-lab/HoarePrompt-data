Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is such that `i` is less than `n^2`, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with all updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is within the range 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is the next value within the range 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
