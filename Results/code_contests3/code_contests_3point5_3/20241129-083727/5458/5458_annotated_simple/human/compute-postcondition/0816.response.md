Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The indices for `dp` are updated based on the current values of `i, j, k`. The values of `i, j, k` are fixed, and `mod` is a constant. After execution, the `dp` array contains the final updated values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 3, `k` is 2**
