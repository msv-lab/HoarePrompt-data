Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. After running the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
