According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values after all iterations of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
