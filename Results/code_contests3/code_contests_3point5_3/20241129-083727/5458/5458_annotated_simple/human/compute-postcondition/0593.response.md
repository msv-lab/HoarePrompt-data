Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m+1, k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
