According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mod` is 100000 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros where each row has a length of `m + 2` and each column has a length of `s + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
