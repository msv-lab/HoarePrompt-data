Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is m + 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
