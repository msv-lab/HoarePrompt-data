Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `i` has been updated. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
