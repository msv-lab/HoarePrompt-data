Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program remains in the same state as before the if else block executes.***
