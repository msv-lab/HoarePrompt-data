According to the code, the loop will execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`**
