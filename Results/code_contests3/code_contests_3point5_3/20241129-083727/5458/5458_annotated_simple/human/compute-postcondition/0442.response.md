According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` has all final updated values, `k` has been incremented by 1**
