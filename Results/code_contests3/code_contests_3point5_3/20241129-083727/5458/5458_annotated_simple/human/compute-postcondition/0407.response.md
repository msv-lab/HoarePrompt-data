According to the given code snippet, the loop executes based on the range of values for `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:

1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated.
2. `k` should be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`.

Therefore, the modified state for the start of the next iteration will be as follows:

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s**.
