According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and the conditions specified in the if and else parts. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 since `j` should be less than or equal to `m + 1` for the loop to continue.
- The value of `k` should be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`.

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 3, `i` has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 2 to `s`**
