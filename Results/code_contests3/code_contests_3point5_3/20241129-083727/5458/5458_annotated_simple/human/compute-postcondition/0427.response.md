Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to s. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Also, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
