Since it is a `while 1` loop, it will continue indefinitely unless there is a break condition within the loop body. Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, no states need to be adjusted as the loop will automatically repeat. 

State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
