Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0, k is 3. After the code execution, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated according to the provided expressions.**
