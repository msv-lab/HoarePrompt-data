Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is one more than the previous value, `k` is two more than the previous value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is one more than the previous value, `k` is two more than the previous value.***
