According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, and `j` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m` and `k` should be incremented by 1.
