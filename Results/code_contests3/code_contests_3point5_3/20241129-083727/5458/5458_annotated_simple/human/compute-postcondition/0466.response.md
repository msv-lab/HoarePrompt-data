According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.
