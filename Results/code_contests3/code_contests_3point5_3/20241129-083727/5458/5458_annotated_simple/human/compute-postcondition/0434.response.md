Example Answer:
If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since no specific values are provided for `i`, `j`, and `k`, the output state will be based on these conditions. Therefore, the output state is: Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
