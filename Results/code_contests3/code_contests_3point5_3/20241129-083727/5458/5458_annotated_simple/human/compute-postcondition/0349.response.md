Postcondition: ***After executing the if-else block, the final updated values of `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remain the same as before. The variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` are fixed. The value of `i` remains 0, `j` remains 1, and `k` retains its final updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `(j > k)` is true, `k` must be less than `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, the program continues with the execution. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `(j > k)` is true, the program executes further only if `k` is less than `s`.***
