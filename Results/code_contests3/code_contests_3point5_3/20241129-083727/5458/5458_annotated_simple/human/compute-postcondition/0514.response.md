Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. Since the previous state of `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, the only change is in the specific index `j + 1` in the second dimension. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is greater than 0. If j > k, the program remains unchanged.
