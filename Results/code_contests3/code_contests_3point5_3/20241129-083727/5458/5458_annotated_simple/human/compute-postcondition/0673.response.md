Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `mod` is 100000. The values of `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed and `j` is incremented by 1. The variable `k` ranges from 1 to `s` (inclusive), and the value of `i` is not equal to 0. 
Output State: **`dp` with updated indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s], `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive), the value of `i` is not equal to 0**
