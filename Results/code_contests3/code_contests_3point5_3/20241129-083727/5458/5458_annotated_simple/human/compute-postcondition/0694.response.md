According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, and `j` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m` and `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] should still remain constant.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`**
