According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than 0. Since `k` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3**
