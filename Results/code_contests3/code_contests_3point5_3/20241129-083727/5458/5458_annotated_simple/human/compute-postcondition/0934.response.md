Functionality: ** The function `func` reads inputs and processes them through a series of nested loops to update a dynamic programming array. It then prints the result modulo 100000. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. **

Note: The annotations mention the state of the program variables but do not fully capture the complexity of the nested loop logic and the array updates. The actual functionality involves processing inputs iteratively and updating the dynamic programming array to calculate a result that is printed at the end.
