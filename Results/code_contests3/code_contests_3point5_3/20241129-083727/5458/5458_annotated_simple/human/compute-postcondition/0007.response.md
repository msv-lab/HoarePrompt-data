According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, which means the program will break out of the loop. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` needs to be 1.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros where each row has a length of `m + 2` and each column has a length of `s + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1**
