Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1. The indices are updated as `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` respectively. The initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `m-1`, and 3 respectively. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `dp` with indices `[1][m][3]` is 1, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`dp` with indices `[1][m][3]` is 1, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is m, `k` is 3**
