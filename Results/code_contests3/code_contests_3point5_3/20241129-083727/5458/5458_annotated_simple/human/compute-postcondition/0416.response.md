Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains the same, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s, with specific conditions to update `dp` values based on the comparisons between `i`, `j`, and `k` as described in the loop code.**
