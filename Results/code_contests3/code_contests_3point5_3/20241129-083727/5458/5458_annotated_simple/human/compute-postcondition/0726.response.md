Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values. `j` is incremented by the total number of iterations, `k` is incremented by the total number of iterations. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to 1 for all combinations where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be calculated based on the previous values of `dp` according to the given conditions in the loop code.**
