Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is 2, `k` starts at 1 and ranges up to `s`. If i is 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Finally, after the execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
