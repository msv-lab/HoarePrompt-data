Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
