Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant and contains all final updated values, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0. If i == 0, `dp[2][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
