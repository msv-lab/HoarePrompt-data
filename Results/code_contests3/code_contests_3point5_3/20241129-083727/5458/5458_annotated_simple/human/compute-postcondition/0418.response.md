According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Since `i` ranges from 0 to n^2, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than n^2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to n^2 - 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to n^2. 
State: **Output State: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same as before the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` with all final updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is either m+1 or m, `k` ranges from 1 to s**
