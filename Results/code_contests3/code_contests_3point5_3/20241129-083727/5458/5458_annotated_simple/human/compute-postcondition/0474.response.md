Postcondition: ***`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s. If i == 0, and j >= k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, and j > k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
