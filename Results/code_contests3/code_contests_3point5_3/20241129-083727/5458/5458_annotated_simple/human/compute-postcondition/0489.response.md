Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` is 0, the new value of `i` will be 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains the same, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
