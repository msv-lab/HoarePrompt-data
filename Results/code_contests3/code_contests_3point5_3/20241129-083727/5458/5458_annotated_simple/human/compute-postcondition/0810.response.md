Example Answer:
The value of dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. The indices of dp change according to the current values of i, j, and k. The mod value is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is 2, and the updated value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 2][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is 2, updated value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
