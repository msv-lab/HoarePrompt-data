According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m`, `s`, and `n` are fixed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m` and `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` with indices [n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] remains constant, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are fixed, `dp` contains all final updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1**
