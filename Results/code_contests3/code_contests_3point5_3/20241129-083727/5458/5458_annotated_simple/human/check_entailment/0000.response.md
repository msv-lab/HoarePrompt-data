Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to fill the Bingo card squares while following the given constraints. The final output is the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000.

The program iterates through all possible combinations of integers that can be placed in the Bingo card squares and keeps track of the number of ways to achieve each sum. It correctly follows the rules specified in the problem description, such as ensuring that integers are arranged in ascending order in each column and that no two cards are the same.

Therefore, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for each input dataset.
