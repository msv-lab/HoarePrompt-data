Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It reads input values for N, M, and S until they are all zero. For each non-zero input set, it calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the conditions given in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the values and prints the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000.

The program iterates through the values of i, j, and k to update the dp array according to the conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the integers in each square are arranged in ascending order in every column. The final result printed is the correct remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
