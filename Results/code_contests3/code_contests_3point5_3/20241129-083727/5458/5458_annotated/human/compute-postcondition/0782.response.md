Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, `s` is greater than 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
