Output State: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if `i != 0`, then for the loop to have executed at least once with `s` at least 1, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, `j` is greater than `k`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.
