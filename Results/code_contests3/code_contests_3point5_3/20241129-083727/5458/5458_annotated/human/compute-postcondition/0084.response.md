Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m and s are user input integers, dp is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), i is 1, j is m + 2, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, j > k. After the execution of the if else block, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
