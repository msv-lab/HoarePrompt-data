Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[0][4][s]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is set to 4. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to s+1.**
