Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`**
