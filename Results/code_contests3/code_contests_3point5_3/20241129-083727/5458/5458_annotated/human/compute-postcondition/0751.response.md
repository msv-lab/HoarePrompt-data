Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. `k+1` is incremented by 1, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the state of the program is updated based on the calculations in the else part.***
