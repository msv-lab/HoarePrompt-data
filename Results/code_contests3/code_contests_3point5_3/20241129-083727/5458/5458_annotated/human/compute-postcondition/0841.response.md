Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The initial state provides that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
