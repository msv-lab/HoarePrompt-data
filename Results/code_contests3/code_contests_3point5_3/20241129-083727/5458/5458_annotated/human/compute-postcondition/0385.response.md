According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made to the state:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
