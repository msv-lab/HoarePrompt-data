Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration.
