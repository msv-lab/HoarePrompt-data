Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while all other variables retain their initial values. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then no variables are affected. 
Output State: **All variables remain integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
