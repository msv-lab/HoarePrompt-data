Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will execute the if block. Otherwise, the program will not execute the if block. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
