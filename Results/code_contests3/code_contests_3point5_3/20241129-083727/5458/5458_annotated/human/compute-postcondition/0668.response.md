Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than `m` and `k` is one more than its previous value. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. The condition `(j > k)` is true, indicating that the value of `j` is greater than the value of `k`***
