According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `k` remain the same, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `s + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m**.
