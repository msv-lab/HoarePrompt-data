Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than 0, the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k` can be calculated based on the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
