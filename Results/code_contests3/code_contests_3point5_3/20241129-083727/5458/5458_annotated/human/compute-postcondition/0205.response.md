Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`**
