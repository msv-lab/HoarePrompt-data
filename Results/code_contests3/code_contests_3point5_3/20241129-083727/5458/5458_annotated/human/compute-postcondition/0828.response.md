Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. The final values of the variables are determined by the conditions and calculations performed in the loop for all iterations. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.**
