Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s + 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s + 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
