According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, k should be incremented by 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue, j should be less than m+1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i=0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod = 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than `m+1`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`**
