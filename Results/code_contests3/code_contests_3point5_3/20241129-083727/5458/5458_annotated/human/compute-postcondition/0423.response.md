Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to 0, and when the condition `j >= k` is met, the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
