According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, so it can certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are user input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is `m`, `k` is `s`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated according to the conditions specified in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. The value printed is the modulo of `dp[n]`.**
