Postcondition: ***`n, m, s, j+1, k+1, i, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are all integers. If `i` is equal to 0, the program does not modify the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j >= k`, the state of the program variables will be determined based on the initial values of `dp, i, j, k`, and `mod`.***
