Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all elements in `dp` list have been updated, and `j` is incremented by 1, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is already known. Therefore, after execution, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, and if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
