Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same. If i == 0, then if j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If i != 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of the division of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by mod.***
