Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function continues with the incremented `j` and `i` values. Otherwise, the function does not alter any variables and proceeds with the existing values of `j` and `i`. If `i` is not equal to 0, all variables remain the same.***
