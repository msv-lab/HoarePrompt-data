Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions. If `j > k`, then depending on the value of `i` and `j`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either assigned the value `1` or the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1.***
