Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, the new value of `i + 1 & 1` will be the opposite of the previous value of `i`. The values of `j` and `k` are incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]**
