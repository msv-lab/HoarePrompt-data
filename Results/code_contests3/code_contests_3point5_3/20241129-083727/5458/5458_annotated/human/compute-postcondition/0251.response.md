Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is s, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
