Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `i == 0` and `j >= k`. Since the initial state values are given and the conditions are met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to 1. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=3, i` are all integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
