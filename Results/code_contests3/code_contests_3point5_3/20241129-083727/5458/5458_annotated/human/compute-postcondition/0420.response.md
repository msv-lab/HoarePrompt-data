According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in `dp` list have been updated does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than 0.

State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
