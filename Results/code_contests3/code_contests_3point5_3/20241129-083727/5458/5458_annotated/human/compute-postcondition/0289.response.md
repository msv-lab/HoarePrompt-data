Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. `k` is in the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
