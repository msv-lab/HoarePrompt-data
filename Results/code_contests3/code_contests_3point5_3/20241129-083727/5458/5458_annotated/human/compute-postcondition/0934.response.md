Functionality: **The function reads input from the user until the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero. For each set of non-zero inputs, it performs calculations on the `dp` array, and at the end of each iteration, it prints the modulo of a specific value from the `dp` array. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
