Output State: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of the modulo operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
