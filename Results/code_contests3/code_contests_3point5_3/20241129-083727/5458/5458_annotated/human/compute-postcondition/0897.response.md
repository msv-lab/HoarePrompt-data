According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, starting from `k=1` to `k=s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the initial state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `k` is now 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i`, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1**
