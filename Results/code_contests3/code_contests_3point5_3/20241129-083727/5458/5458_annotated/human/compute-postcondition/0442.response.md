According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, and if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 if it's less than or equal to `s`.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, and if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration.**
