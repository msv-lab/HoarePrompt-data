Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The values in `dp` have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, with the final values calculated using the modulo operation `% mod`.**
