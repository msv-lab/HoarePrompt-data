According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute, `k` should be in the range of 1 to `s` inclusive.

State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic, for the loop to execute the first time**
