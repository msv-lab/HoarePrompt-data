Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 1, `k` is now equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given calculation.***
