According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is greater than 0, m is 0, and s is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is 0, and `j` is now 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute**
