According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `s + 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than or equal to `m` and `k` is now 1.
State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m, `k` is 1**
