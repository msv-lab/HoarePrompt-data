Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so they remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same.
Output State: **All variables remain the same**
