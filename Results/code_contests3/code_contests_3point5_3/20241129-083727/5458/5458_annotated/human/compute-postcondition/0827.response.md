Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. The values of the variables are dependent on the conditions and calculations within the loop. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.**
