Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `n, m, s, j, k+1, i` are integers with `n, m, s` being at least 0. `j` is incremented by 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`n, m, s, j, k+1, i` are integers with `n, m, s` being at least 0. `j` is incremented by 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions**
