According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` needs to be 1
- `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` remain integers
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0**
