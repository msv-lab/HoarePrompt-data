Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement without making any changes. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
