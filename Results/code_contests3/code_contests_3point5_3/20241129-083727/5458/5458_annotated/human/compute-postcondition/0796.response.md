According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute again. Thus, the state needs to be modified as follows:

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers**
