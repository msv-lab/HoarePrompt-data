Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 3. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod after the execution of the if else block. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
