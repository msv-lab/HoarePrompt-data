Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
