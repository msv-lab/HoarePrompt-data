Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index `[0][4][s]` in `dp` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is set to 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `j` is set to 4. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
