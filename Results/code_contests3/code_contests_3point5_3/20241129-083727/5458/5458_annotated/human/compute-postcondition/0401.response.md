Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` can be calculated as `m + 2`, `m + 1`, and `2` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is `m + 2`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `2`, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
