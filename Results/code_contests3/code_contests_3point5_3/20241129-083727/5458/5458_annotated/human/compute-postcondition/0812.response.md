Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `k` is already incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, and `k` is already incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, and `k` is already incremented by 1**
