Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Based on the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `m + 1`, so `i + 1 & 1` will be 1. `j + 1` will be greater than `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. Therefore, this assignment will update the value at index `[1][m + 2][1]` in the `dp` list.
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is equal to `s`, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
