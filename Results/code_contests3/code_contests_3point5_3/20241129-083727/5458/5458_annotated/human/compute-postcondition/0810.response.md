Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Variables i, j, and k are all incremented by 1, so the new values are i+1, j+1, and k+1 respectively. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s are greater than 0, j+1, k+1, i+1, dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k], dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k] are integers, k is incremented by 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1.
Output State: **n, m, s are greater than 0, j+1, k+1, i+1, dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k], dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k] are integers, k is incremented by 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1**
