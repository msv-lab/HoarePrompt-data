According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic for the loop to execute the first time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. So at the start of the next iteration, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic for the loop to execute the next time**.
