According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, which means the loop will not execute. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute**
