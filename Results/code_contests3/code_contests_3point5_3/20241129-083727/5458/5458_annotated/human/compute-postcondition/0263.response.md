Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, and elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is 4. `k` is s.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is 4. `k` is s**
