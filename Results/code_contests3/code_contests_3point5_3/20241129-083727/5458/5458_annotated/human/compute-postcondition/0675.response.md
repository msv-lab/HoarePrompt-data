According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j+1` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `k` should be one more than its previous value, so `k` needs to be incremented. Also, `i` should be reset to 0 for the next iteration. 

Given that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i=0`, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than `m`, `j >= k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**.
