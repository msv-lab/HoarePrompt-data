Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. The values of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished depend on the conditions specified in the loop code. If the loop does not execute, the values of the variables will be the same as the initial state. If the loop executes, the values will be determined based on the conditions and calculations within the loop.**
