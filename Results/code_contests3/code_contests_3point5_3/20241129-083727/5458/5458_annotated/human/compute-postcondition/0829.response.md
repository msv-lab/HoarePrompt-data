According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n**2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed `n` times. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined by the loop conditions and calculations for the next iteration.**
