Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
