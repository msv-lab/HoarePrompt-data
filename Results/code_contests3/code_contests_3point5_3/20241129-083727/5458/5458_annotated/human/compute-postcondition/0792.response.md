Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers. `s` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
