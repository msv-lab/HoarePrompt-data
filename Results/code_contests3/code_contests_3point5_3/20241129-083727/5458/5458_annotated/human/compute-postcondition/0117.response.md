Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, we can only determine that the value of `dp` is shifted to the right by one position in the second dimension. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, elements in `dp` list are updated for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, elements in `dp` list are updated for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
