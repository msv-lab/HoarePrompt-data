Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop condition, the value of `j` changes. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1**
