Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
