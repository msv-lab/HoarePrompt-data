According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. Since `j` is less than `k`, the condition `j >= k` is not met, and the loop will continue. For the next iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.**
