Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 1, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time, if `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is equal to 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j >= k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
