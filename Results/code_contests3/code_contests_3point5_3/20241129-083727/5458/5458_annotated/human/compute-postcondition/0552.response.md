Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated according to the loop logic, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic. If `i` is equal to 0, then the elements `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` where `j >= k` are assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the elements `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated based on the conditions provided in the loop code.**
