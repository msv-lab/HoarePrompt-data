According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a value less than or equal to `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than 0**
