According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j+1`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i=0`, `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod = 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j+1` should be less than `m+1`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i=0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod = 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than `m+1`**
