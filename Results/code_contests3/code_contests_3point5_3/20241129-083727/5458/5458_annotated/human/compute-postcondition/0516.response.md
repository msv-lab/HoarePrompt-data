Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 3`, `s` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than or equal to `m. After the if-else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if i is 0. Otherwise, all the mentioned conditions remain unchanged.***
