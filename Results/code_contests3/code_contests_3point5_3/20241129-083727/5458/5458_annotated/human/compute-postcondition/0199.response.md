Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since no initial values are provided for `i`, `j`, and `k`, the output state will include the assigned value but not specific values for the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
