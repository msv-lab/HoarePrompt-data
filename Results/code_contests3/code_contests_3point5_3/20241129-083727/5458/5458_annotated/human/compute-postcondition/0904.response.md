Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` with the condition that `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` with the condition that `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
