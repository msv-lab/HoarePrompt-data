Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j > k`, there is no change in the state and the program continues execution. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
