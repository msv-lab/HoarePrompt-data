Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to loop logic for the loop to execute the first time. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue to the next iteration or statement in the loop.***
