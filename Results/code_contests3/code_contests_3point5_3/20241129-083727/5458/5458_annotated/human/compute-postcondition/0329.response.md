Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by taking the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with the value of `mod`. The value of `mod` is 100000. All other variables remain unchanged based on the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`**
