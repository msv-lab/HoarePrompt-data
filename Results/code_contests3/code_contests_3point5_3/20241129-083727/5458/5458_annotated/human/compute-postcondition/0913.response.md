Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k=2`, `i` are all integers and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is now equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k=2`, `i` are all integers and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is now equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
