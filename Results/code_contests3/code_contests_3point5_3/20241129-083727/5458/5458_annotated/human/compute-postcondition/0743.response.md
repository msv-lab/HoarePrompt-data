According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` is an integer, `k+1` is incremented by 1, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1.**
