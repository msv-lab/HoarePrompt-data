Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
