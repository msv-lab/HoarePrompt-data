Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the array element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0. The condition `(j >= k)` is true. The array element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
