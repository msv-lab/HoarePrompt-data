Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1. Elements in `dp` list are updated for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Subsequently, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
