Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is `s`, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0`, `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given calculation.**
