Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined by the previous values. The program continues without any changes to the variables.***
