Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `m` and `s` are taken from user input. Since `n` is not used in this code snippet, it does not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are user input integers, and `dp` is a 3D list of zeros with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1).
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list of zeros with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1)**
