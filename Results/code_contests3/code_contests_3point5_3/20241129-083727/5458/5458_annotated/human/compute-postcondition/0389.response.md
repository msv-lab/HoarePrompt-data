Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
