Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since i is 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, and i remains the same, the updated value of `dp` is based on these conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s are at least 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, i remains the same, dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **n, m, s are at least 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, i remains the same, dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. j is greater than or equal to k**
