According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the `dp` list have been updated, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
