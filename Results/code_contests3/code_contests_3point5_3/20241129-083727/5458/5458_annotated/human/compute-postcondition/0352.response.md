According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` should be 1. If `i == 0`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` must be greater than `k`. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 1, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time, if `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than `k`**
