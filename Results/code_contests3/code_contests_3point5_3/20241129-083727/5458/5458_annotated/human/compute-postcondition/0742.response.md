Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. The values of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]` and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated based on the provided code snippet.***
