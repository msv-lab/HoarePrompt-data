According to the code, the loop can execute for the next iteration based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 and `k` should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0.**
