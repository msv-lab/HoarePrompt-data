According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was 2, and it must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. All other variables `n, m, s, j+1, i` remain integers.
State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=3, i` are all integers. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
