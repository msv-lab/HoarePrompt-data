According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 2, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`**.
