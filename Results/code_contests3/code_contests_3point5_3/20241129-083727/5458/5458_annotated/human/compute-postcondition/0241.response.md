Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***
