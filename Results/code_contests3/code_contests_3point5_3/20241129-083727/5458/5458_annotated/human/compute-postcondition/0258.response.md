Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, 3, and s respectively. The bitwise operation `& 1` on `i + 1` results in 0. Therefore, the updated state of `dp` is that the element at index `[0][4][s]` is now 1. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is 3. `k` is s. Element at index `[0][4][s]` in `dp` is now 1.**
