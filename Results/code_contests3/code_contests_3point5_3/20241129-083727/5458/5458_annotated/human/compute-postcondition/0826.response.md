Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. `k` has been incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `j > k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` has been executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1. If i == 0, then the program executes the if part, otherwise, the program executes the else part.***
