Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If j >= k, `dp` remains the same with the updated element at position (1, m + 3, 2) having a value of 1. Otherwise, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
