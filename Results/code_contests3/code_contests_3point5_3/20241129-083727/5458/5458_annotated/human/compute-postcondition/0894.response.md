Postcondition: ***`n, m, s, j, k+1, i` are integers with `n, m, s` being at least 0. `j` has been incremented by 1, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`, and the `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions. In the if part, if i == 0, the `dp` array is updated with the assignment 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] if j >= k. In the else part, the `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions without any specific assignment.***
