According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, s, i` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` array is fully updated based on the loop conditions. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m+1`.
State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=s, i` are integers with `n, m, s` being at least 0, for the loop to execute another time `j` must be less than or equal to `m+1`**
