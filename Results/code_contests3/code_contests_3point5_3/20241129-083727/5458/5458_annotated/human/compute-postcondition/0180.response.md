Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function continues with the incremented `j` and `i` values. Otherwise, the function does not alter any variables and proceeds with the existing values of `j` and `i`.***
