Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[1][2][1] = 1. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After running the code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
