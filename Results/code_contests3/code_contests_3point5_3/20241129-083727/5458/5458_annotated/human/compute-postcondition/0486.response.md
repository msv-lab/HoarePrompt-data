To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
- Update `k` to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `s + 1`.
- Check if the conditions for the loop execution are still met based on the new value of `k` and the existing values of `j`, `m`, `s`, and the `dp` list.

State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if `i == 0`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to have executed at least once with `s` at least 1. If `i != 0`, then for the loop to have executed at least once with `s` at least 1, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` if `j > k`.
