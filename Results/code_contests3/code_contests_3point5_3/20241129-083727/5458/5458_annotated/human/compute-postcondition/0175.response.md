According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j` and `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables remain the same. The loop will update the values in `dp` based on the conditions provided in the loop code. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1**
