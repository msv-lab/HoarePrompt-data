Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
