Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
