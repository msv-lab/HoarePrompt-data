Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly defined, but the modulo operation is applied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` where `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration or proceeds with the next statement.
Output State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` where `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration or proceeds with the next statement.**
