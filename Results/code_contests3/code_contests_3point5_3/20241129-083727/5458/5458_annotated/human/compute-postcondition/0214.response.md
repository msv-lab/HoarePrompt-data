Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 0, j is 1, and k is 1, the new values of the variables are: dp[1][2][1] = 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. dp[1][2][1] = 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. dp[1][2][1] = 1**
