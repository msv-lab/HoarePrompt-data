Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `i` is 0, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value `1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, after the if else block executes, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
