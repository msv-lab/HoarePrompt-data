According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to be equal to `s`. Additionally, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given calculation.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is now equal to `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, `s` is greater than 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
