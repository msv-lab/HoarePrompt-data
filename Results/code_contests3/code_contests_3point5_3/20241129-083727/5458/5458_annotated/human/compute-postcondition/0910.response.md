According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` are all integers, `j` is less than or equal to `m+1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=2, i` are all integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
