Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change in the variables and the loop continues to execute.***
