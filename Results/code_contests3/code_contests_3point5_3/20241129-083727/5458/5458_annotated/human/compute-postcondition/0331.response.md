Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `j` is greater than `k`.***
