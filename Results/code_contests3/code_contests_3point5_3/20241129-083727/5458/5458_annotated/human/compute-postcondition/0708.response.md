According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k+1` is an integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **n, m, s, j+1, k, i, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are all integers.**
