Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Since `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is now greater than `k`, so the if part will be executed. The values of `n, m, s` remain the same, `j` is now incremented by 1, `k` remains 2, `i` remains the same. The `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`n, m, s` are at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains the same, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions**
