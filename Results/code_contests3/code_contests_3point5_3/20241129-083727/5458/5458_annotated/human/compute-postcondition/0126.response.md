Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and based on those values, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
