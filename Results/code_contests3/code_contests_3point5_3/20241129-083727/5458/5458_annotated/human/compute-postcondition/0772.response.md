Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. `s` is greater than 1. `k` is equal to `s + 1`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain the same except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
