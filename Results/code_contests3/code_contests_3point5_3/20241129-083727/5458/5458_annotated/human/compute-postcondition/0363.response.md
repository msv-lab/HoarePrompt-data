Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 1, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than `k`. Additionally, after the if else block executes, `j` remains greater than `k`. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to the result of the modulo operation between the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.**
