Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: *n, m, s are at least 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, i remains the same, dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.
Output State: ***n, m, s are at least 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, i remains the same, dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.***
