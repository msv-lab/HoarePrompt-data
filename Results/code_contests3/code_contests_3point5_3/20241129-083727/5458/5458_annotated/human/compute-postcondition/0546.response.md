Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic, for the loop to execute another time `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic, for the loop to execute another time `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0**
