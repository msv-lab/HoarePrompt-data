Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, 1, and 3 respectively. Since `i + 1` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, and `k` remains 3, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the output state is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
