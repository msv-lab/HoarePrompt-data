Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is `m + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
