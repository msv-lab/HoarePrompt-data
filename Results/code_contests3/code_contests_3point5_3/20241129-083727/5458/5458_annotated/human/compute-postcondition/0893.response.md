Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The initial state does not provide specific values for variables, so the exact values cannot be calculated. The output state after running the code is that the `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions**
