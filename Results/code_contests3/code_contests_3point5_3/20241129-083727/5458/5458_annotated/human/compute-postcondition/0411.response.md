Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is `m + 2`, `j` is `m + 1` or `m + 2`, `k` is updated based on the conditions stated above, `mod` and `n` meet the specified conditions, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0, `j` is also `m + 2`. Otherwise, `j` is `m + 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
