Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation**
