Example Answer:
The value of `k` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1**
