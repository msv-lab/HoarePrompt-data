Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
