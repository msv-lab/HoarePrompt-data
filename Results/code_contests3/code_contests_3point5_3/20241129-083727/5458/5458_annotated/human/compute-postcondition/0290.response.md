According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `m - 1`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. For the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute again, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
