Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i=0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod = 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program variables retain their initial values and relationships as described in the precondition.***
