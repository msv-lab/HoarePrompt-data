Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic, for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
