According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and the range specified in the loop statement. Since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `m` inclusive, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m` indicates that the loop will execute for the last iteration. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should be 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is updated according to the loop logic.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic**
