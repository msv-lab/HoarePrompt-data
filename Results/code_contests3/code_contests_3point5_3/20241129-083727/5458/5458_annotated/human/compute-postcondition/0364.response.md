Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 1, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, if `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than `k`. In the if part, if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In the else part, `j` remains greater than `k` and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to the result of the modulo operation between the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.***
