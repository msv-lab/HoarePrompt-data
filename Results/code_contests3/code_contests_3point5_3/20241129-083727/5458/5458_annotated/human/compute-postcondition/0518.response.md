Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.**
