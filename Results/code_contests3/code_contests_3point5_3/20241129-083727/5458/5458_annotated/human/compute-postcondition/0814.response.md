Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, and `k` has been incremented by 1. If `j > k`, then the program continues with the specified conditions for the variables. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
