According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is an integer, `j+1` is less than `m`, `i` is an integer, and `k` is now one more than its previous value.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than `m`, `k` is one more than its previous value**
