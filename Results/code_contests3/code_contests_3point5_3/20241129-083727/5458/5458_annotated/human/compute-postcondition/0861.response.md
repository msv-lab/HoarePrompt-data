Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k+1]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k+1]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k+1` is 3 for the loop to execute the next time. If `i == 0`, all variables remain the same. If `i != 0`, all variables remain the same except `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the updated value. When `j >= k`, all variables remain the same except `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. All variables are integers after the execution of the if else block.***
