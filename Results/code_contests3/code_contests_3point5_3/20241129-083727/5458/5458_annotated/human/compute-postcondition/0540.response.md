Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to loop logic for the next iteration.
Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to loop logic for the next iteration.**
