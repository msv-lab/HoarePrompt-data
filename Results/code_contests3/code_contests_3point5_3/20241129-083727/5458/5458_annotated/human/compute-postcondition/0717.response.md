According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: *n, m, s, j+1, k+1, i, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are all integers. If i == 0, the program does not modify the variables. If i is not equal to 0, the state of the program variables will be determined based on the initial values of dp, i, j, k, and mod.*
