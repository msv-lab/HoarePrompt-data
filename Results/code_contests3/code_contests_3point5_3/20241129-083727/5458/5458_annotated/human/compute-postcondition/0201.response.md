Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: All variables remain the same, conditions for the next iteration should be evaluated based on the updated `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, conditions for the next iteration should be evaluated based on the updated `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
