According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic**
