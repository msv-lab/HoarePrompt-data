According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, `m` was greater than 1, `k` was 1, `s` was greater than 0. If `i` was equal to 0, and `j` was greater than or equal to `k`, then the program state was such that `j` was greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` was not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, and if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
