According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the values to ensure the loop can execute the first time. 
Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `mod` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `m` remains unchanged
- `s` remains unchanged
- `i` remains unchanged
- `j` needs to be set to 1 for the loop to start
- `k` remains unchanged
- The elements in the `dp` list should be adjusted based on the loop's execution logic for the next iteration

State: **`mod` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `j` is 1, `k` is unchanged, elements in `dp` list adjusted accordingly for the next iteration**
