Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to loop logic for the loop to execute the first time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state, without any changes. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
