According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to s (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Increment the value of `k` by 1.
- Update the value of `dp` at index `[1][m + 2][1]` based on the conditions provided.
- Update the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the conditions provided.
- Update the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` based on the conditions provided.

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2.**
