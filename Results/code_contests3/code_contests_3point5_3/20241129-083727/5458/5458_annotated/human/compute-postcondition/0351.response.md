According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, and the conditions specified for updating `dp` elements. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is `s`, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i == 0`, `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. So, for the loop to execute again, if `i == 0`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `i != 0`, `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given calculation. This means `j` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute again.

State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is `s`, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, if `i == 0`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i != 0`, `j` must be greater than `k`.**
