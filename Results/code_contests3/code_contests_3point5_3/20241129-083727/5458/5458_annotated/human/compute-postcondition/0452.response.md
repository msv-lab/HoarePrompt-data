According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the `dp` list have been updated, `j` has been incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and either `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `i` is not equal to 0**
