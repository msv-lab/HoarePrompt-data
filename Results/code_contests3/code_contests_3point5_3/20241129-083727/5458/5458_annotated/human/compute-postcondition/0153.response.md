Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0**
