Postcondition: ***n, m, s are at least 0, j is incremented by 1, k is 1, i remains the same, dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop. If i is equal to 0, the program variables maintain their initial values and specifications. If j is greater than or equal to k, the program variables still retain their initial values and specifications.***
