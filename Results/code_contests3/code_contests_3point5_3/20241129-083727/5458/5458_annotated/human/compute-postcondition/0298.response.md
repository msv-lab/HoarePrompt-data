Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. After the if statement executes, if `i` is 0, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration without changes. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is not greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
