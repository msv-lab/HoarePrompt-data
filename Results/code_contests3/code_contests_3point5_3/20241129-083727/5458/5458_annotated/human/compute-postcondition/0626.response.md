Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(2, m + 2, s + 1)` where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers assigned from the input. If `n == m == s == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are integers assigned from the input. If `n == m == s == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.**
