Output State: **All variables remain the same, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, all variables remain the same and the function proceeds with the existing values of `j` and `i`.**
