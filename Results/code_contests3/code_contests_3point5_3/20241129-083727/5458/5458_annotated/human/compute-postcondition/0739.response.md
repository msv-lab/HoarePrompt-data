Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. The condition (i == 0) is false. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues with the same variables and conditions as before the if statement.***
