Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged. Elements in the `dp` list are adjusted for the next iteration. Since `j + 1` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the existing conditions. 
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged, elements in `dp` list are adjusted for the next iteration. i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, the program continues with the existing conditions.**
