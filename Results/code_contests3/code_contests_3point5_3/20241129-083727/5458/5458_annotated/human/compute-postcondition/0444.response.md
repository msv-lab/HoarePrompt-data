Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After executing the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration.***
