Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `j`, `k` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated according to the provided formula.
Output State: **`j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated according to the provided formula**
