Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged, elements in `dp` list are adjusted for the next iteration.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged, elements in `dp` list are adjusted for the next iteration**
