Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function reads input, splits it, converts each element to an integer, and maps them to `n`, `m`, and `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the respective integer values from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the respective integer values from the input**
