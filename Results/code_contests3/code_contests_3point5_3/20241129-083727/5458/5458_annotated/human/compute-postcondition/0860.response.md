Example Answer:
The value of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This operation is carried out if `j` is greater than `k`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, `k`, or `mod`, so the output state is:
Output State: **All variables remain integers.**
