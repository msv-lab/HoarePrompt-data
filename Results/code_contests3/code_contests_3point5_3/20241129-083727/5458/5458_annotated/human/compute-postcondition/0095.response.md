Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is determined after the if statement is executed. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
