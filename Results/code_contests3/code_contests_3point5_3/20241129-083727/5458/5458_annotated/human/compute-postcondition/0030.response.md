Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). The state of `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and `j` becomes 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` remains greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. After the if else block executes, the program variables `i` and `j` have been updated accordingly.***
