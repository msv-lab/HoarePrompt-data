According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Since `k` is already set to `s`, the loop will execute. `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, and elements in `dp` list do not affect the loop execution in this case.

State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is s, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
