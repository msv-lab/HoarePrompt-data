Example Answer:
The value of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` remain integers and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` remain integers and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
