Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` remain integers. For the loop to execute `s` still needs to be greater than 0. The condition (i == 0) is still false. j is still greater than k. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues.**
