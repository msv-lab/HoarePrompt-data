Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same. `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, no changes occur.***
