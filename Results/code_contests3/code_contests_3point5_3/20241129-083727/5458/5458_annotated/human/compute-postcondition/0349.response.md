Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0`, the state remains unchanged. If `i != 0`, `j > k`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
