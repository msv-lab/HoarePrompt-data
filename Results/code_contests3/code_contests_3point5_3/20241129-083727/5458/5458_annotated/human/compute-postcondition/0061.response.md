Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
