According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`. Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than `m`**
