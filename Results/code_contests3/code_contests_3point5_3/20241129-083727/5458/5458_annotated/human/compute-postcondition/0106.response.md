Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is equal to `s`. The values in the dp list are calculated based on the conditions in the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being determined by the previous values in the dp list and the modulo operation with `mod`.**
