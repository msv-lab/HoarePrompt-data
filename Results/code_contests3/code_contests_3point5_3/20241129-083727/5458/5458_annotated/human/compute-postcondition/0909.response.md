Postcondition: ***`n, m, s, j+1, k=1, i` are all integers. The loop can execute if `j` is less than or equal to `m+1` and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then the program enters the if condition. After entering the if condition, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program proceeds to the else part. In the else part, for each iteration where `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
