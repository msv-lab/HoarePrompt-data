Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic for the loop to execute the next time. If `i` is equal to 0, then the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1.***
