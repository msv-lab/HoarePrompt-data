Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, elements in `dp` list are updated for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
