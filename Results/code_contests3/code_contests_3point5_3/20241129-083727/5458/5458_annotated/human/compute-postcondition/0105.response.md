Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 2`, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time. If i == 0, then `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If i != 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
