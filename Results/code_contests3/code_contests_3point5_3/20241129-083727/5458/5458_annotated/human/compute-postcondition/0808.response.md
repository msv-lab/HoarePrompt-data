Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j >= k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
