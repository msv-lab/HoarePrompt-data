Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and `n` meet the specified conditions. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
