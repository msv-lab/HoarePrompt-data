Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected. Since we encounter a `continue` statement, we skip the remaining code and move to the next iteration of the loop or the next block of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is incremented by 1 and the loop or block of code continues with the next iteration.
Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1 and the loop or block of code continues with the next iteration**
