Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic, for the loop to execute another time `j` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with the same state. The formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is applied to update the elements in the `dp` list.**
