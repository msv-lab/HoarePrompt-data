Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0. The final values of the variables depend on the conditions inside the loop and the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` at the end of the loop. The loop updates the values of `dp` based on certain conditions and calculations. The final values will be determined by the entire execution of the loop.**
