Output State: **All variables remain the same. `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, after the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `m` is unequal to 0, `k` is 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`**
