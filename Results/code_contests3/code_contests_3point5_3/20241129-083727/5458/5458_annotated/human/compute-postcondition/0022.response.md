According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1). If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
