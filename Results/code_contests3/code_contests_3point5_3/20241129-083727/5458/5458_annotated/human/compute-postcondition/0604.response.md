Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s + 1 and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has taken place. The program continues without changing the values of the variables.**
