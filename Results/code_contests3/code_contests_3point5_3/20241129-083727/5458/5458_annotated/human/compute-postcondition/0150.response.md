Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **All variables remain the same. `j` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
