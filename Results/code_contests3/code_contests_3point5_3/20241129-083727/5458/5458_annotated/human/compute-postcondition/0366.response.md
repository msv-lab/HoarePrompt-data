Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 2, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time, if `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than 2. The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
