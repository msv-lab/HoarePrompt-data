Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m - 1`. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. After the if statement executes, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
