Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, s, j` are at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains the same, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`n, m, s, j` are at least 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `i` remains the same, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions**
