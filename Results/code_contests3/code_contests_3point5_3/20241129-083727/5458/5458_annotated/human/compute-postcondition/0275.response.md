Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0. `j` is `m`. `k` is `s + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
