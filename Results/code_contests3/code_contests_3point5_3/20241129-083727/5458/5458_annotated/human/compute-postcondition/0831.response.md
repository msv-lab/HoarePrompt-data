According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
