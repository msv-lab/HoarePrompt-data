According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is the upper limit for `j`, `i` is 0, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][s]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is s, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m**`.
