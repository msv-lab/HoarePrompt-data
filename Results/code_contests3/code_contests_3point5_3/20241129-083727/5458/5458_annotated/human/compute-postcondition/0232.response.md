Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, elements in `dp` list remain unchanged. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[1][2][1] = 1. Otherwise, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and elements in `dp` list are adjusted for the next iteration. If `i` is 0, the program continues with the same state. If `i` is not 0, the program updates dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
