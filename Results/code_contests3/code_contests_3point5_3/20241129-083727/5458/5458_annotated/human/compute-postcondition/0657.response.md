Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then based on the value of `i`, either `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 or updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`. After executing the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
