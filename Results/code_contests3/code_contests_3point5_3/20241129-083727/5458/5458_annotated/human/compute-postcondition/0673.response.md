Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified based on the previous values. 
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given calculation.**
