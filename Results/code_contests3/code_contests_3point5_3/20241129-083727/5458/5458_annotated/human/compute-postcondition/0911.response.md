Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since there are no other variable updates or calculations, the output state is:
Output State: **`n, m, s, j+1, k=2, i` are all integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
