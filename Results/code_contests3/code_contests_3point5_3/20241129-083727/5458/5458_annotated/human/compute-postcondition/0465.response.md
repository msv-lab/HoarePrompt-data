Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if `i == 0`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute for the first time with `s` at least 1. If `i != 0`, then for the loop to execute for the first time with `s` at least 1, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the modulo of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` if `j > k`.***
