Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than `m` and `k` is one more than its previous value. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
