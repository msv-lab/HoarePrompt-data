According to the code, the loop will execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So the next iteration will have `i+1`. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers**
