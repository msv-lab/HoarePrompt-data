Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` can be calculated based on those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, all elements in `dp` list have been updated, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`**
