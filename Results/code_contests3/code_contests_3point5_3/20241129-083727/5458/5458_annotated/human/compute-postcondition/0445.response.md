Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than 0, and if `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration.**
