Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their initial values are not provided, so the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers. `s` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers. `s` is greater than 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`**
