Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i=0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod = 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`. The loop will update the values of the variables according to the conditions specified in the loop code, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` potentially being set to 1 based on the comparisons made within the loop.**
