Output State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is in the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is updated according to the loop logic for the loop to execute the first time and is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the provided code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.**
