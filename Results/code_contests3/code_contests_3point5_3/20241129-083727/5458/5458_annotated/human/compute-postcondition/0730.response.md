According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are already 1, and `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. So, for the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is assigned the value 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0**
