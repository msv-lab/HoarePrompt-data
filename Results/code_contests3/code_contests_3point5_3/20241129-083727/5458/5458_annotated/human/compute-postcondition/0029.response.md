Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The dimensions of the `dp` list are (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` and `j` are updated based on the conditions specified. The initial state does not change except for the values in the `dp` list being updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` has been updated, `i` and `j` have been updated.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` has been updated, `i` and `j` have been updated**
