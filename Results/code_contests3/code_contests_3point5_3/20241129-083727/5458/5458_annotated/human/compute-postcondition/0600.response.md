According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and become less than or equal to `s`.
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s + 1**
