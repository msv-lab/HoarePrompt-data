Example Answer: 
`dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 based on the conditions mentioned. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is now equal to `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, `s` is greater than 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is now equal to `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers, `s` is greater than 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
