According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted to `k` is 1.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are user input integers, `dp` is a 3D list with dimensions (2, m + 2, s + 1), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1** for the loop to execute the first time.
