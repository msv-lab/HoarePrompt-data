According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers, if `i` is equal to 0 then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than `s`.
