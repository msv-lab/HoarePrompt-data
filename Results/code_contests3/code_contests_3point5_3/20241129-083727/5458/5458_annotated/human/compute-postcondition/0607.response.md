Output State: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute the last time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.
