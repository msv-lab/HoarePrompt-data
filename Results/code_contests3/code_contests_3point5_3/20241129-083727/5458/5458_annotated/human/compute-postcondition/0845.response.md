Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][k+1]`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k+1]` are determined. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k+1` is 2, for the loop to execute the next time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
