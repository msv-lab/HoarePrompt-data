Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is 2, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time, if `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than 2. If `j` > 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.
