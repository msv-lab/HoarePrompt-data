According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` list elements being updated, `j` being `m + 1`, `m` being greater than 1, and `k` being in the range of 1 to `s + 1` are all conditions to be met for the loop to execute. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to be `1` for the loop to start. Additionally, for the loop to execute the last time, `k` should be updated to be `s`. Therefore, the adjusted states are as follows:
State: **All elements in `dp` list have been updated, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s`**
