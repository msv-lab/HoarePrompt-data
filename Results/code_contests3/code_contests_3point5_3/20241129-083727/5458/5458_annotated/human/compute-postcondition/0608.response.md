Postcondition: ***All elements in `dp` list have been updated. `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the last time `k` is `s + 1. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
