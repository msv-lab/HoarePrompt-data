Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1. Elements in `dp` list are updated for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
