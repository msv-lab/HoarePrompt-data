Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints provided in the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to store the number of ways to create a Bingo card and calculates the remainder when divided by 100000. The program iterates through all possible combinations of integers that can be placed on the Bingo card and updates the dp array accordingly. The final result is obtained from the dp array and is printed as output. The program handles all possible cases and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
