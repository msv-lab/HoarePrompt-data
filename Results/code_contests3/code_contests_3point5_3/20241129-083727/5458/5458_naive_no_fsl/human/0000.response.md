Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints provided in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created based on the input parameters N, M, and S. The program iterates through all possible combinations and calculates the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created. The final result is then outputted after taking the modulo 100000.

The program seems to handle all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the integers on the Bingo card are within the specified range, the sum of integers is correct, and the ordering of integers is as required. Therefore, based on the analysis of the code and the problem requirements, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
