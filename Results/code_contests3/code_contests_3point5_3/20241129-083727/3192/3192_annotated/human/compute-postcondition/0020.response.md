According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. Before the loop starts, `j` is 1, so the loop will execute if the first element of `arr1` is greater than or equal to 2. The other states that need adjustment are `temp` which should be set to 1 and `i` should be updated to `arr1[0]`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is 1**
