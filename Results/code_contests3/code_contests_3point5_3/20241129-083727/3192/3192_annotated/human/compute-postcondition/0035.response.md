According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1. 

To execute the loop one more time:
- `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`.
- `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`.
- `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the updated next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1**
