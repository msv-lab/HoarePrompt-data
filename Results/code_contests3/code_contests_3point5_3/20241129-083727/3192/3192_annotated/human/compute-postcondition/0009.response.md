According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr1` and `j`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute the second time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
