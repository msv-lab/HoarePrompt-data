According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
