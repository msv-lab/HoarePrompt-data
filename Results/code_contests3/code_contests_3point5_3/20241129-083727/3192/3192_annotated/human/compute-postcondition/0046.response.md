Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` to its current value. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression**
