Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as the sum of the products of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`. Since the initial state values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `n` are not provided, the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the sum of the products of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the products of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`**
