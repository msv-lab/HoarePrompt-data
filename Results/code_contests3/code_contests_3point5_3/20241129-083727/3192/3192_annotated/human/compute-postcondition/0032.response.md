Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0, but the previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1` and `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1` and `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is 0**
