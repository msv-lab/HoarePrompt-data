Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `i` are not given so we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
