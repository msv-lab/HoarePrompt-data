According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the updated next element in `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be increased by 1, and all other states remain the same.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the updated next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1**
