According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `arr` and `arr2` being empty lists do not affect the execution of the loop. The `maxval` being 0 also does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
