Example Answer:
`maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. Since `i` is initially 0, `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr1`. If `arr[0]` is greater than the current `maxval`, `maxval` will be updated to `arr[0]`. Otherwise, `maxval` will remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`**
