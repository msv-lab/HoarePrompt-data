Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then iterates `n` times to read input values and calculate the maximum values within those inputs. It then calculates a final result `ans` based on the maximum values and their corresponding first elements. Finally, it prints the sum of these calculated values. The function does not accept any parameters or return any value.**
