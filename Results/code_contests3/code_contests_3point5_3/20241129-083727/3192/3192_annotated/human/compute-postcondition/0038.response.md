Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is already the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` remains the same. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the updated next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` remains the same, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the updated next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` remains the same, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1**
