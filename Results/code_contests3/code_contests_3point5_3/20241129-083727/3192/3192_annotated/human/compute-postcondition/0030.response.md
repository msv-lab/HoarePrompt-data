According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is increased by 1 until it reaches `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1` and `n` should be checked to ensure `i` is less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1` and `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`**
