Example Answer:
`ans` is updated based on the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not defined in the initial state. The value of `i` is 2, which means `arr[i]` and `arr2[i]` are indexed at 2. Since the values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not given, we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
