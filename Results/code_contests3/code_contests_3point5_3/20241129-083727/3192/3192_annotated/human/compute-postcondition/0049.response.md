According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the given expression, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
