According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, for the loop to execute another time `j` is increased by 1**
