Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1, `arr` contains the appended value of `temp`.**
