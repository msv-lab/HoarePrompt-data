According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Since the loop is going to execute the second time, `j` will be increased by 1, so `j` will become 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` should be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute the third time `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 3**
