According to the code, the loop can execute if arr1[0] is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the loop will execute at least once if arr1[0] is greater than 1. The initial state needs to be adjusted so that arr1[0] is greater than 1 and j is set to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
