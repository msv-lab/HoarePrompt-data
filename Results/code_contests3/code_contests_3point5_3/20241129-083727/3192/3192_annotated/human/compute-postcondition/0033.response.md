According to the code, the loop will execute if the range specified by `xrange(1, arr1[0])` is valid. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr1[0]` should be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is the next element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr1`, `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input split, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` should be greater than 1**
