According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` should be 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers after splitting, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1**.
