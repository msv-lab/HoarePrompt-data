Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is the sum of all `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each iteration of the loop.**
