According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the current value of `i` which is 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`**
