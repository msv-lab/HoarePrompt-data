Example Answer:
The code creates a new empty list called `arr2`, but it does not affect the existing variables `n`, `arr`, and `maxval`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
