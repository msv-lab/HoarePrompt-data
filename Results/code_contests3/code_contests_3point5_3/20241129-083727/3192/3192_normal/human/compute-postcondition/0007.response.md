According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer ensures the loop can execute. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 1. So the states that need to be adjusted are: `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
