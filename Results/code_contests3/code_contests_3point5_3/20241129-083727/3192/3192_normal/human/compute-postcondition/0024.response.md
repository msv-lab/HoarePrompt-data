According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `j` and the list `arr1`. If `i` is less than `n+1` and `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 3, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2**
