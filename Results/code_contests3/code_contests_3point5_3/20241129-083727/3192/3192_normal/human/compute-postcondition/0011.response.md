According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. In the loop, `j` is increased by 1 so for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than the first element of `arr1`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value of `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the first element of `arr1`**
