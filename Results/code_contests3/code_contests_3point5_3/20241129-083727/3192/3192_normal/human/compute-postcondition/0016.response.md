Example Answer:
The value of `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element at index `i` in `arr1` and the current value of `maxval`. The previous values of `maxval`, `arr1`, `i`, and `j` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`**
