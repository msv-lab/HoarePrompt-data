According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Before the loop starts, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `arr1[0]`. Since `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, it needs to be modified to be less than `arr1[0]`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `n+2`, `temp` is 0, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`**
