Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `n+2`, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be `j+1**
