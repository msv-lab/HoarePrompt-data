According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Thus, the next iteration of the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1`**
