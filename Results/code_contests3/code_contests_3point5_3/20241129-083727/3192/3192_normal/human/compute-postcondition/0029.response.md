Example Answer:
`maxval` is updated with the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The value of `i` is `n+1`, so `arr[n+1]` is compared with `maxval`. The value of `maxval` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain the same. The value of `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`. After the comparison, `arr` appends `temp` and `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `n+1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `n+1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`**
