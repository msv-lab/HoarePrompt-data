According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer does not ensure the loop will execute. Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2.
