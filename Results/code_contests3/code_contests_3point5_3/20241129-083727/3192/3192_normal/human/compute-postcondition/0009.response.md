According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, and `j` should still be less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute the second time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2**
