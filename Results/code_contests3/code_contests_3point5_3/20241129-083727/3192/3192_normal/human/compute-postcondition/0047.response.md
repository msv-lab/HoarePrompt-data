According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 0, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1**
