Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`, and `arr` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`**
