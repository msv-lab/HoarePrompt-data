According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n+1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `n+2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is `n+2`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user, `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `arr` appends `temp`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1**`.
