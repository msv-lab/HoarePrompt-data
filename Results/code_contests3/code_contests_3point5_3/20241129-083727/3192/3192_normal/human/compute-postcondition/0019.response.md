Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on the comparison, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered by the user**
