According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1` entered by the user, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` entered by the user, `i` is equal to 0, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
