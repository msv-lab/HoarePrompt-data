According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list and `arr2` is also an empty list. The `maxval` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
