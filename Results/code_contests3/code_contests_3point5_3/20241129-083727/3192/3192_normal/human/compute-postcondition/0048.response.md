Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The loop must execute one more time, so `n` should be greater than 1. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1**
