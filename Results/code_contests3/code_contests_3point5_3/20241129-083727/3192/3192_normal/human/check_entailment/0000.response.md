Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly and calculates the minimal total salary increase required to merge all companies as per the problem description.
- It iterates through each company, calculates the maximum salary in each company, finds the maximum salary across all companies, and then calculates the total salary increase needed based on the difference between the maximum salary in each company and the overall maximum salary.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the owners can merge the companies while following the rules and minimizing the total salary increase.
