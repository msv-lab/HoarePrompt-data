The function `func` reads input about a conglomerate's structure, including the number of companies, the number of employees in each company, and their salaries. It calculates a value 'ans' based on the maximum salaries in each company and the number of employees in each company. The function then prints the final value of 'ans'. The function does not return any value but is used for analyzing conglomerate data.
