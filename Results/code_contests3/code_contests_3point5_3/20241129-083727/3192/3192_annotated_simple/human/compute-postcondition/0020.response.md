According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value at index 0 of arr1. If the value is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers input by the user, `temp` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1[0]` is at least 1 and j is 1.
