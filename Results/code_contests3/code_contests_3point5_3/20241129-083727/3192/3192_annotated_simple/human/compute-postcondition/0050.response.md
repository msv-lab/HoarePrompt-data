Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Since the loop is executing for the third time, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. Therefore, the value of `ans` is further updated based on the provided formula. 
Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is updated according to the formula, for the third loop execution `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, `ans` is further updated by the formula.**
