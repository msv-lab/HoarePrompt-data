Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the previous value of `maxval`. The initial state of `arr` and `arr1` is not provided, so the exact values of `arr[i]` and `maxval` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, and `maxval` is updated based on the comparison.
Output State: **`arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison**
