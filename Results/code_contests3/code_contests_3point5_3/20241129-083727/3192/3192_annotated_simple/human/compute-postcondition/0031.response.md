Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the user and assigns it to the list `arr1`. The values of other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison of all elements in `arr1`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the updated `i` for the loop to execute, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i+1`.
Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison of all elements in `arr1`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the updated `i` for the loop to execute, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i+1`**
