According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were:
- `arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it
- `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`
- `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`
- `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`
- For the loop to execute the second time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is 1
- `ans` is further updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`

To execute the loop one more time:
- Since `i` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` should remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute the third time `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, `ans` is further updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]**.
