Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, where `arr1[j]` is not defined in the initial state. The loop executes the second time with `j` being 2. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the value of `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
