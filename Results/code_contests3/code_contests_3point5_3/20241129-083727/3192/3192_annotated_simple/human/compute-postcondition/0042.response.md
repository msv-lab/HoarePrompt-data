Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the existing maximum value `maxval`. The initial state indicates that `temp` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, so `maxval` is either equal to `temp` or the current element in `arr1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr` contains the value stored in `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the updated maximum value based on the comparison.
Output State: **`temp` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr` contains the value stored in `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` contains the updated maximum value based on the comparison**
