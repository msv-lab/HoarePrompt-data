Example Answer:
n is assigned the value of the input received from the user. Since the input is taken with `raw_input()`, it is stored as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of companies. Each company is described by the number of employees (m_i) and their salaries, where m_i is a positive integer and the salaries are positive integers not exceeding 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
