According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it and `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `maxval` should be the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is 0, and `i` is 0. 
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
