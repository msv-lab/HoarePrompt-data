According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 and `j` must be 3.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
