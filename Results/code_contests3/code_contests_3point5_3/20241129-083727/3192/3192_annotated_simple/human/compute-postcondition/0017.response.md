According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison. So for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`**
