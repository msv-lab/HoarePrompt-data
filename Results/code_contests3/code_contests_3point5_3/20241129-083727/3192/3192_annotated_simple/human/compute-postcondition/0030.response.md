According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the updated `i` for the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison of all elements in `arr1`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the updated `i` for the loop to execute, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers input by the user, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i+1`.**
