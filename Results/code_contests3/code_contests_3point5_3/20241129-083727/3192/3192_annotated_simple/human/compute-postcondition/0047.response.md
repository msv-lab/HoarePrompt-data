According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `i` should be 1.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1**
