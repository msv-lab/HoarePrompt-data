According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` is now 1.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
