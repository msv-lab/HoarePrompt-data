According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value at index 0 of `arr1` which should be at least 1. The loop will execute for `arr1[0] - 1` times. 

Based on the provided information, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison of all elements in `arr1`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the updated `arr1[0]` for the loop to execute, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `arr1[0]`, `temp` is assigned the value 0, `j` starts from 1 and iterates up to `arr1[0] - 1`**
