Functionality: **The function reads the number of companies `n`, each described by the number of employees and their salaries. It then calculates the maximum salary among employees in each company, stores it in `arr`, and the number of employees in each company in `arr2`. It finds the maximum salary across all companies in `maxval`. Finally, it calculates and prints the average salary across all companies by summing `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each company.**
