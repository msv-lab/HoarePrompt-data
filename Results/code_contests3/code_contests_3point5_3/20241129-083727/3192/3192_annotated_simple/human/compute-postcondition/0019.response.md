Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the variables are: `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers input by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers input by the user, `temp` is 0.
Output State: **`arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers input by the user, `temp` is 0**
