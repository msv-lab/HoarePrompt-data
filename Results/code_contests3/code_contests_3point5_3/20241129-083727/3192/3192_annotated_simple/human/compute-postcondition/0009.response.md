According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. Therefore, `j` should be updated to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
