Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated based on the initial state. `ans` is the summation of each `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for every element in `arr`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, and the value of `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, and the value of `ans` is printed**
