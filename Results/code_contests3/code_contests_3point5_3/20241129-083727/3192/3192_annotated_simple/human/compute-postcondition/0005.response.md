Example Answer:
`arr1` is assigned the list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. The values in `arr1` are based on user input, so the exact values are unknown. `arr` remains an empty list, `maxval` stays at 0, `arr2` remains an empty list, and `n` is still greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0**
