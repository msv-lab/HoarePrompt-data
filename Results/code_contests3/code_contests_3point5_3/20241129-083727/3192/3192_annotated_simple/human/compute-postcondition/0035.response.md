According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j` and `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `arr1[0]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to equal `arr1[0]`.
State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated based on comparison of all elements in `arr1`, `i` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than the updated `arr1[0]` for the loop to execute, `temp` contains the maximum value from `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `arr1[0]`, `temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is now equal to `arr1[0]`.**
