Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`. Since the initial state is not provided for `arr1` and `arr2`, we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`.
Output State: **`arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it, `arr2` appends the value at index 0 of `arr1`**
