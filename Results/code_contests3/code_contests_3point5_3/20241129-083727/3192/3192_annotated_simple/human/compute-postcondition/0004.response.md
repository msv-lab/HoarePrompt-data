According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the list `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, and the list `arr2` is empty. To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
