Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[n]`, and `arr1[0]` is greater than `n`, so the value of `temp` remains the same. Therefore, after execution, `arr` will contain the value of `temp` appended to it.
Output State: **`arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to it**
