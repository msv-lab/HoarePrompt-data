Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the first element of `arr1` to it. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `temp` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr` contains the value stored in `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`temp` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr` contains the value stored in `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
