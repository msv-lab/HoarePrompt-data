Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum value from each `arr1` appended to it, `arr2` contains the value at index 0 of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, `ans` is further updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`**
