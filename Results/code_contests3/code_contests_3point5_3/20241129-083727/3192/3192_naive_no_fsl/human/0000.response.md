Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input as described in the problem statement, calculates the maximum salary in each company, and then computes the total minimal increase needed to merge all companies. The logic used in the program is correct and follows the rules mentioned in the problem description. The program iterates through each company, calculates the maximum salary, and then computes the increase needed to make it equal to the maximum salary among all companies. Finally, it sums up all the increases to get the total minimal increase required. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
