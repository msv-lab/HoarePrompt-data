The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The function then calculates the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times n and dividing it by the sine of pi divided by 2 times n. Finally, the function returns this calculated result. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199, calculate the specified mathematical expression, and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199, calculates the specified mathematical expression, and returns the result.**
