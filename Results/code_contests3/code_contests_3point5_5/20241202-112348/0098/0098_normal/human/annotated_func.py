#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.**
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of applying the cosine of pi divided by 4 times n and dividing it by the sine of pi divided by 2 times n, where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199, calculates the specified mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions, and returns the result. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations.
