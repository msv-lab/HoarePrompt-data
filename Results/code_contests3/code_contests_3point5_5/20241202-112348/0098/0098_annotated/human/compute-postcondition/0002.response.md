Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199 and calculates the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on n. **

Potential Edge Cases:
- The function may encounter a ZeroDivisionError if n is such that the denominators in the expressions become zero.
- If n is not an odd integer or falls outside the range of 3 to 199, the function may not behave as expected.
