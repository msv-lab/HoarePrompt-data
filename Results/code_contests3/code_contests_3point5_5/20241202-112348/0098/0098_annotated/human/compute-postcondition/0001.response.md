The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer `n` between 3 and 199. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine based on `n`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199 and returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on n.**
