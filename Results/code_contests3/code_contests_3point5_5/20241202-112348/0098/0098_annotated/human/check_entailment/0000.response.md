Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in, based on the input odd integer n between 3 and 199. The formula used in the program to calculate this minimum length is in line with the problem description, which involves the cosine and sine of specific angles based on n. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
