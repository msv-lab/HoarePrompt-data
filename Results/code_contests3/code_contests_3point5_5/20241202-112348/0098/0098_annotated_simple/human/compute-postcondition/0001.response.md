The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The function calculates the result of the cosine of pi divided by (4 times n) divided by the sine of pi divided by (2 times n) and returns this result. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and return the calculated result based on the given formula. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, an odd integer between 3 and 199, and returns the result of the specified mathematical calculation.**
