Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199. It calculates the result of the cosine of pi divided by (4 times n) divided by the sine of pi divided by (2 times n) and returns this value. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an even integer or falls outside the specified range (3 to 199).**
