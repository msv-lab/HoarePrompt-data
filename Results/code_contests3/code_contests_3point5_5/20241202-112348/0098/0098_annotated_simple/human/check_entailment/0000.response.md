Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in, based on the provided problem description. The formula used in the program matches the mathematical formula described in the problem. The function correctly calculates the result using the cosine and sine functions with the given input `n`, which is an odd integer between 3 and 199. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and returns the correct result for all potential cases.
