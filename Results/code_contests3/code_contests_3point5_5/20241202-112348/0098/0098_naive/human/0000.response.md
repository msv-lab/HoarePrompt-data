Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in. It uses the formula cos(pi / (4 * n)) / sin(pi / (2 * n)) to calculate this value. The program handles all potential cases for odd integers n within the given constraints. Since the formula is mathematically correct and the program implements it accurately, the program is correct.
