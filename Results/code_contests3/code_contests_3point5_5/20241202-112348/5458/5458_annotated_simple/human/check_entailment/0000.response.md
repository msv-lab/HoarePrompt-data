Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions for each dataset. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to create a Bingo card that meets the specified conditions, and then outputs the remainder when divided by 100,000. The program iterates through all possible combinations of integers on the Bingo card and correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
