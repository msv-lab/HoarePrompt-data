The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all are 0. It then performs calculations using dynamic programming to fill a 3D array `dp` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints a specific value from the `dp` array. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
