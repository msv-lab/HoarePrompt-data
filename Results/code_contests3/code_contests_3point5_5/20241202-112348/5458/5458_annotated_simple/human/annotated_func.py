    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After all iterations, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `i` are positive integers incremented by the total number of iterations. The final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations that have been executed. The dp array will have specific values assigned to dp[n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all are 0. It then performs calculations using dynamic programming to fill a 3D array `dp` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints a specific value from the `dp` array. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
