According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m + 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is 5, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 10**
