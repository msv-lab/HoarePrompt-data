According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `S` inclusive. The variables that need to be adjusted are `k` which should be set to 1 to start the loop and `S` which should be greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1**
