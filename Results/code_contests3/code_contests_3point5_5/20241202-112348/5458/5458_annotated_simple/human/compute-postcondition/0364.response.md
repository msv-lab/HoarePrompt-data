Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` remain the same. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
