Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: *`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged**
