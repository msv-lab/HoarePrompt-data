Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` is a positive integer, `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`, `dp` array is updated accordingly. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s` and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.***
