Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables are integers incremented by 2, the new values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain the same as the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 2. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`.
Output State: **All variables `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 2. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
