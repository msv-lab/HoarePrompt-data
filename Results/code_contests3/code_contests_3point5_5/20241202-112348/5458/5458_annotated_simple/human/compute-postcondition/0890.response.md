Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, and j are increased by the total number of iterations of the loop. K is 3, s is greater than or equal to 1, j is 1. If i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, if i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
