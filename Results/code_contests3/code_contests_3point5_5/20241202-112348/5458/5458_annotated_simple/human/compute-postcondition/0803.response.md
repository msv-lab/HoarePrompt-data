Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. The values of i, j, and k are updated based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is not equal to 0. j is s+2, k is 1 to s. j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is not equal to 0. j is s+2, k is 1 to s. j is greater than k**.
