According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables must be adjusted as follows for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. After the execution of the if else block, if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables and the program continues without any alterations. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`. After the execution of the if else block, if `j >= k+1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is assigned the value 1.**
