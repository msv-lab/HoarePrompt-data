According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is s+1, `k` is s+1. Since `j` is s+1, it is less than `m+1`, so the loop can execute one more time.

State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is 0, j is s+2, k is s+1.**
