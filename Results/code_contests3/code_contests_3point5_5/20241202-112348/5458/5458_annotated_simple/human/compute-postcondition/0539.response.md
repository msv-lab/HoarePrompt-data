Postcondition: ***`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues with its execution.***
