Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3` for the loop to execute one more time, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3` for the loop to execute one more time, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k**.
