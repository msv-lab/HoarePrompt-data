Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by the total number of iterations, `s` is retained, and specific `dp` values are updated according to the conditions within the loop. Otherwise, all variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement, except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated based on the provided calculations.***
