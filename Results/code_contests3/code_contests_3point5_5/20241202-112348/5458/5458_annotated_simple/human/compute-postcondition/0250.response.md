Postcondition: ***All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations including the next one, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0. Moreover, `j` is greater than `k`***
