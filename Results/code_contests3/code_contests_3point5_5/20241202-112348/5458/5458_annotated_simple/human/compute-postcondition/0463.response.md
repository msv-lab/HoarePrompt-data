Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `j` is equal to `s+2`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` remain positive integers, `j` is no longer less than `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` needs to be increased by 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Moreover, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will not execute.
