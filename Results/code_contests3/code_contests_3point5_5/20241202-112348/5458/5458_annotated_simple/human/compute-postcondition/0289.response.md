Postcondition: ***`i, N, M, S, mod, m, j` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 4, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp array at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables have been updated based on the calculations described in the else part.***
