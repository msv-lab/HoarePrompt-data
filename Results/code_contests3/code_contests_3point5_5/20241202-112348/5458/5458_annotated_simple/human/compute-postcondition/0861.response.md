Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, k` are all increased by 1. If `i` is 0, and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the else condition. In the else part, after the execution, if `j > k` and `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the else condition, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
