Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `N, M, S, mod, m, s, i + 1` remain unchanged, and for the loop to execute one more time, j is between 1 and m inclusive, k is between 1 and s inclusive, and i is not equal to 0, the output state remains the same for those variables. The only change is in the `dp` matrix where the mentioned assignment takes place.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i + 1, dp matrix remain unchanged, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
