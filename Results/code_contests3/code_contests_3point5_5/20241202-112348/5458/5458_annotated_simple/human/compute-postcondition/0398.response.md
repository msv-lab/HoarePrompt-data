According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is 15. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1 but must be less than or equal to `s`, so `k` becomes 2. 
State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is 2, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
