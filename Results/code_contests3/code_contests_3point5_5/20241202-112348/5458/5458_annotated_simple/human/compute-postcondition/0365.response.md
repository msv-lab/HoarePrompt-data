According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and remain less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`**
