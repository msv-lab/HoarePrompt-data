Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**
