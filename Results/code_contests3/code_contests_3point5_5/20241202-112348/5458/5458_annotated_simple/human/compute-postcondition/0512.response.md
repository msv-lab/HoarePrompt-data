Output State: At the end of the if else block, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are incremented by 1. `s` is a positive integer. `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. `dp` array is updated accordingly. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1. Now, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program executes the `continue` statement to skip the remaining code in the loop and move to the next iteration without changing any other variables.
