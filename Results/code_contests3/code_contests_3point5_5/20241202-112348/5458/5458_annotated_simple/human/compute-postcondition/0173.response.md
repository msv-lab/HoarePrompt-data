Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s`, `dp` values are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
