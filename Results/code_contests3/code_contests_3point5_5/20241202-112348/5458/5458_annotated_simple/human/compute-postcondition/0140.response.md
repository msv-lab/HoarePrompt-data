Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are all integers. If `i == 0`, then `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` are initialized to specific values, `s` is determined based on loop conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, then `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` are set to 1, `k` is updated to `k + 2`, and `s` is determined based on loop conditions.***
