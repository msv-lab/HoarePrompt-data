Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` is 1, `k + 2`, `s` is determined based on loop conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` is 1, `k + 2`, `s` is determined based on loop conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
