Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `i` is 0, after execution, `i + 1 & 1` will be 1, and `j + 1` will be 2. The value of `k` is not specified, but the value of `mod` is necessary to calculate the output state accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. If j > k, then we continue to the next iteration. `dp[1][2][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[0][j][k]` modulo `mod`.
