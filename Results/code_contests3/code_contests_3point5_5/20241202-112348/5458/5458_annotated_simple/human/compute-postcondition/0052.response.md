Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation**
