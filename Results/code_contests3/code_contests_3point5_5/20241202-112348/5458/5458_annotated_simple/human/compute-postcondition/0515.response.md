Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, `mod`, and other variables are unknown, so the output state is: All variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is assigned a new value.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is assigned a new value**
