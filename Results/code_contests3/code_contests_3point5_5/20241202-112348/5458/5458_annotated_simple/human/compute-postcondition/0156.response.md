According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a value within the range of 1 to s. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s`, `dp` values need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time**
