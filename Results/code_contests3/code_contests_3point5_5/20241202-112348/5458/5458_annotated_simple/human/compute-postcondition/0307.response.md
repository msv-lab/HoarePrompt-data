Postcondition: ***`i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 6, `s` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the third time. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and the program proceeds to the next iteration or process.***
