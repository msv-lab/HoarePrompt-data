According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` needs to be greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **All variables i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 1, the values of dp are updated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations that have been executed, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
