Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Since no initial values are given for N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1, and i is 0, we cannot calculate the specific values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly updated based on the given formula.**
