Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute, and the value of `i` is 0. Moreover, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
