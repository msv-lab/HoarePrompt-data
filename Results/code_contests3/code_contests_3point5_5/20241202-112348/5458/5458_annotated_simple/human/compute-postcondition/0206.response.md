Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 2. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged as `j` is greater than `k`.***
