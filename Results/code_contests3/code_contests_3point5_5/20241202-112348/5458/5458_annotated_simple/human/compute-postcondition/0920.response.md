Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The code assigns 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the value of `j` has been increased by 1, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i remain the same; j is increased by 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i remain the same; j is increased by 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
