According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, to ensure that the loop can execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`, `k` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, and for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**.
