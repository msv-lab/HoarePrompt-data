Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, k` remain unchanged. The condition `j > k` is not met, so the calculation is performed. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is either 0 or not, k is less than s. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the calculation dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
