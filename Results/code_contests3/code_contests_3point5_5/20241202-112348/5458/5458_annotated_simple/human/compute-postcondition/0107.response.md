Output State: **At the end of the loop, `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are all integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The final state will depend on the specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and other variables at the start of the loop.**
