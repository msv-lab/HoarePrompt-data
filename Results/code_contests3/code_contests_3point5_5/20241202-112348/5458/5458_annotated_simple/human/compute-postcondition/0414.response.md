Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is updated value based on the range condition, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition where if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
