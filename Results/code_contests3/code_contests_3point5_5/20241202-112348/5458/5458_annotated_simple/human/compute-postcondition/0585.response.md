Output State: **N, M, S, mod, k, s, i, dp array values are integers. If i == 0, M is greater than or equal to 2, j will be either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1` after the next iteration, and j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not equal to 0, M must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute. The values in the dp array will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being calculated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
