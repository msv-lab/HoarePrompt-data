Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, where mod is the modulus. The calculation involves taking the modulus of the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] before adding it to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly**
