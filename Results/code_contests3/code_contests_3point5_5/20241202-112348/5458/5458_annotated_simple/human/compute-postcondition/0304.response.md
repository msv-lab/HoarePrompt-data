Postcondition: ***`i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 6. `s` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the third time. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or process.***
