Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The variables N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. The variables i and k are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is either 0 or not, k is less than s.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is either 0 or not, k is less than s**
