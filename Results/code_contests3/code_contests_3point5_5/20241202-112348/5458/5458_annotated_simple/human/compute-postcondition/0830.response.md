According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. The state before the loop starts does not guarantee that the loop will execute another time, so `j` needs to be adjusted to be 1 greater than its previous value to ensure the loop will run again.

State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is increased by 1, for the loop to execute another time j is increased by 1**
