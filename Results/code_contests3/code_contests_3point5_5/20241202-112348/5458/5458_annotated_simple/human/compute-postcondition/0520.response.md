According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated based on the current value of `i` to ensure it is either `s+2` or `s+3`, and `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` are positive integers, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3`, `j` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
