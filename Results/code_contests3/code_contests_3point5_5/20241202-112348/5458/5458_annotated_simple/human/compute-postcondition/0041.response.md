According to the given code snippet, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `j` should be incremented by 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be updated to 2.

State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is between 1 and S, and the values in the dp array will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop code**.
