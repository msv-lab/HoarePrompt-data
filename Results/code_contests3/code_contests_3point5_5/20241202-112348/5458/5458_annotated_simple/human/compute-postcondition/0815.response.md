Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is either 0 or not. If i is 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k is less than s + 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.**
