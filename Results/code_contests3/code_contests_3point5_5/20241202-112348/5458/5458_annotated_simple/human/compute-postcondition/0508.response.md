According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **At the end of the if else block, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are incremented by 1. `s` is a positive integer. `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. `dp` array is updated accordingly. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.**
