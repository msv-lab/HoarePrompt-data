Postcondition: ***All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 4. If `i == 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod` and `k` is incremented by 1. If `i != 0`, the variables are incremented by 5 and the same conditions apply for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on `j` and `k`, with the additional step of updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
