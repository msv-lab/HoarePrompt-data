According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be less than 10 for the loop to execute one more time. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` is now 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is 1, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 10**
