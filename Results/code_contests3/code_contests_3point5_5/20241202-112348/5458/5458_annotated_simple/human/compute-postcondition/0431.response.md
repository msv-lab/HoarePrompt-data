Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation. As `j < k`, the updated `dp` values are performed accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: updated values of `dp` based on the calculation.
Output State: **updated values of `dp` based on the calculation**
