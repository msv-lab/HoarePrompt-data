Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s` are at least 1. `i`, `dp` array values are adjusted accordingly. For the loop to execute one more time `k` is now equal to the next value in the range (current value + 1). If `i` is equal to 0, then the program state is as described. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
