Output State: **`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is 15, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the final result after all iterations of the loop. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` must be less than 10. The final result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions and assignments within the loop.**
