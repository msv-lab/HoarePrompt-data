Postcondition: ***`i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 5, `s` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the second time. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
