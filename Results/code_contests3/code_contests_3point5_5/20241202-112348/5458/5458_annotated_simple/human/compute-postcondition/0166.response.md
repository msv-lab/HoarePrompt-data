Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s`, `dp` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s`, `dp` values are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s`, `dp` values are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
