Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, k, s, i, dp array values are integers. If i == 0, M is greater than or equal to 2, j will be either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1` after the next iteration, and j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not equal to 0, M must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If j > k after the execution of the if else block, the program's state remains unchanged.***
