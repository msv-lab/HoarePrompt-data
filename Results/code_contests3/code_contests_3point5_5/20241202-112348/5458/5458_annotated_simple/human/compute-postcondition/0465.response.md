Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `j` is equal to `s+2`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` remain positive integers. `j` is no longer less than `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` needs to be increased by 1. Additionally, `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0, then after the if condition (`j >= k`), `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, then if `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will not execute.***
