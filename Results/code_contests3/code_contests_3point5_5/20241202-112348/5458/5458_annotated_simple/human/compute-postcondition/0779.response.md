Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
