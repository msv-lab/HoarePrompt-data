Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, and k are increased by the total number of iterations of the loop. The final state of dp matrix depends on the conditions within the loop and the values of i, j, and k at the end of the loop execution. `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0.***
