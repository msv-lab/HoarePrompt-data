Output State: After the execution of the if else block, N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, K are increased by the total number of iterations of the loop. If i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to K, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][K] is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, if i is not equal to 0 and j > K, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][K] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][K] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][K] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][K - j] % mod.
