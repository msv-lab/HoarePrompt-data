Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unclear, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i remain the same. j is increased by 1 if j > k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i remain the same. j is increased by 1 if j > k**.
