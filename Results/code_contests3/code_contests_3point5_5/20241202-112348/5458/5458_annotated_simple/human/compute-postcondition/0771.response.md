Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is 0, j is 1, for the loop to execute s is greater than or equal to 1. i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
