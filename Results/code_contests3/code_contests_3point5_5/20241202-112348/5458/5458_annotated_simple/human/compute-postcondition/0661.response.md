According to the code, the loop can execute for values of j starting from 1 up to and including m. At the end of the last iteration, N, M, S, mod, m, j are integers. k is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is 0, and dp is correctly initialized with zeros. To execute the loop one more time, j should be incremented by 1. 
State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1 are integers. k is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is 0, and dp is correctly initialized with zeros**
