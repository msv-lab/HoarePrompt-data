Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are determined based on loop conditions, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is met, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
