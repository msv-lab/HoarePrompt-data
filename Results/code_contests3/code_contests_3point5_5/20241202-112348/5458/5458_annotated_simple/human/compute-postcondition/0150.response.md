Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and other variables remain the same. Since the calculation is based on the previous values, the output state is:
Output State: **i is 2, N is 2, M is 2, S is greater than or equal to 1, mod is 2, m is 2, j is 2, k is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, dp values are updated according to the conditions within the loop, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
