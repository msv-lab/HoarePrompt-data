Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, and k are increased by the total number of iterations of the loop. The final state of the dp matrix depends on the conditions within the loop and the values of i, j, and k at the end of the loop execution. If i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, if i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. In addition to the above conditions, if the else part executes, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][K] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][K - j] % mod.***
