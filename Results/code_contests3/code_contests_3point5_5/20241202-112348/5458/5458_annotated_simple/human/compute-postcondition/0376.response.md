Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0 and `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables and the program continues without any alterations. For the next iteration, `k` is incremented by 1.***
