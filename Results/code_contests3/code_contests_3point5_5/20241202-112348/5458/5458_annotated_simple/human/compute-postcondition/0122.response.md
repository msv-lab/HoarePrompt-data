Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` are determined based on loop conditions. `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When the if condition (j >= k) is met, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
