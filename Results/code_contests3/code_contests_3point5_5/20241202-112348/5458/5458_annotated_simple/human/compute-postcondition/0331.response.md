Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `k`, `s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations, and `dp` values are calculated based on conditions within the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program retains the stated initial conditions and variables. If `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
