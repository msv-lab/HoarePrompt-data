According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the loop, `j` is equal to `s+2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **At the end of the loop, `j` is equal to `s+2`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` remain positive integers, `j` is no longer less than `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`, `k` needs to be increased by 1**
