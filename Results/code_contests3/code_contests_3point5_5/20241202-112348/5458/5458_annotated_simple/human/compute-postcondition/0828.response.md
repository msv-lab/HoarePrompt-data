Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. The final values of i, j, k, s are unknown as they depend on the initial values and the number of iterations of the loop. The dp matrix will be fully calculated based on the conditions within the loop, resulting in the final state of the dp matrix with updated values.**
