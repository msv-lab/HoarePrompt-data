Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change, but the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions within the loop as described, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the conditions within the loop as described, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
