Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, and the rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, j is 1, k is increased by 2, s is at least 1, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros based on dimensions calculated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
