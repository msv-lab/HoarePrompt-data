Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, and `k`, the general calculation results in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s are integers. i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the next time k is updated to a value greater than the current value and less than or equal to s.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s are integers. i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the next time k is updated to a value greater than the current value and less than or equal to s**
