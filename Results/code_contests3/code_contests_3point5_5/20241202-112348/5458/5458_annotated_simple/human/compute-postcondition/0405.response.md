Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod. Therefore, after execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the calculation**
