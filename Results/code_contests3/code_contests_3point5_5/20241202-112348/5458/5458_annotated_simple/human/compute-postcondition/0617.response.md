Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, if i == 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i + 1`, `dp`, `j + 1`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time.***
