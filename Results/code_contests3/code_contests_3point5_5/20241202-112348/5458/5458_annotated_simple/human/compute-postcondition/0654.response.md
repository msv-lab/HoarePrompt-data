Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j are integers. k is increased by 1. s is at least 1. i is 0. dp is correctly initialized with zeros based on dimensions calculated. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] if i == 0, otherwise dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k must be less than or equal to s+1**
