Output State: **`i, N, M, S, mod, m, j` are incremented by the total number of iterations + 3, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
