Output State: **`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
