Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers incremented by 1. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. Otherwise, the loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`, `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k + 1`. In the else part (if any), `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.***
