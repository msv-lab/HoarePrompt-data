Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i, j, k are increased by 1. If i is equal to 0 and j >= k, dp matrix at position [1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
