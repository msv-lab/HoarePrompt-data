Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial states of the variables are as follows:
N, M, S, mod, m, s remain unchanged.
i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s remain unchanged. i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.**
