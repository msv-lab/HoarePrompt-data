Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known, so the modulo operation is performed accordingly. 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i`, `dp` are at least 1. `k` is equal to the next value in the range (current value + 1). `i` is not equal to 0.**
