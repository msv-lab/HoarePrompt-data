Postcondition: ***`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In the else part, all variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
