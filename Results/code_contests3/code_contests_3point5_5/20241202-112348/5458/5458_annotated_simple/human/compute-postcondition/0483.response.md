Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `j` is equal to `s+4` if `i == 0` or `s+5` if `i != 0`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all increased by 1, `s` remains a positive integer. `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, and based on the value of `i`, `j` is adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. If `j > k`, no variable changes occur, and the loop continues with the next iteration.***
