Output State: **At the end of the if statement, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` are positive integers, `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. Elements in the `dp` array are updated accordingly, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
