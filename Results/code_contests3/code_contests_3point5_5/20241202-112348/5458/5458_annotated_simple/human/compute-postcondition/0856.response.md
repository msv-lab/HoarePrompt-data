Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` is also increased by 1, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if-else block, `N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, k` are all increased by 1. If i is 0, and j >= k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the else condition.
