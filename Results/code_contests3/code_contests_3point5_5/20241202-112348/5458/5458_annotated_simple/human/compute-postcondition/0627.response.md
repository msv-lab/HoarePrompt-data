According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is squared, the loop will execute `n` squared times. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `i` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros based on the dimensions calculated, if `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all zero, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
