Example Answer:
The value of dp at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of dp at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros**
