Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, and k remain the same, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If i is equal to 0 and j >= k, dp matrix at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, j is increased by 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
