Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. No other variables are directly affected if `j` > `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time.**
