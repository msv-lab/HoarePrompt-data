Output State: **All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 3, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j > k`, the variables are updated and we continue to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
