Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The variables N, M, S, mod, m, s, and dp matrix remain unchanged. The values of i, j, and k are updated according to the given conditions. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is not equal to 0. j is s+2, k is 1 to s. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.**
