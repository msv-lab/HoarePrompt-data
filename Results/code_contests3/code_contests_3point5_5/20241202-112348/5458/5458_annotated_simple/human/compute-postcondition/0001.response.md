Since the `while` loop condition is `while 1`, which is essentially a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute one time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
