According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, the states remain the same as the end of the previous iteration.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `i` will still be positive integers and the `dp` values will be calculated based on the conditions within the loop.**
