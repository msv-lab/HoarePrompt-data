According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s`, which means the loop executed `s` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to `s + 1`.
State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers. If j >= k, i is updated to 1 and dp is updated with a new value. If j < k, i remains 0 and dp is correctly updated based on the given formula, for the loop to execute another time `k` should be s + 1**
