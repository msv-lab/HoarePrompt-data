Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, j is between 1 and m inclusive, k is between 1 and s inclusive. If i is equal to 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
