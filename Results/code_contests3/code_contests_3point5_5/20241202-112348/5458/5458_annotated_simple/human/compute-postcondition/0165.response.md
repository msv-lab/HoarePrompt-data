According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. If `j` is greater than `k`, then for the loop to execute one more time, the `k+1` value needs to be updated to `k+2`.
State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+2`, `s`, `dp` values are adjusted for the loop to execute one more time**
