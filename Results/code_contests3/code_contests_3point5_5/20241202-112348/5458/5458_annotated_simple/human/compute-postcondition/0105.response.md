Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the values remain the same as per the precondition. If `i` equals 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a new value. In the else part, if `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and after execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
