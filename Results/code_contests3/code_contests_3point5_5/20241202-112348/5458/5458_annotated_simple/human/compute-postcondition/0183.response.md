Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` remain the same as they are not affected by this assignment. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `S`, and `i` should not be equal to 0. Also, `j` should be greater than `k`. 
Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are all incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than or equal to `S`. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.**
