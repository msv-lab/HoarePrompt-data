Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 3, the affected variables are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 3, `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 3, `k` is less than or equal to `s**.
