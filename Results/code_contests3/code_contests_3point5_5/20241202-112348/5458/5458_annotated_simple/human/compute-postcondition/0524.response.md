Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given as 0, `s+2` or `s+3`, and `k` respectively, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is updated to either `s+2` or `s+3` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
