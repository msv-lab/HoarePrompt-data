Example Answer:
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The values of variables remain the same as described. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is either 0 or not, k is less than s. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the calculation dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
