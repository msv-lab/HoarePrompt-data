Output State: **`j`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, `dp` values are updated, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than `s` and `j` should be greater than `k`**
