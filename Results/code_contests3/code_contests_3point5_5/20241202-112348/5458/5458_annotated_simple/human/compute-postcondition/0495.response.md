Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` are positive integers, `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. Elements in the `dp` array are updated accordingly, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. No variables are changed when `j > k`, the loop or if statement continues without any alterations.***
