Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial values of i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s, and dp are provided, and the condition `j > k` is met. The output state reflects the updated `dp` values based on the given conditions.
Output State: **Updated dp values based on the conditions within the loop**
