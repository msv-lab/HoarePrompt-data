Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. After the execution of the if else block, if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues without any other changes. The variable `k` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**
