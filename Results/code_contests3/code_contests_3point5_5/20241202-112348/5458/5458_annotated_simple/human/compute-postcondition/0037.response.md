Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, for the loop to execute the third time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
