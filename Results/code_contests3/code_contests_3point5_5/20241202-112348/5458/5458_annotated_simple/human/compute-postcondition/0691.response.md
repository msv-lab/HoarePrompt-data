Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s are integers. i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 or j <= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If j > k, the loop will execute with k updated to a value greater than the current value and less than or equal to s, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be updated accordingly.**
