Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k, s are integers. k is at least 1, s is at least 1, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time k is 1, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After running the provided code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
