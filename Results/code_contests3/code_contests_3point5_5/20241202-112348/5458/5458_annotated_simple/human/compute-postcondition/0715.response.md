Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specifically provided, so the output state is: N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly updated based on the given formula**
