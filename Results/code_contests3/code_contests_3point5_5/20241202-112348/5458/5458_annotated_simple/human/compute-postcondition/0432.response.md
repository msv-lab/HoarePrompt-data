Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, `dp` values are updated. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The updated values of `dp` are based on the calculation***
