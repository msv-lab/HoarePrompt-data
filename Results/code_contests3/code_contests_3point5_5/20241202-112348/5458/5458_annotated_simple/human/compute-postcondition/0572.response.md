Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, k+1, s, i, dp array values are integers. If i == 0, M is greater than or equal to 2, j will be either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1` after the next iteration, and j is greater than or equal to k+1. If i is not equal to 0, M must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If j > k after the execution of the if block, the program's state remains unchanged. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] has been assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
