Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, for the loop to execute the second time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, for the loop to execute the second time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
