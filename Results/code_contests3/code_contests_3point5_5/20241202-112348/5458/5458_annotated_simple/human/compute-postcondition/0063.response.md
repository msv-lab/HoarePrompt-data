Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0, `dp[1][3][2]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
