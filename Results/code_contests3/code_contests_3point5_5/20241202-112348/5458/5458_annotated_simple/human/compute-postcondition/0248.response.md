Postcondition: ***All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations including the next one, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
