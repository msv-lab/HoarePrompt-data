Postcondition: ***At the end of the if else block, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all incremented by 1. `s` remains a positive integer. `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. The `dp` array is updated accordingly. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1. Additionally, if i == 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, a new value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
