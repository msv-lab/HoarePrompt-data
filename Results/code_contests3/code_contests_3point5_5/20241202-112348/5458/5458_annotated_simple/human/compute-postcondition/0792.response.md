Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. If j > k, then if i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i == 0 and j < k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k should be incremented by 1. After executing the given code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.**
