Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s` are at least 1. `i`, `dp` array values are adjusted accordingly. For the loop to execute one more time `k` is now equal to the next value in the range (current value + 1). If `i` is equal to 0, then the program state is as described. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program state is as described. `k` is equal to the next value in the range (current value + 1). The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
