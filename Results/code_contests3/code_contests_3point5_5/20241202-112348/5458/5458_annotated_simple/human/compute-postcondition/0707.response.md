Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros. For the loop to execute one more time, k is now s+1 and j is j+1. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to 1. If i == 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], updated to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and then incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod***
