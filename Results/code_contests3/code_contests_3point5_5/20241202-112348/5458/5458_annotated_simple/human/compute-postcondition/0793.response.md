Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. If i == 0, j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1, and k is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If i == 0, j < k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. After executing the given code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.***
