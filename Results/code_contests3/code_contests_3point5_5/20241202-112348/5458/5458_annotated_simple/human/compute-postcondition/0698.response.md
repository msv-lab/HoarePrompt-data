Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 0, the index becomes 1 & 1 which equals 1. j is incremented by 1, so j+1 increases. The value of k remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s are integers, i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros. For the loop to execute one more time, k is now s+1 and j is j+1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to 1.
