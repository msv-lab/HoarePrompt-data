Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The value of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by the total number of iterations, `s` is retained, specific `dp` values are updated according to the conditions within the loop.
