Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k+1, s+1 are integers. If j >= k, i is updated to 1 and dp is updated with a new value. If j < k, i remains 0 and dp is correctly updated based on the given formula, for the loop to execute another time k should be s + 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
