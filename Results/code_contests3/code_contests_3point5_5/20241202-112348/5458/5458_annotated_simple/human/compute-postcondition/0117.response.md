Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are determined based on loop conditions, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are determined based on loop conditions, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
