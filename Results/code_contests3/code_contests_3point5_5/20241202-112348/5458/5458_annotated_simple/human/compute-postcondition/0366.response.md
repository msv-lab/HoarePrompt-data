Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables involved in this assignment are `i`, `j`, and `k`. As their initial values are not specified, the output state will include the assignment of 1 to the specific element in the `dp` array.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
