Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, update `dp` values. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is 2, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, update `dp` values. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `j` is greater than `k`**
