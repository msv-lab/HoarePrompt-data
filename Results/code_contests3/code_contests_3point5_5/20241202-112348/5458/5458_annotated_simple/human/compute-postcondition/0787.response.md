Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 and k is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If j < k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
