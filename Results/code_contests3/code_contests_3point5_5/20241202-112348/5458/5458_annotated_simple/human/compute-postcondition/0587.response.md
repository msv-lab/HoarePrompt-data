According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Since the loop is using `xrange(1, s + 1)`, the loop will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s` is at least 1, `i`, `dp` array values are adjusted accordingly, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is now equal to the next value in the range (current value + 1)**
