Postcondition: ***All variables `i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations including the next one, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its previous value.***
