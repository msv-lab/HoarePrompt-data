Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` is 1, `k + 1`, `s` are determined based on loop conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1 if the condition (j >= k) is met. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod` when `j > k`.**
