According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute, `j` should be incremented by 1 and remain less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the state before the loop, it should be adjusted to `j` is 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
