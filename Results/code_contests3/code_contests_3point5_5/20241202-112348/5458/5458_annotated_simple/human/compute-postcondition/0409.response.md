Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is updated based on the range condition, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes the given assignments and condition updates.***
