Postcondition: ***All variables i, N, M, S, mod, m, j, k, s are integers incremented by the total number of iterations + 1, the values of dp are updated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations that have been executed, `m` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables remain the same as they were incremented by the total number of iterations + 1, and the values of dp are updated based on the condition within the loop for all executed iterations.***
