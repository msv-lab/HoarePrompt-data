Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, j, and k would have been increased by the total number of iterations of the loop. The final state of dp matrix will be dependent on the conditions within the loop and the values of i, j, and k at the end of the loop execution.**
