Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i, and k remain the same. j is increased by 1. If j >= k, dp matrix at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. If j > k, dp matrix at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the value of dp matrix at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
