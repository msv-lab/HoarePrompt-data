Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by the total number of iterations + 1, `s` is retained, and specific `dp` values are updated according to the conditions within the loop. Otherwise, all variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement, except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` which is updated to 1 when `j >= k`.***
