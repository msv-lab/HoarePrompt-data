According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i` equals 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` remain integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the updated value.**
