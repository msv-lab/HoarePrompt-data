Postcondition: ***All variables (`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `j`, `i`) are integers with the initial values of 1, except `s` which is greater than or equal to 1, `j` which is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, and `i` which is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`***
