Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged, `j` is greater than `k`**
