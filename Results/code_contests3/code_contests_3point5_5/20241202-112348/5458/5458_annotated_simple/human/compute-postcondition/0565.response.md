Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. The loop will execute one more time only if `M` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j > k`, the program's state remains the same.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, k, s` are integers, `i` is a non-zero integer, `dp` array values are updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be greater than or equal to 2. After the execution of the if else block, if `j > k`, the program's state remains unchanged.**
