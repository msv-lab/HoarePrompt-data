Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is 0, j is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1. If j >= k, dp[1][2][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Finally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
