Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are variables determined by loop conditions. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are determined based on loop conditions, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
