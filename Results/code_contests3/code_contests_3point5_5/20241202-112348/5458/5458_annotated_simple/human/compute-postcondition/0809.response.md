According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is either 0 or not. If i is 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`.
