Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The affected variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod**.
