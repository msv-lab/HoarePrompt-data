Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `j` is equal to `s+2` if `i == 0` or `s+3` if `i != 0`, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is increased by 1, `s` remains a positive integer. `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, and based on the value of `i`, `j` is adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i == 0`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
