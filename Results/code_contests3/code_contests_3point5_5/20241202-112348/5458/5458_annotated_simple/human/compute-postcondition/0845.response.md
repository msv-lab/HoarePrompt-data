Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i, j, k` are incremented by 1, the new values used in the assignment are `i + 1, j + 1, k`. Therefore, the output state is: `N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i, j, k` are increased by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i, j, k` are increased by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
