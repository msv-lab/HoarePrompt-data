Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, j+1, k, s are integers. i is 0, dp is correctly initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time k is 1. If i == 0, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 when j >= k. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly based on the logic of the else part.***
