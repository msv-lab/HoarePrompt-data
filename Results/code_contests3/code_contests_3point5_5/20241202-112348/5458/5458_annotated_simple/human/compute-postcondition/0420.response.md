According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `j` is 1, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `j` should be incremented by 1 and if `j < k`, then update `dp` values.

State: **`j` is 2, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, update `dp` values**
