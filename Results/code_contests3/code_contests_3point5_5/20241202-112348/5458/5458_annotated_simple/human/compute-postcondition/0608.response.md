Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `s`, `i`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are adjusted accordingly based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
