Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and then it is added the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement, except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated based on the provided calculations.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement, except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated based on the provided calculations.**
