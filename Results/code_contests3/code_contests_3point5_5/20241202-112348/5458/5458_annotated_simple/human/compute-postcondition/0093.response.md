Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` > `k`, then `i` remains 0, `N` remains between 1 and 7, `M` remains between 1 and 2000, `S` remains between 1 and 3000, `mod` remains 100000, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` remains 3, `k` remains 2, `S` remains greater than or equal to 1, `j` remains greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1***
