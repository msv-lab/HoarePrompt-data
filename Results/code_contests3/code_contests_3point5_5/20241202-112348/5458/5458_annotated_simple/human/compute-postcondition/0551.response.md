Postcondition: ***All variables remain integers with initial values; `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. If `i == 0`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is now 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
