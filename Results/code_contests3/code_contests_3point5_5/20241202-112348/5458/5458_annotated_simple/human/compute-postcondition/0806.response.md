Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of N, M, S, mod, m, s, and the dp matrix remain unchanged. The value of i is not equal to 0. Initially, j is set to s+2 and k is set to 1 to s. If j is greater than k, the program continues to the next iteration. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged. i is not equal to 0. j is s+2, k is 1 to s. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration.**
