Postcondition: ***`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `dp` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by the total number of iterations + 1, `s` is retained, and specific `dp` values are updated according to the conditions within the loop. Otherwise, all variables remain the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to 1. If `j < k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
