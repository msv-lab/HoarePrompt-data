According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s+1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, k needs to be incremented by 1. In addition, since j is required to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that.

State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is increased by 1, for the loop to execute another time j is increased by 1, k is increased by 1**
