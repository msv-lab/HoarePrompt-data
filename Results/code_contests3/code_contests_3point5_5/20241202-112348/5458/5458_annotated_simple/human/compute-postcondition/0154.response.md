Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `dp` variables are determined by the conditions within the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated dp values based on the conditions within the loop.
Output State: **Updated dp values based on the conditions within the loop**
