Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, but based on the constraints provided, the output state can be deduced as follows:
Output State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k+1`, `s` are positive integers less than or equal to `m`. `s` is greater than 0, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`.**
