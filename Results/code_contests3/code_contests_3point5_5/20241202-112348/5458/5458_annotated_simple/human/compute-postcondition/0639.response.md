Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, j is 1, k is adjusted based on the range, s is at least 1, dp is correctly initialized with zeros based on dimensions calculated, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by mod**
