Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `dp` matrix remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 while maintaining the conditions. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
