Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `mod` is the modulus operator. Since there are no changes in the variables `j` and `k`, and the program continues without any alterations, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **No changes in the variables as `j` is greater than `k`, and the program continues without any alterations.**
