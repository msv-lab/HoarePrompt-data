According to the code, the loop can execute for each `k` value from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be considered.
State: **`m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are all 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.**
