Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers, `j` is 1, `k`, `s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations, and `dp` values are calculated based on conditions within the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program retains the stated initial conditions and variables.***
