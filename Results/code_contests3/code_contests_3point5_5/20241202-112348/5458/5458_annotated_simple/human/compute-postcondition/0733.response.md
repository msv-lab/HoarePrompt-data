Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. Since i is 0, j is between 1 and m inclusive, and k is between 1 and s inclusive, the dp matrix is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i + 1, dp matrix remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time, j is between 1 and m inclusive, k is between 1 and s inclusive. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1**
