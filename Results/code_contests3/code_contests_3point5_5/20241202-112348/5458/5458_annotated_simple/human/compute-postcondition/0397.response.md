Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `N` is 5, `M` is 10, `S` is 20, `mod` is 1000000007, `m` is 10, `j` is 11, `k` is 1, `s` is 15, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` must be less than 10. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
