According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and `j` is less than `k`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s` and `j` should still be less than `k`.
State: **`j` is 2, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `j < k`, `dp` values are updated, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be less than `s` and `j` needs to be less than `k`.**
