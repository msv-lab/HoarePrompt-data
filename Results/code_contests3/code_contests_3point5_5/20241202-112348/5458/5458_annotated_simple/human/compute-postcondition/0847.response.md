Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` have all been increased by 1 before this operation. Therefore, after execution, the `dp` matrix remains unchanged, `i`, `j`, and `k` have been further increased by 1.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i, j, k` have all been increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
