According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `k`, `s`, and the `dp matrix`. 
At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same except `j`, which is increased by 1. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the new `j` must be less than `k`. 
State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix, i remain the same. j is increased by 1.**
