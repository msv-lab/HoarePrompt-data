According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is the upper limit. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j` is 2, `k` is determined based on the loop conditions, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` values are updated according to the conditions within the loop**
