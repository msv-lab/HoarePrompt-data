Output State: **`i` is 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k`, `s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations, `dp` values are calculated based on conditions within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
