Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, dp matrix remain unchanged, i is increased by 1, j is increased by 1, k is increased by 1. i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is also incremented by the result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
