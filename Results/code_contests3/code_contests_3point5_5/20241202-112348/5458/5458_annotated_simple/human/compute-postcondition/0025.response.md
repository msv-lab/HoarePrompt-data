Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The current values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, 1, and `s + 1` respectively. Therefore, after execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `N` is between 1 and 7, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `S` is between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, for the loop to execute the second time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
