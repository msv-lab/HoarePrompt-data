Output State: **All variables remain integers incremented by 1. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`, `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.**
