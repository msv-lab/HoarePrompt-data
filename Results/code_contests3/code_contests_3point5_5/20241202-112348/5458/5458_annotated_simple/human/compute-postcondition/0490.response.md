Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `k`, and `s` are positive integers, `j` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and is less than or equal to `m`. Elements in the `dp` array are updated accordingly. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. When `i` equals 0, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
