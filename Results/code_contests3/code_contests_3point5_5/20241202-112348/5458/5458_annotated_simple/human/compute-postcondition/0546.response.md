The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state values of `m`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, and `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either `s+3+1` or `s+4+1`, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1, the only affected variable is `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
