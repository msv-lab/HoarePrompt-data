According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range 1 to m inclusive. Before the loop starts, the values of N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, dp matrix should remain unchanged. Since i will be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted to reflect that change.

State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, dp matrix remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time, j is between 1 and m inclusive, i is incremented by 1**
