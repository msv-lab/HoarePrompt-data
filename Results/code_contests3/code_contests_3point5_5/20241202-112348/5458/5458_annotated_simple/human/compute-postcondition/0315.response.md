Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers incremented by the total number of iterations and the final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
