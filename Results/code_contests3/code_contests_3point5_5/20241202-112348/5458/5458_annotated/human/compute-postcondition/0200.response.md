Postcondition: ***`mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 4, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 3, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program maintains the mentioned state.***
