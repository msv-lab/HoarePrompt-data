Example Answer:
The values of the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
