Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, if `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`.***
