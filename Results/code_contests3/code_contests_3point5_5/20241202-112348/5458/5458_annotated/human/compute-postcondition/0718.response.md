Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
