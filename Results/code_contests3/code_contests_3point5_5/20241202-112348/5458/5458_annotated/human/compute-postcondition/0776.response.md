According to the code snippet, the loop can execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. 

Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to the next value. Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute `s` is at least 1**
