Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `m`, `n`, `s`, and `k` remain the same. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now `j + 1`. The value of `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part, which is not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part**
