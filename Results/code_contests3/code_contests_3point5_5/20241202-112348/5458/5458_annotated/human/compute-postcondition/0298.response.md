Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the dp array is updated based on the given formula. If `i` is 0, then the value of `dp[1][m + 2][s]` remains 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
