Example Answer:
The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is increased by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range. The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, and `k` is incremented to the next value in the range.**
