According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as the initial state. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s` remain the same as the initial state**
