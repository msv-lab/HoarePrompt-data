Postcondition: ***mod is m + 2, n is s, m is i + 1, s is greater than 0, j is 2, i is not equal to 0, dp is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, j is less than or equal to m, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks. No changes occur in the variables if j is greater than k, and the program moves to the next iteration or statement.***
