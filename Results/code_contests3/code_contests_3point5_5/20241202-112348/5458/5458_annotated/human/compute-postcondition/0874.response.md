Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod` are known, so the calculation can be made based on those values. 
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs+1, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
