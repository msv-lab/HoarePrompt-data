Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m has an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1, k is 3, s is equal to or greater than 1. If j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If j is greater than k, the program continues to the next iteration and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. If i == 0, the postcondition remains the same. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same.***
