Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. At least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0. `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, after the if statement executes, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. Otherwise, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
