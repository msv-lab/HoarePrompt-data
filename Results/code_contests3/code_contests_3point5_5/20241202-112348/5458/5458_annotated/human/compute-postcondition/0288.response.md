Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The previous values of i, j, k, m, and dp are not provided, so the output state is: k is equal to s, s is greater than or equal to 1, j is equal to m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, and the dp array is updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **k is equal to s, s is greater than or equal to 1, j is equal to m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, dp array is updated based on the given formula**
