Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute again `s` is at least 1. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**.
