Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program remains in the same state without any changes. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***
