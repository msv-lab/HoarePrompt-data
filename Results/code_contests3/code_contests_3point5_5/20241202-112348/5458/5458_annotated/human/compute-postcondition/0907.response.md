Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Given that all the variables are integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, the modulo operation is calculated based on the previous values. 
Output State: **At the end of all iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and the specific modulo operation is performed as described.**
