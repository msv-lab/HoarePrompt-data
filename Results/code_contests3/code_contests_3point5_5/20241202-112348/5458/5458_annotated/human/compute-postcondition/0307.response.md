Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = (dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j]) % mod`***
