Example Answer:
The value at index [n] remains the same. The value of j is increased by 1. The operation dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod is performed. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is calculated based on the previous values of i, j, k, and mod. The variables m and s are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1, k is 2, s is equal to or greater than 1. If j is greater than k, the program continues to the next iteration.
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1, k is 2, s is equal to or greater than 1. If j is greater than k, the program continues to the next iteration.**
