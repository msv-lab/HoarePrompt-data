Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by adding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
