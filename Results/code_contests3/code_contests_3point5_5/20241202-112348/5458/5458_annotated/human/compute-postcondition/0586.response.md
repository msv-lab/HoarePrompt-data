According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain as integers. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1`.
State: **After all iterations, the values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain as integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1**
