Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. However, the initial states of the variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `dp` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output state. Therefore, the Output State is: The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is dependent on the initial conditions of the variables.
Output State: **The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is dependent on the initial conditions of the variables.**
