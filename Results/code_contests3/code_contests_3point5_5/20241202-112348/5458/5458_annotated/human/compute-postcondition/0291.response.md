Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 2` which is `j + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`, after execution, `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `s + 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s + 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1**
