Example Answer:
The equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` after the execution. The value of `k` may be increased by 1 based on the condition `j` > `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s` remain unchanged, `k` may be increased by 1 based on the condition `j` > `k`, and the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s` remain unchanged, `k` may be increased by 1 based on the condition `j` > `k`, and the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
