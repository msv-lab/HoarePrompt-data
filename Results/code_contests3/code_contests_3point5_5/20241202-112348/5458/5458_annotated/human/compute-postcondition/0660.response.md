Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` where `k` ranges from 1 to `s` will be 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not 0, then the value of `dp` will be updated based on the formula provided. The values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
