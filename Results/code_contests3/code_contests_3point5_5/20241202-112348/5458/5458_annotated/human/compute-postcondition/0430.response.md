Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` where `mod` is a constant value. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m` and `j` is less than `k`. After execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, and the loop continues.**
