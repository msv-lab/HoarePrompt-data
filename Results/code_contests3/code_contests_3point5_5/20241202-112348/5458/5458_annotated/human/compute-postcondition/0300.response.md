Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. As per the initial state, `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` will be 0. `j` is `m + 2`, and `m` is not defined in the initial state, so `j` remains `m + 2`. `k` is `s + 2`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, so `k` remains `s + 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1**
