Example Answer:
The value at index `[n]` remains the same. `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is increased by 2. The additional condition states that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The code calculates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index `[n]` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, and the additional condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **The value at index `[n]` remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, and the additional condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
