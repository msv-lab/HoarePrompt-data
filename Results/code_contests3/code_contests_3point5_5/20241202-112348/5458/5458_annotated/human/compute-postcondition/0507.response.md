Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop conditions. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, no changes occur in the variables, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.***
