According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `k` should be incremented by 1
- `s` should remain greater than or equal to 1
- `j` should be incremented by 1
- `i` should remain equal to 0

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the following state adjustments are needed:
State: **`k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0**
