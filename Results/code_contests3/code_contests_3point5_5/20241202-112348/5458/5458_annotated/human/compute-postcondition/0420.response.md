According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s. Therefore, the loop will execute if s is at least 1. Before the loop starts, m is at least 1, i is less than n, and j is the next value to be considered in the range of 1 to m. To adjust the state before the loop starts, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value to be considered in the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute s is at least 1**
