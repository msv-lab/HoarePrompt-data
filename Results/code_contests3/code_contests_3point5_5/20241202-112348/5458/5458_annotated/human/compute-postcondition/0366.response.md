Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but `k` is mentioned to be increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the updated state is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s` are as described, `k` is increased by 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to 1.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s` are as described, `k` is increased by 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
