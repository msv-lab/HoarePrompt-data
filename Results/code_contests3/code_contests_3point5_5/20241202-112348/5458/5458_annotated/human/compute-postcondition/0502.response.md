Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop body conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop body conditions, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
