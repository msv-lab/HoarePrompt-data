Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2. If `i == 0`, the assignment of 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] has been completed if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i != 0`, the output state is not fully determined due to dependencies on the `dp` array elements and `mod` value.***
