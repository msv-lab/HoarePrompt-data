Output State: **The value at index `[n` remains the same, no adjustments needed for the loop to execute again, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values, where the dimensions are `(m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2)`.**
