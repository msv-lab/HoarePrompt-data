Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if else block, if `i == 0`, then `i` is set to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition is satisfied. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
