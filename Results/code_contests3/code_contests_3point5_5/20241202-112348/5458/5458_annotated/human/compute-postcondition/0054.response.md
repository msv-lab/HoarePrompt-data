Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop without changing any of the current variable states.***
