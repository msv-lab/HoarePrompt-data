Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, `k` is adjusted by increasing it by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `k`. In the else part, no changes occur in the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the mentioned calculation.***
