According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, it is known that `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
