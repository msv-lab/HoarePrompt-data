Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of variables `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: updated values of `s`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` based on the conditions.
Output State: **updated values of `s`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` based on the conditions**
