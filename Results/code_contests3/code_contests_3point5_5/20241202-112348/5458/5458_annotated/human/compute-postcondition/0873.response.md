Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs+1, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
