Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same. `j` is incremented by 1. `i` is updated based on the else condition. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be within the range of 1 to `s`. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k']` where `k'` is the original value of `k`.***
