Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, s is equal to or greater than 1. If i is equal to 0, then after the if else block executes, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not equal to 0, the program will execute the if block if j > k and j is greater than k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
