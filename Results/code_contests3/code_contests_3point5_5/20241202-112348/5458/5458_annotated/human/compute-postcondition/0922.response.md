Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are integers. After execution, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied.
Output State: **At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied**
