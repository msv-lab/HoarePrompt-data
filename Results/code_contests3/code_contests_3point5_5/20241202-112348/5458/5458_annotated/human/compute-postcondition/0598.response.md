Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain as integers, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is now `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, updated `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` value.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain as integers, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is now `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, updated `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` value**
