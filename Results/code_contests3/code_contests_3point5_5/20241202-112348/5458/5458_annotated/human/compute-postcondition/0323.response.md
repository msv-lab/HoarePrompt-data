Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the updated element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1 after the execution of the if statement.***
