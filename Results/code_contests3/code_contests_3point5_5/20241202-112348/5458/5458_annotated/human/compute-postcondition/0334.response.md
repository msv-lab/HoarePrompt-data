Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0, the element at index `[0][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[0][j][k] % mod`***
