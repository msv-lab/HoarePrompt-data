According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1. Also, the `dp` 2D list initialization with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2` means that `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
