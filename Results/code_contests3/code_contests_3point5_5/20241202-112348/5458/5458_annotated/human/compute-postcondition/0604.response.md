Example Answer:
The `continue` statement is encountered, which skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop will continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part and the loop continues to the next iteration**
