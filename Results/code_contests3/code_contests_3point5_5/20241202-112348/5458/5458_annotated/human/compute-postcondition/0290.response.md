According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. So, for the next iteration, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the dp array is updated based on the given formula.**
