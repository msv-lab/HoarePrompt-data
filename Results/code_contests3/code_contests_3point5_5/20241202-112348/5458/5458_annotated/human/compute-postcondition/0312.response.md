According to the code, since it is a `while True` loop, it will execute indefinitely until there is a `break` statement inside the loop body. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one more time. No states need to be adjusted.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is `m + n`, the result of the calculation is printed after taking modulus with `mod`**
