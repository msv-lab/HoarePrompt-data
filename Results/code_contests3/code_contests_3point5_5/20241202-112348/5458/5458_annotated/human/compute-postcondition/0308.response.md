Output State: **At the end of the loop, `k` will be equal to `s + s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][m + 2][s]` will be assigned as 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[1][m + 2][s]` will be updated based on the given formula.**
