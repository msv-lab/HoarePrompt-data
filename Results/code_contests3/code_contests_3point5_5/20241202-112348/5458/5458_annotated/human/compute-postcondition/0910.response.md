According to the code, the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` remains greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `k` needs to be updated. Since `k` is being iterated over in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than the current value of `s`.
State: **At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be less than the current value of `s`**
