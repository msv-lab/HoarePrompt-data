Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m` are as described. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` remains the same. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. The final values of the variables will depend on the specific conditions met during the loop iterations.**
