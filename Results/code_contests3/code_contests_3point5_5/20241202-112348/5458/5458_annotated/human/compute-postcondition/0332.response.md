According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0, the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod**.
