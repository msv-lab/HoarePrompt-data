Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop body conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.***
