Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
