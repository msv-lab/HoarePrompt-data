According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if `m` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. If the loop is to execute one more time, the value of `m` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition of the for loop.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1**.
