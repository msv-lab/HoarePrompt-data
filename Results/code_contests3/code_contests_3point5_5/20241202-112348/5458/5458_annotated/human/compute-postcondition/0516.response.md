Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1. `n`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop conditions. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The output state of the program after the if-else block execution cannot be determined accurately without specific initial values of the variables.***
