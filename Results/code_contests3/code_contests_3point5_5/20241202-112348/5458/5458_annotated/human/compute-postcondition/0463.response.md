Example Answer:
The value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of the value at position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged as the condition `j` greater than `k` is not met. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain integers.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain integers**
