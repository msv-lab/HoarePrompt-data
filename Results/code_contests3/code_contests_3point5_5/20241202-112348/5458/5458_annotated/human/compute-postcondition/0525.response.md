Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `j >= k`, then `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0 when the if condition is met, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
