Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
