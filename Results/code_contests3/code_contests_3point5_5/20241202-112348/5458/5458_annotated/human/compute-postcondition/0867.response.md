Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs + 1, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is true, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
