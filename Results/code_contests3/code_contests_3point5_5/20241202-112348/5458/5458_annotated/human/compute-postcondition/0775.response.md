Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` array is updated with the value 1 at index `[1][3][1]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod***
