Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same, and the elements in `dp` are updated based on the given assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, and the assignment operation is performed as described.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.**
