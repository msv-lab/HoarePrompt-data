According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times, and the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `(n ** 2) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1**
