Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. If `j >= k`, then if `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either assigned 1 or remains unchanged based on the conditions, and `k` is increased by 1 during each iteration. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
