According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`, so `k` should now be `s`. Also, the value of `j` should be updated to be one more than the current value for the loop to continue successfully.
State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part.**
