According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the loop, `k` is an integer, so `k` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i+1`, and `j` is incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i+1` are integers, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1**
