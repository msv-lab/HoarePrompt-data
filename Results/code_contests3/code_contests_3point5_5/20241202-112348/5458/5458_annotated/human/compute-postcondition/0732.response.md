Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition `(j >= k)` is met, the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
