Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 2, `i+1` is 1, and the updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the mentioned variable states and `dp` value assignment hold true.***
