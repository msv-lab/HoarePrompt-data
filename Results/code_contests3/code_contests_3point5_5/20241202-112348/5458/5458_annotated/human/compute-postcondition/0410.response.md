Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The conditions inside the loop are not provided, so the values of `j` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k+1`, `m` are as described, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, for the loop to execute another time `k+1` should be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k+1`, `m` are as described, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, for the loop to execute another time `k+1` should be less than or equal to `s`**
