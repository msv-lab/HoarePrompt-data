Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0 when the if condition is met, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0 when the if condition is met, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
