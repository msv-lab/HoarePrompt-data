Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers, at least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the execution of the if statement, the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
