According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs+1**
