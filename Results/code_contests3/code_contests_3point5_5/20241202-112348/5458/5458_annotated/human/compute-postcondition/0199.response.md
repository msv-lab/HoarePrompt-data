Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k` have specific values assigned, `m` is determined by `i`, `s`, and `j`. The value of `mod` is based on `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 4, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 3.
Output State: **`mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 4, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 3**.
