Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `dp[i + 3 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than `s + 2***
