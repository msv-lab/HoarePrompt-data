Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the provided code snippet.***
