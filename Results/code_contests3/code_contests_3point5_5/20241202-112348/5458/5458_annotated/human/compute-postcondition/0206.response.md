Postcondition: ***`mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 4, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0, the program maintains the mentioned state. If `i` is not 0, then all variables retain their initial values and the loop does not execute. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
