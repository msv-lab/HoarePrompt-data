According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a certain value, and `m` is also specified. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated accordingly. 
State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `j` are as described, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be updated based on the conditions inside the loop**
