Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute again `s` is at least 1. If `i == 0`, then `dp[2][3][1] = 1`. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The program state remains the same after the execution of the if-else block.***
