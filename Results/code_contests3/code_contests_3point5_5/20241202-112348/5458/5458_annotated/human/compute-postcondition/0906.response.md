Postcondition: ***At the end of all iterations of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, the conditions for updating `dp` array elements described in the code are satisfied. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` remain integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied.***
