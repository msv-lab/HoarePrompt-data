Postcondition: ***`mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 2, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise the program retains its previous state. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
