Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the mentioned conditions.
Output State: **The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the mentioned conditions.**
