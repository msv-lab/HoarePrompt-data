According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` remain the same. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly based on the condition stated in the else part.
- The loop will need to run for the next value of `k`.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` remain the same. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j > k`, and the loop should be run for the next value of `k`.**
