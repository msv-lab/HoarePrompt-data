Postcondition: ***mod is equal to m + 2, n is equal to s, m is equal to i + 1, s is greater than 0, j is equal to 2, i can be either 0 or i, dp is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, j is less than or equal to m, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks, for the loop to execute k ranges from 1 to s, i is equal to 0, j is greater than or equal to k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k.***
