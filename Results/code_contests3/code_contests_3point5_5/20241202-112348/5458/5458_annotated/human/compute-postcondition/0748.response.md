Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 2, `i+1` is 1, and the elements in the `dp` array are updated based on the condition met within the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program updates the elements in the `dp` array; otherwise, there are no changes made.***
