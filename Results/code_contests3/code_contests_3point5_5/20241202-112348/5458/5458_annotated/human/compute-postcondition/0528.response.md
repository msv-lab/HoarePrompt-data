Output State: **`m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
