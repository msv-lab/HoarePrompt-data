Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `i` equals 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute another time, `k` is increased by 1. If `j > k`, then all variables remain integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` either gets assigned 1 or stays the same, and `k` is increased by 1. After executing the given code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
