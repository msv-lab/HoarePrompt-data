Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
