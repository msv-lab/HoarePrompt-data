According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. Since `k` is already set to `k` and `s` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. 
State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k`, `i` is `i`, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s` for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
