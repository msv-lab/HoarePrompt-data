Output State: The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1, k is 2, s is equal to or greater than 1. The expression updates the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be equal to the current value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. No other variables are affected by this operation.
