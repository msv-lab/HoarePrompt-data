Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m` remain the same, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m` remain the same, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop**
