According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **The value at index [n] remains the same. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. `k` is less than or equal to `s. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, the formula updates `dp` based on the mentioned formula. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain the same. `n` is greater than 0.**
