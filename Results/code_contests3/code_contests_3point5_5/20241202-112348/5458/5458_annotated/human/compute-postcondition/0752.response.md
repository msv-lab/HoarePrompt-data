According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 3, `i+1` is 1**.
