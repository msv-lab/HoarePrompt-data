Postcondition: ***`s`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs + 1, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`% mod + `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % mod.***
