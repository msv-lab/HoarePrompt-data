Postcondition: ***`s`, `k+1` range from 1 to `s+1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, updated values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the conditions. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
