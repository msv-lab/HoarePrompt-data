Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with 0 values, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. When the if condition (i == 0) is met, the value of `i` is 0. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
