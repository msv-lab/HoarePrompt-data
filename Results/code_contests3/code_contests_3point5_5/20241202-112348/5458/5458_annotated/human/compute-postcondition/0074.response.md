According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `k`, `i` is `i`, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
