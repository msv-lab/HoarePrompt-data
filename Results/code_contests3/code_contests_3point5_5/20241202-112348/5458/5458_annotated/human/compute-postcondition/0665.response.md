Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. As `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will execute. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is increased by 1 for the loop to run. The value of `k` is 1. The value of `s` is greater than 0 as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, s is equal to or greater than 1, i is equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, s is equal to or greater than 1, i is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
