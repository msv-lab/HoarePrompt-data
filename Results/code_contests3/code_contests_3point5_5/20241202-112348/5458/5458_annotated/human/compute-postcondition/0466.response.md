According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute another time, `k` needs to be increased by 1**.
