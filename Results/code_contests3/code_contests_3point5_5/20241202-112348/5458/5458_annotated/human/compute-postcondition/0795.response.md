According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2. Since `j` is incremented in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be 3.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 3, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop**
