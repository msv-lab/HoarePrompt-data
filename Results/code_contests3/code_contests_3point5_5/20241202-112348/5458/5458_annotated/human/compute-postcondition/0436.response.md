Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their initial values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
