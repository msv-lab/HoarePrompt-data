Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This assignment is based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` after the if-else block executes.
Output State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` after the if-else block executes**
