Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `k` is increased by 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j > k`, `k` may be increased by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
