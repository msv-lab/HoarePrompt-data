Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with 0 values, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If j > k, the values of the variables remain unchanged and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
