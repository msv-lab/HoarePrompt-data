Postcondition: At the end of all iterations of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, the conditions for updating `dp` array elements described in the code are satisfied. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.
