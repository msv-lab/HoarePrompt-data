Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `k` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `k` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
