Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0, the element at index `[0][j][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, the value of `dp[1][j][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[0][j][k] % mod`. If `i` is not 0, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp` is updated by adding the modulo of the element at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` in `dp. If `j >= k`, the program modifies the state of the variables as described above. If `j < k`, the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
