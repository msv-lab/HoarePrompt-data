Example Answer:
This statement assigns the value of 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is not changed but `i + 1` is used in the assignment. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and the value of `k` remains the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m` are as described, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m` are as described, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`**
