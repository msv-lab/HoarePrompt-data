According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. 

Now, to adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1
- Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated as the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`

State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, if `i` equals 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`**.
