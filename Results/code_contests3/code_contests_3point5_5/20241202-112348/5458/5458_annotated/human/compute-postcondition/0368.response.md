Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are as described, and `k` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are as described, `k` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are as described, `k` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
