Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value to be considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1. `i` is equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the program ends without any changes.***
