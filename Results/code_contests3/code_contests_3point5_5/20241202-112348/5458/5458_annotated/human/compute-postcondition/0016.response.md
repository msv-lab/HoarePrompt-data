Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` are integers, at least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
