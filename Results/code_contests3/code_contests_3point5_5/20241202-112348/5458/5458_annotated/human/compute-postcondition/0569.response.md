Postcondition: ***`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program assigns 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
