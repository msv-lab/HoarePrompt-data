Postcondition: ***At the end of all iterations of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, the conditions for updating `dp` array elements described in the code are satisfied. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When the if condition is met (i == 0), the state of the program is such that i is equal to 0. If j >= k, the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
