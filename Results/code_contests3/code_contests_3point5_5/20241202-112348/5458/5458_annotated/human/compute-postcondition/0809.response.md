According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `dp`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
