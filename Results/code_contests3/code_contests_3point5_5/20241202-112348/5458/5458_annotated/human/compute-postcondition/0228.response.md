Output State: **`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `dp[i + 3 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than `s + 1.**
