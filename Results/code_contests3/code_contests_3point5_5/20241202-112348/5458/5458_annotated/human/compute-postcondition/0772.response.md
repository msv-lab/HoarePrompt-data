Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
