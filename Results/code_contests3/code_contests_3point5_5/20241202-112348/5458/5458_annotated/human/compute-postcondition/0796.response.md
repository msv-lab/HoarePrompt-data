According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 3, `k` and `i+1` are 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` needs to be set to 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 3, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
