Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known integers, so the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` can be calculated accordingly.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`**
