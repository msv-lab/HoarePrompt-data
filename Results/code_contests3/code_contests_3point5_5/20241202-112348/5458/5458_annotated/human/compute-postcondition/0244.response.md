According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. 
Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `i` is either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `dp[i + 3 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m + 1**.
