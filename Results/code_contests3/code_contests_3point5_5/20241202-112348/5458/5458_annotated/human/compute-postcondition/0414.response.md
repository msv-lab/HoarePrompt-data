Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The variables `n`, `i`, `s`, `k+1`, and `m` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k+1`, `m` remain as described. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula.**
