According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, and the conditions related to `j`, `i`, and `dp` arrays. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `j+1`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `s` should be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`**
