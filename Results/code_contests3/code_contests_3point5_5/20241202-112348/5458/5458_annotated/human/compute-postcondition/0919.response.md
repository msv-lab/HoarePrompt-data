According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is less than the current value of `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. The conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be less than the current value of `s`.
