According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, `k` remains the same, `dp` array at index i+1 & 1, j+1, k is assigned 1 if j >= k. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp` has updated values based on the formula. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s+1`.
State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
