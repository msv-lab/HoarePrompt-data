Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if i == 0, otherwise assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j >= k`, all variables retain their initial values and assignments.***
