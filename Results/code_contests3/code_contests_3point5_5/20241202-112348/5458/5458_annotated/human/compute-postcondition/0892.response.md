Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This operation calculates the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues execution without affecting any variables.
Output State: **The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues execution without affecting any variables. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.**
