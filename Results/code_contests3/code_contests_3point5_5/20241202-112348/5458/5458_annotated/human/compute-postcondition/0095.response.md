Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp` based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. It utilizes the current and previous values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. After execution, the value of `j` is increased by 1 and `j` becomes greater than or equal to `k + 1`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is increased by 1**
