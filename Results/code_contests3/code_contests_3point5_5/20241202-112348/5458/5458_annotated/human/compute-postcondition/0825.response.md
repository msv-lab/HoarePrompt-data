Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j > k`, the state remains unchanged. The loop can execute another time if `k` is less than `s + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers**
