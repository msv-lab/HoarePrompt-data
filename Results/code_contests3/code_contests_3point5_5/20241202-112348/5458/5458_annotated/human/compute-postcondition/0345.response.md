Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
