Example Answer:
The `continue` statement will skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variable values are changed by the `continue` statement, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, and s is equal to or greater than 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k**
