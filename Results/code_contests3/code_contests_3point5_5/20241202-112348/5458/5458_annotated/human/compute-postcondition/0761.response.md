Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is `s`, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop. If `i == 0`, then `dp[1][1][s]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][1][s]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, involving modular arithmetic operations.**
