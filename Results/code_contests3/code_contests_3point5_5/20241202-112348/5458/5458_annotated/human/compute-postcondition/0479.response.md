Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop iteration and goes back to the beginning for the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is increased by 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time.
Output State: **`k` is increased by 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time**
