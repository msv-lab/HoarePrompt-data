Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.
