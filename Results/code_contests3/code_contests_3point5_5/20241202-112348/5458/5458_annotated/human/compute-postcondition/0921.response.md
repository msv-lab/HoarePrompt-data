Postcondition: ***At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. The conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be less than the current value of `s`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
