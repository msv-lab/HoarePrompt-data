Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `j` are as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After entering the if condition `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
