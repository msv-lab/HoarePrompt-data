According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `j < m`, increment `j` by 1.
- If `j = m`, increment `j` by 1 and reset `j` to 1.
- Update the values in `dp` based on the conditions mentioned in the code snippet.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, updated values in `dp` based on the conditions mentioned in the code, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `s`**
