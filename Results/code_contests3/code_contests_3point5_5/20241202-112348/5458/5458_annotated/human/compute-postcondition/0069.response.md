Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s - 1`. If `i == 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
