According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the program variables are as follows: `mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
- `k` should be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `s + 2`.
- Since `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` needs to be less than `s`.
- Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than `s` in the next iteration.

State: **`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks**.
