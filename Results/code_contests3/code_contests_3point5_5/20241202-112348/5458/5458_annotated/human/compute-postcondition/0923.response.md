Example Answer: 
The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or continue with the execution of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and we continue with the next iteration or execution of the program.
