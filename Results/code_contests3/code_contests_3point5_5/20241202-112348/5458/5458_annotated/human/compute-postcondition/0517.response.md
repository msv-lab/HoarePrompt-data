Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. The final values of these variables are dependent on the specific initial values and the conditions within the loop. The final state cannot be determined accurately without knowing the initial values and the exact conditions met during the execution of the loop.**
