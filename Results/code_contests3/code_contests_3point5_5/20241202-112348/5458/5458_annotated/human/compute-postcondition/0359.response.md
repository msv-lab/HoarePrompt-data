Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 0 or 1, updated values in dp based on the conditions mentioned in the code, s is greater than 0, k is 1, m is greater than 0, j is in the range from 1 to s. The condition (i == 0) is false, j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
