Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, and `j` remain the same. `i` is updated based on the else condition. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 in the if part. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be within the range of 1 to `s`. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k']` where `k'` is the original value of `k`.**
