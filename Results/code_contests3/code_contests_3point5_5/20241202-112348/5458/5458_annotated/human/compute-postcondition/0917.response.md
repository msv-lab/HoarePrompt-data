Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` remain integers and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.**
