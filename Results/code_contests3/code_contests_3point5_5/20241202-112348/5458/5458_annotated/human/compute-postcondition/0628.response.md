According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `The value at index [n] remains the same, n, m, and s are assigned integer values, dp is initialized with 0 values, for the loop to execute n is greater than 0` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `The value at index [n] remains the same, n, m, and s are assigned integer values, dp is initialized with 0 values, for the loop to execute n is greater than 0, j is now 1`.
State: **`The value at index [n] remains the same, n, m, and s are assigned integer values, dp is initialized with 0 values, for the loop to execute n is greater than 0, j is now 1`**
