According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is `s`, `i+1` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
1. `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
2. Since `j` has been incremented, for the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than or equal to `m`, so `m` remains unchanged at 1.
3. The other variables remain the same, and `dp[1][1][s]` needs to be updated based on the conditions in the loop involving modular arithmetic operations.

State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is `s`, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop**.
