Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and `dp` are not provided, so the output state is: *The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with 0 values, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula mentioned.
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `dp` is initialized with 0 values, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula mentioned.**
