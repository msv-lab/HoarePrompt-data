Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value to be considered in the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute s is at least 1, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues.**
