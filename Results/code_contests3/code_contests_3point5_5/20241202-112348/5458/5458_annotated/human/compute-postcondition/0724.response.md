Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, `k` is incremented to the next value in the range. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop executes one more time with the updated values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k. The new value is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
