Output State: **`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if i == 0, otherwise assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program maintains the same state as described in the precondition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
