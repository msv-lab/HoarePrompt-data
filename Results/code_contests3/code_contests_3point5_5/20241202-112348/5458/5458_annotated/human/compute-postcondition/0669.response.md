Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, k, and s are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, and s is equal to or greater than 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k.
Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m is assigned an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, k is 1, and s is equal to or greater than 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k**
