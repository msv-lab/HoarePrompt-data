According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. If `s` is 0, the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain as integers, `j` is less than `m + 1, k` is now `s + 1.
State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain as integers, `j` is less than `m + 1, k` is now `s + 1`**
