Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. The values in the `dp` 2D list have been updated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**
