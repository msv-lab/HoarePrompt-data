Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the initial state, so the output state is: `mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 2, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`mod` is equal to `m + 2`, `n` is equal to `s`, `m` is equal to `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to 2, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
