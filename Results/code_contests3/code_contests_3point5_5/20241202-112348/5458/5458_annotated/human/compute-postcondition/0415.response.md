Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k+1`, `m` are as described. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. For the loop to execute another time, `k+1` should be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the given formula. If `i != 0`, and `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
