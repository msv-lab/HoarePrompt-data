Postcondition: ***Updated values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are determined based on the conditions. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 and `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.***
