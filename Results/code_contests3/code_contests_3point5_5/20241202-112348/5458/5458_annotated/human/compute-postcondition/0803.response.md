Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial values of the variables are given as follows: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 3, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1. Since `dp` is a multi-dimensional array with the given dimensions, the assignment takes place accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 3, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 3, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is executed**
