According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is between 1 and `s` (inclusive). The initial value of k is already set to 1 in the loop statement. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states that need adjustment are:
State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2**
