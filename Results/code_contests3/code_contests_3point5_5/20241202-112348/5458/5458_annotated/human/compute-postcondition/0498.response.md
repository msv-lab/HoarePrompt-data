Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. `k` is less than `s` for the loop to execute. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the assignment statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
