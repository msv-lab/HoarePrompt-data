Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.***
