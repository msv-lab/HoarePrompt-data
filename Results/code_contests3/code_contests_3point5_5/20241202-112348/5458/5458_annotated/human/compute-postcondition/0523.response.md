Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is 1, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1. When the if condition is met (i == 0), `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
