According to the code, the loop can execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `(n^2 - 1)`.

State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `(n^2 - 1)`**
