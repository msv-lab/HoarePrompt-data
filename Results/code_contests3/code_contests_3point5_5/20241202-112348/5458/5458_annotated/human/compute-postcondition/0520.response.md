According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the loop execution, the values of variables `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `(n^2 - 1)`. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`.
State: **`m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`**.
