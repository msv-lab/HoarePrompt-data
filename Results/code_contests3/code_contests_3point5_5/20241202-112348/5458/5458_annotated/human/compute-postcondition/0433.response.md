According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` should not be equal to 0
- `j` should be greater than `k`

State: **`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
