Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
