Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The previous values of i, j, k, and mod are known, but the values of dp and mod are not provided, so the specific value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: *`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, `k` is less than `s`, i is not equal to 0 and the assignment statement dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod is executed.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, `k` is less than `s`, i is not equal to 0 and the assignment statement dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod is executed**
