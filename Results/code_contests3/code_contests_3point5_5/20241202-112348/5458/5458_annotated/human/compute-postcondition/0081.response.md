Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k`, `i` is `i`, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s` for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
