Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `m`, `n`, `j` are 0, `s` is not less than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j` are 0, `s` is not less than 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
