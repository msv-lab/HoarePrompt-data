Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` are integers. At least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0. `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
