Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` as per the condition. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.
