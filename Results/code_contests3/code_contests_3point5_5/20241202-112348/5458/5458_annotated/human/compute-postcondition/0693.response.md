Output State: **The value at index [n] remains the same, n is greater than 0, m has an integer value, s is greater than 0, j is increased by 1, k is s, s is equal to or greater than 1. If i is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s] is assigned 1 if j is greater than or equal to s. If i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][s - j] % mod.**
