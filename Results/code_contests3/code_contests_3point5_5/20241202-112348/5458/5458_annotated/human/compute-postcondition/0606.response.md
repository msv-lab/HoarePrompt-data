Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, so the output state is: `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` is now `s`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
