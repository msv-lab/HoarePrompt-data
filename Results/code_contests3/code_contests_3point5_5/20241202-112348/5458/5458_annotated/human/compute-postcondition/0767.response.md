Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i+1` are all 1, `j` is 2, elements in `dp` are updated based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` array is updated with the value 1 at index `[1][3][1]`.***
