Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` remain integers, and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue with the next iteration or execution of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue with the next iteration or execution of the program.
