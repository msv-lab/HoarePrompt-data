According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `k + 1`, and `s` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`.

State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
