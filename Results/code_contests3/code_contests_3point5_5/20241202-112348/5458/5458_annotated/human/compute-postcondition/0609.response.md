According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, and the conditions in the if-else parts. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` is updated based on the condition in the else part. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 in the if part. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly within the range of 1 to `s`. The other variables remain the same as mentioned above.

State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k` remain the same, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is updated based on the else condition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 in the if part. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be within the range of 1 to `s`.**
