Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. 
Output State: **No changes in the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.**
