Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is `m + n ** 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `n ** 2 - 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is fully updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions.**
