Example Answer:
If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The value of `k` is then increased by 1 to allow the loop to execute another time. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and `k` is increased by 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.**
