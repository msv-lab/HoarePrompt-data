Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 2, `i+1` is 1. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and if `j >= k`, the mentioned variable states and `dp` value assignment hold true. Otherwise, if `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` based on the conditions met within the loop.***
