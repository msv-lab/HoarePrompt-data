Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`**.
