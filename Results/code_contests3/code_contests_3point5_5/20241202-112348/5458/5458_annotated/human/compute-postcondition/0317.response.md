According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
