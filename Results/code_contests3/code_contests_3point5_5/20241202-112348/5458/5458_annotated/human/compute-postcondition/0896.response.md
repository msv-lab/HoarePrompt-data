According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `i`, `k`, and the condition involving `dp` array elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` % mod + `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % mod.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **At the end of all iterations of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, and the conditions for updating `dp` array elements described in the code are satisfied**.
