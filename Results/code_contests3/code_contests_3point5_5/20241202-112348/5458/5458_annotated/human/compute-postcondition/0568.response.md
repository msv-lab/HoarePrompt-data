Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, if `i` equals 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`**
