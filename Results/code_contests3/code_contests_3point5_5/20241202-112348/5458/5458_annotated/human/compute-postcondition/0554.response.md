According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
