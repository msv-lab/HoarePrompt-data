Postcondition: ***`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, the program ends without any changes. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` > `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, and the loop continues with the updated values.***
