According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `k` should be 1 since it starts from 1. To ensure the loop executes, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, and updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1**
