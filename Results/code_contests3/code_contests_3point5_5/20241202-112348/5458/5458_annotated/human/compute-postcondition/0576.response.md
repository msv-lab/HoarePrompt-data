According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. 

To determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration:
1. `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next value.
2. If the new value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`.**
