Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.***
