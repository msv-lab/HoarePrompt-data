According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `mod`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is set to 1. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i == 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is set to 1. If `j >= k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j + 1]` modulo `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s + 1`.
