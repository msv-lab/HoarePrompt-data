Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` can be either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `dp[i + 3 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
