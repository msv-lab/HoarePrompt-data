Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are now determined by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input**
