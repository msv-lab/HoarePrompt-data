According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i+1` are integers. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1**
