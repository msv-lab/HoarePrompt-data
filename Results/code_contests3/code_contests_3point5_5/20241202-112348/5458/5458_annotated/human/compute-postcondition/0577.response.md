Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the value of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. Therefore, the output state can be described as: `m`, `n`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j+1` are integers, `s` is at least 1, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
