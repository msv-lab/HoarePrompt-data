Postcondition: ***mod is equal to m + 2, n is equal to s, m is equal to i + 1, s is greater than 0, j is equal to 2, i can be either 0 or i, dp is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, j is less than or equal to m, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks, for the loop to execute k ranges from 1 to s+1. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the if else block executes.***
