Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n` > 0, `s` >= 1. The values of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished will depend on the specific conditions met within the loop. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The final state of the variables will depend on the specific conditions met during the loop execution.**
