Example Answer:
The value of `k` needs to be increased by 1 in order for the loop to execute one more time. The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to ensure the loop runs one more time. 
Output State: **`k` is increased by 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time**
