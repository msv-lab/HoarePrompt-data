Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s`, the new value is assigned to `dp[1][m + 2][s]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is assigned the value 1**
