Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state has `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` as integers. After running the code snippet, the affected variables are updated based on the calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
