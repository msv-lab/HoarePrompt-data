Postcondition: ***mod is equal to m + 2, n is equal to s, m is equal to i + 1, s is greater than 0, j is equal to 3, k is equal to s, i can be either 0 or i, dp is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, j is less than or equal to m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0 and k is 1, i is not equal to 0***
