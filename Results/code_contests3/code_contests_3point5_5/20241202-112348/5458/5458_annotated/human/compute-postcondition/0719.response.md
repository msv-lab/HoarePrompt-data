Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n` > 0, `s` >= 1. After the if else block, the value at index [n] remains the same, `j` is increased by 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 when j >= k.***
