According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`, which means `k` needs to be decremented by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s - 1`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
