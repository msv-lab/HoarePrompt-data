Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `n` is less than `n`, `j` is the next value considered in the range of 1 to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration or statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
