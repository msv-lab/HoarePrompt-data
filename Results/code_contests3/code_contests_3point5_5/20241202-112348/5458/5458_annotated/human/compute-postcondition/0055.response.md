According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`**
