According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Since `s` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks, for the loop to execute `k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
