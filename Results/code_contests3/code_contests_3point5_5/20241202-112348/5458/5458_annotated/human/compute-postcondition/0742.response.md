Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and further updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
