Postcondition: ***`mod` is `m + 2`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `i` is either 0 or `i + 1`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `dp[i + 3 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the if and else conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than `s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
