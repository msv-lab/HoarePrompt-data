Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i, j, k, s, m` are all involved in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0, and the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has taken place.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0, and the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has taken place**
