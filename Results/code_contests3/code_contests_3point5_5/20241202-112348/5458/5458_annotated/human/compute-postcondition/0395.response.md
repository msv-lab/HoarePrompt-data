Output State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `j` are as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated based on the conditions inside the loop. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. When the if condition is met, `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
