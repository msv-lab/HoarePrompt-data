Output State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k`, `i` is `i`, `dp` is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` as described in the code snippet. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
