Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 0, `i+1` is 1, updated elements in `dp` based on the conditions met within the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1` if `j >= k`.***
