Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs + 1, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`% mod, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % mod.**
