According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, the variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, and `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `dp` is initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`**
