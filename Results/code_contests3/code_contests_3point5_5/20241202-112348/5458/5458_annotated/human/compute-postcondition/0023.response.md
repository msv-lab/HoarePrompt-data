Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment, but their previous values are not provided. The output state will be updated with this new assignment.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` are integers. At least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0. `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.**
