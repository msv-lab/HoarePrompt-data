Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. If `j >= k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The loop should continue for the next value of `k` where `j > k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]`, `dp[i+1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` remain the same. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j > k`, and the loop should be run for the next value of `k`.**
