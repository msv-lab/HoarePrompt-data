Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, and `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is true, the program state remains the same as the precondition with the additional condition that j is greater than or equal to k.
