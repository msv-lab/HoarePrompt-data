According to the code, the loop executes from 1 to m (inclusive). If the loop is to execute one more time, the value of j should be less than or equal to m. At the end of the last iteration, j is equal to m. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, j should be incremented by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, for the loop to execute one more time j should be equal to m + 1**
