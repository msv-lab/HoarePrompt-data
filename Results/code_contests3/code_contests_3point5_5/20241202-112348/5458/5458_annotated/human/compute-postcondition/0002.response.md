Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the initial state of `mod` is not affected by this code snippet, the output state is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers**
