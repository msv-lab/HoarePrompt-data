Output State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated using the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
