According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **After all iterations, `m`, `n`, `j+1`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
