Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `dp` is initialized with updated values based on the formula mentioned. `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, the formula updates `dp` based on the mentioned formula. The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain the same. `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` > `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop or if statement being executed.***
