Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop, `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `j` will have final values based on the conditions inside the loop. The elements in `dp` will be updated according to the calculations performed in each iteration. The final state of the variables will be determined by the specific conditions met during the loop iterations.**
