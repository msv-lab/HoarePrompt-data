Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` and other variables are adjusted based on the loop conditions. If `j > k`, then the state of the program is updated as described in the if part. If the condition is not satisfied, there is no change in the state of the program.***
