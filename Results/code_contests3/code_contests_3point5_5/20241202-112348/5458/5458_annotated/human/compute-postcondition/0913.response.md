Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` remain the same. The condition for updating `dp` array elements is satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **At the end of the iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, conditions for updating `dp` array elements are satisfied, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
