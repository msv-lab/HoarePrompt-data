Output State: **`k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][m + 2][s]` is either 1 or updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` depending on the conditions `j > k` or `j <= k`. After executing the code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
