According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and the conditions specified for updating `k` and `dp` values. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as described. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

If `j >= k` and `i == 0`, then `k` is increased by 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.

If `j > k`, then `k` may be increased by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are as follows:
State: **`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are as described. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `k` is increased by 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j > k`, `k` may be increased by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**.
