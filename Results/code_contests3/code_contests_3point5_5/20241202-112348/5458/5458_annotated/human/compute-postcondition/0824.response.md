Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j > k`, the state remains unchanged. The loop can execute another time if `k` is less than `s + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j > k`, the state remains unchanged. The loop can execute another time if `k` is less than `s + 1`**
