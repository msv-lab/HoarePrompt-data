Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Based on the condition `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the provided code snippet**
