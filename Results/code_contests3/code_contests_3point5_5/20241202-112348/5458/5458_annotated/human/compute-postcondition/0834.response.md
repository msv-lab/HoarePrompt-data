Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by 1. When the if condition is met (`i == 0`), `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the postcondition is satisfied.**
