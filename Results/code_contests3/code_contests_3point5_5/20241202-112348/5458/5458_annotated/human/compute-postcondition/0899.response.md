Postcondition: ***At the end of all iterations of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `i` are integers, the conditions for updating `dp` array elements described in the code are satisfied. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When the if condition is met (i == 0), the state of the program is such that i is equal to 0. Additionally, when the if condition (j >= k) is met, the values of `j` and `k` are such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
