Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are integers. At least one of `n`, `m`, or `s` is greater than 0. `dp` is a 2D list initialized based on the values of `m` and `s`. `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if else block, the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
