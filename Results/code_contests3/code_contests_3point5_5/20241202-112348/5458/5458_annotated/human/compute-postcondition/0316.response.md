Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are determined by the input. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, `s`. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`.**
