Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `s`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `s`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated according to the conditions of the if and else blocks.**
