Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i+1` are integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. `j` is incremented by the total number of times the loop runs. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated and accumulated according to the calculations in the loop code.**
