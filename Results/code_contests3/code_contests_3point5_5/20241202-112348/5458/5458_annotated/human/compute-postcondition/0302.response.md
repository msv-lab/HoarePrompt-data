Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`k` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `m + 2`, `i` is equal to 0**
