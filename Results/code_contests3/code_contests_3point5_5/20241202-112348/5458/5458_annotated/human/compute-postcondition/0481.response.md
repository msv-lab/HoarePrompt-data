Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not mentioned, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is increased by 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time. Otherwise, there is no change in the value of `k`.
Output State: **`k` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is increased by 1 to ensure the loop executes one more time. Otherwise, there is no change in the value of `k`.**
