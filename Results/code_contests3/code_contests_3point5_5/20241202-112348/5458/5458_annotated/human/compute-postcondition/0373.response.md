Postcondition: ***`n`, `i`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are as described. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `k` is increased by 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, in the else part, `n`, `i`, `dp`, `s` remain unchanged. If `j > k`, `k` may be increased by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
