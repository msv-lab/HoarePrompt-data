Example Answer:
If `i` equals 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i` does not equal 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will remain unchanged. For the loop to execute another time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will either get assigned 1 or stay the same based on the value of `i`, and `k` will be increased by 1.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will either get assigned 1 or stay the same, `k` will be increased by 1**
