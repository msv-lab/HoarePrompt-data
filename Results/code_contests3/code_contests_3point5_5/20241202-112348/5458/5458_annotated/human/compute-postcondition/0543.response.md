According to the given code snippet, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers meeting the specified conditions. Since the loop is iterating over `k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`m`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer less than `(n^2 - 1)`, if `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than or equal to `m`, `s` is an integer, `k` is an integer less than `s + 1`**
