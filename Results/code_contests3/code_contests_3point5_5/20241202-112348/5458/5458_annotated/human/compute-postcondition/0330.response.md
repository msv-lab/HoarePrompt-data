Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions `(m + 2)` x `(s + 1)` x `2`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod` after the execution of the program fragment.`**
