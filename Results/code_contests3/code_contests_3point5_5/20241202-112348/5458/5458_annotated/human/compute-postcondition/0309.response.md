Output State: **At the end of the loop, `k` will be equal to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts. The final values of the variables depend on the iterations of the loop and the conditions within it.**
