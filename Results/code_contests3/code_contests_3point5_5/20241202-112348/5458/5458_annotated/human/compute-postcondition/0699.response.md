Postcondition: ***The value at index [n] remains the same, `n` is greater than 0, `m` has an integer value, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program state remains the same as the precondition with the additional condition that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
