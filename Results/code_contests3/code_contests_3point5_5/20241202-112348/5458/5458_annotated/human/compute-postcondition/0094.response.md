Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation. The value of `mod` is `m + 1`, and the value of `n` is `k + 1`, which are also used in the calculation. After the assignment, the value of `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` after the if-else block executes, `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`mod` is `m + 1`, `n` is `k + 1`, `m` is `i`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or `i`, `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the if and else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` after the if-else block executes, `j` is increased by 1**
