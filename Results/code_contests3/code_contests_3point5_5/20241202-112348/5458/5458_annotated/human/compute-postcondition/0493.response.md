Example Answer:
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, `k` is less than `s`, i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers, `k` is less than `s`, i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k**
