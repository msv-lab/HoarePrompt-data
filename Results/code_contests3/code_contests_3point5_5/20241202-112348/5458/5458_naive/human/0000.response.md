Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It uses dynamic programming to iterate through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card and calculates the number of ways to achieve the sum S. The program handles all cases where N, M, and S are within the specified constraints and outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created. Since the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected, the correctness is True.
