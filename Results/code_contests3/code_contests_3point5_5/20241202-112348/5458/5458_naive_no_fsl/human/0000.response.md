Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. The code initializes a 3D array `dp` to store the number of ways to form the Bingo card. It then iterates through all possible combinations of integers in the squares, updating the `dp` array based on the conditions provided in the problem description. Finally, it prints the result modulo 100000.

The code covers all possible cases and follows the conditions specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created for the given input parameters. Since no specific case is mentioned where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
