The function `func` reads inputs for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all three are zero. It then initializes a 2D list `dp` based on certain conditions and calculates values for this list. Finally, it prints a specific value from `dp`. The function operates within the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function does not return any value.
