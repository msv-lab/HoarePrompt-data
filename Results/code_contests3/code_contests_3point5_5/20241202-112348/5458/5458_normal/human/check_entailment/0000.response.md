Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly solves the problem description by creating Bingo cards that meet the specified conditions. It initializes a 2D list `dp` based on certain conditions and calculates values for this list. Finally, it prints a specific value from `dp`. The program handles multiple datasets and computes the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created, dividing the result by 100000. The code operates within the constraints provided in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and confirm that it correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created.
