According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers between 1 and `m`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 and all other variables remain the same.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `i` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized**
