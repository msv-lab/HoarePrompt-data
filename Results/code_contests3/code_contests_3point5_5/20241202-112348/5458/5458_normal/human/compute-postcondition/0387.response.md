Postcondition: ***n and m are integers greater than 0, s is at least 1, j is 3, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1, for the loop to execute k is in the range 1 to s. Additionally, when the condition (i == 0) is met, the program state is such that i is 0. Furthermore, j is greater than or equal to k***
