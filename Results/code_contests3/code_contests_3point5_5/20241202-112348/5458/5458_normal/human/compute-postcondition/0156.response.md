According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1 but not exceed `s`.
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is updated with the value 1 if `i == 0`, otherwise it is updated with the calculated value. For the loop to execute `s` is an integer and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`.**
