According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range 1 to s. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` should be updated to `M + 1`, `j`, `i`, `k`, and `mod` may also need to be updated based on the loop body logic.

State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated**
