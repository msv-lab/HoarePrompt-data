Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` are integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
