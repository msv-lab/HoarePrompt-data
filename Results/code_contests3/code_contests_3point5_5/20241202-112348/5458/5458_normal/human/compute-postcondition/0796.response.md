According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, starting from `k = 1` to `k = s`. The loop execution also depends on the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp`. In order for the loop to execute another time, `j` should be less than `m`. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp` is an integer, for the loop to execute another time `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1**
