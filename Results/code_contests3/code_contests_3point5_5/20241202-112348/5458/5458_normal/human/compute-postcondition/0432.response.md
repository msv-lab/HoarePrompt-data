Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
