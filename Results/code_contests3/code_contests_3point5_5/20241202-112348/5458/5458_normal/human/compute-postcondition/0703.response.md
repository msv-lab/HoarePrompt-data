Example Answer:
Since the `continue` statement is encountered, the program will skip the rest of the code in the loop and continue with the next iteration. As a result, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
