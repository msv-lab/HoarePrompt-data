Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+2`, `k+s`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. When the if condition `(i == 0)` is met, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are assigned 1.***
