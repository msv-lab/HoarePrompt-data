Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. When `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is updated with 1. If `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`. The loop executes if `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `j > k`, no variables are altered and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
