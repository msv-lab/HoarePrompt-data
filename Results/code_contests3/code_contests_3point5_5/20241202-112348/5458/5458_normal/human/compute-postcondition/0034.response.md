Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change based on this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
