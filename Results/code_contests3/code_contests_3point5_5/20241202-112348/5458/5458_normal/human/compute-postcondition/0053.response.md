Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated. i is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated. i is not equal to 0**
