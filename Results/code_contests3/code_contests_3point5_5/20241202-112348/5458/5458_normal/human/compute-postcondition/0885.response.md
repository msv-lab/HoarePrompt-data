Postcondition: ***`n+1`, `m+1`, `s+1`, `i+2`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers increased by 1. `s` is greater than 0. `dp` is increased by 1. If `i == 0`, `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `j >= k`, the program variables are increased by 1 and `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
