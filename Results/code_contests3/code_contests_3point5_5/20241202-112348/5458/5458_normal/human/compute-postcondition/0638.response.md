Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. The loop can execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
