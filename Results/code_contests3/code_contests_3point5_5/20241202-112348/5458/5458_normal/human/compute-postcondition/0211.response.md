According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and the `dp` 2D list are initialized appropriately, but `m` is at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i`, `j`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` is initialized appropriately, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
