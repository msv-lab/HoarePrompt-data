Output State: **All variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and the `dp` 2D list are appropriately initialized. The loop will run for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be calculated based on the previous values and mod.**
