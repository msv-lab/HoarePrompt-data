Output State: **`i`, `j+2`, `k+s`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If j > k, the value of `j` is greater than the value of `k`. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. After executing the code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
