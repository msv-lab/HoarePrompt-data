Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. When the condition (i == 0) is met, `i` equals 0. Additionally, after the if condition (j >= k) is met, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
