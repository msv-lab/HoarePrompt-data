Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since the initial state is not provided, the exact values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in the program state.
Output State: **No change in the program state**
