Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
