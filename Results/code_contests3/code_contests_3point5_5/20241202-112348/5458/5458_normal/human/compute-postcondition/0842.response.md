Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are all 1. The condition `(i == 0)` is false. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod` and then incremented by the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
