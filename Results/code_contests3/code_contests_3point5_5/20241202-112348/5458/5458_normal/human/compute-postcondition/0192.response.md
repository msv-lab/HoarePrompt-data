Output State: **`i`, `j+2`, `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. For the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s+1`, `i`, `j+1` and `k` are assigned 1 based on the conditions stated above. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
