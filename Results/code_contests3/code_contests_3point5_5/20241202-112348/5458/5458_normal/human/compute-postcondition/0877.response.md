According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1 as well. 
State: **`n+1`, `m+1`, `s+1`, `i+2`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `dp` are increased by 1. For the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0**
