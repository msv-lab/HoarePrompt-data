Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. No changes occur in the program state when the condition `j > k` is satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes occur in the program state when the condition `j > k` is satisfied.
Output State: **No changes occur in the program state when the condition `j > k` is satisfied.**
