Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly stated, so the output state is: All variables remain the same, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
