According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 and must be between 1 and `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and be between 1 and `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1**.
