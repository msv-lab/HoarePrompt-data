Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. The loop will execute `s` times. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 for all values of `j` and `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the values of `dp` will be calculated based on the conditions in the loop. After all iterations, the final values of `dp` will be dependent on the initial values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`.**
