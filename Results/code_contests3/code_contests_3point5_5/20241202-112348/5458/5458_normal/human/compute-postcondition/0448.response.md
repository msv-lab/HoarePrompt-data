Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur, and the program continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1).
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1)**
