Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop executes one more time when `k + 2` is within the range 1 to S. If `j > k`, the program follows the initial conditions. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
