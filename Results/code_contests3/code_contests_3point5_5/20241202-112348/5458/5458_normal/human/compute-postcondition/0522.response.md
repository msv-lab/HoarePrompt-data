Postcondition: ***n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. The final values of j+1, i, k are integers between 1 and m. For the loop to execute one more time i is incremented by 1 and must be less than n. j is less than m, k is between 1 and s. i is equal to 0***
