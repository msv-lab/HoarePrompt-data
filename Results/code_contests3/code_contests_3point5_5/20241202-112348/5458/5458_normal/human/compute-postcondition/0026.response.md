Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement will skip the remaining code inside the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the loop will continue executing with `k` incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1`. The values of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1`**
