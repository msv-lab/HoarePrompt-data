Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly changed by this operation unless `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
