Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are known. Therefore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated accordingly based on the modulo operation. 
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation**
