According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `n`. If `m` and `n` are at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list with all elements as 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is an integer input from the user, and `j` is now 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, for the loop to execute `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `j` is 1**
