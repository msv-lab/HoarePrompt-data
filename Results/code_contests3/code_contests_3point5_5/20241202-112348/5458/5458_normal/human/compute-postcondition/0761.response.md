Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. The final values of the elements in `dp` will be determined based on the conditions met during the execution of the loop. If the loop does not execute, all variables will remain unchanged.**
