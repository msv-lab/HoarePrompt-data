Output State: **All variables remain integers greater than 0, `dp` is still a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. The values of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod based on the specified conditions.**
