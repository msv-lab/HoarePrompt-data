Postcondition: ***Regardless of the value of `i`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` remain unchanged and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `i`, `j`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` remain integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Moreover, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m` are updated based on the loop conditions involving `j`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value.***
