Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). If `j >= k`, the loop will execute with `k` set to 1. Otherwise, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values.***
