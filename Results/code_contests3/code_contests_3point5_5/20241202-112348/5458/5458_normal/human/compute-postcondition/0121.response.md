Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`**
