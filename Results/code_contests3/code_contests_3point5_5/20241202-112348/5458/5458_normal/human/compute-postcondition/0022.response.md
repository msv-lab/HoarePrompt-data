According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, and `i` have specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` should be `k+1` within the range of 1 to `s+1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1`**
