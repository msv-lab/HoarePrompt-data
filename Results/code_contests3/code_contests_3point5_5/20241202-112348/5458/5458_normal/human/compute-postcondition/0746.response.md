Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the next time `k` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains at least 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the next time `k` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains at least 1**
