According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 1`, `k` starts at 1, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0. 

To adjust for the next iteration:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `k + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`**
