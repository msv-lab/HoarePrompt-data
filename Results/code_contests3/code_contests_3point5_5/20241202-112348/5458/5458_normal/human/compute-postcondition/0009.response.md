According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the conditions need to be adjusted such that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, and `m` is greater than 0.
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
