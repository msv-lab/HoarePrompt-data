Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since all elements of `dp` are initialized to 0, the value remains 0 after the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
