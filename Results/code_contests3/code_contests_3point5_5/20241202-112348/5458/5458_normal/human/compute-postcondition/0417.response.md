Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except for specific elements that have been modified according to the conditions within the loop. The final values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are a result of the calculations made during each iteration of the loop, with the last iteration reflecting the cumulative changes made throughout the loop execution.**
