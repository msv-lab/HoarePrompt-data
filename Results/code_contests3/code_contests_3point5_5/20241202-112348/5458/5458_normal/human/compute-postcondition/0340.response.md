Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If i == 0, then after running the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, then `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
