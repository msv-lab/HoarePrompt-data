Output State: **`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 2`, `k + 2`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`. If j > k, all variables are incremented by 1 except for j which is incremented by 2. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
