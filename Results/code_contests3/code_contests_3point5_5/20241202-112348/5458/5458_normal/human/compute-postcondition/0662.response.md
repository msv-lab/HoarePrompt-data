According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is between 1 and `s`, inclusive. 
Before the loop starts, the next iteration should have `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` as `m + 1`, `k` as 1, and `dp` properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`).
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), for the loop to execute the first time `k` is between 1 and `s`**
