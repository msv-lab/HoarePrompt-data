Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized. The final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be equal to `s + 1`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`.***
