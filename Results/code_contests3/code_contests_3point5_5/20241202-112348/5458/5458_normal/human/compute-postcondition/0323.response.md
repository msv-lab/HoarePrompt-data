Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0. If `i` is 0, then this state is maintained. In addition, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at index [i+1 & 1][j+1][k] in dp is assigned the value 1.***
