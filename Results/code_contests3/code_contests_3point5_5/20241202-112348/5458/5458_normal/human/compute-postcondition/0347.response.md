Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since all elements of `dp` are initially 0, the result will be 0 as well. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with all elements as 0, `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with all elements as 0, `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k`**
