Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. For the loop to execute, `k` is in the range 1 to `s`. If `i == 0`, the value in the dp list at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if j >= k. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` and `k` are integers in the range 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
