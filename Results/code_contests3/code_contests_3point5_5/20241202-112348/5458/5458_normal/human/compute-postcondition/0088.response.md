According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N, M + 1, S are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2. J is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, S is greater than 0, and k starts at 2.**
