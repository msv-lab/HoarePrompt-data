Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) remains properly initialized, `j` is greater than `k+1`. No changes occur in the program state when the condition `j > k` is satisfied.***
