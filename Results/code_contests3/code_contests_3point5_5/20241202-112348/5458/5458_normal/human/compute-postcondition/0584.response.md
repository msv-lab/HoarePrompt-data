Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized. Final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, then the program retains the same state as the precondition. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
