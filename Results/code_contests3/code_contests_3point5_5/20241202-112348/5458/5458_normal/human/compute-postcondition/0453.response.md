According to the code, the loop can execute if the range of k from 1 to s+1 is valid. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute**
