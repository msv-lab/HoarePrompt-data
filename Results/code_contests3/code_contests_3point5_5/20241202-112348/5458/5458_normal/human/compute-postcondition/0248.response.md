Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, and the updated `dp` 2D list are properly initialized. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, all variables retain their previous values, and the updated value of the `dp` 2D list at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.***
