Postcondition: ***n, m, s are integers between 1 and m, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized, j+1, i, k are integers between 1 and m. If j > k, there is no change in the variables, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the if condition.***
