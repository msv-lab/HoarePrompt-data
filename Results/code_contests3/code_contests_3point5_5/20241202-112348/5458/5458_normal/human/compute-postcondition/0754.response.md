Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations mentioned in the else part. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be less than `s`.***
