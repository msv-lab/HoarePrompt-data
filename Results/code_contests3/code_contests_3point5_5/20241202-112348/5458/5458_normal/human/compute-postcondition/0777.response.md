Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, `i + 1 & 1` is equivalent to `i + 1 % 2`, which will either be 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
