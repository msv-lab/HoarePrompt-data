According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k + 1` is within the range 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, and `k + 1` was within the range 1 to `S`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still fall within the range 1 to `S`.
State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 2` is within the range 1 to S**
