Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`. `j` is less than `m`, `k` is between 1 and `s`, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.***
