According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j+1` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. 
State: **`i`, `j+2`, `k+s`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k+s]` will be updated according to the loop code.**
