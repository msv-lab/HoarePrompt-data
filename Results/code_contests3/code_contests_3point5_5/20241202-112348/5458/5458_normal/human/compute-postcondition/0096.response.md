Postcondition: ***N, M + 1, S are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2. J is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, S is greater than 0, and k starts at 2. If i == 0, and j >= k, the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If i != 0, and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated based on the modulo operation. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
