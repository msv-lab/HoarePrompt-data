Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. We continue with the next iteration of the loop or if statement.**
