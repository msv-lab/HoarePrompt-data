According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2.**
