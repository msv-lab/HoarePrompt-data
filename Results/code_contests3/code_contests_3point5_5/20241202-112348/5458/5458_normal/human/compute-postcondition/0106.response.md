Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N`, `M + 1`, `S` remain as positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2. `J` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
