According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, if `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, then the loop should not execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, the 2D list `dp` needs to be initialized with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` and all elements set to 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` and all elements are 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
