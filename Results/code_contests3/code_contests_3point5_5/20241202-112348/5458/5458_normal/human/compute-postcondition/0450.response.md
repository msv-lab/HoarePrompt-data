Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1). If `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
