The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulus of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to the variable `mod`. The initial state remains the same, with the only change being the update of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated. i is not equal to 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`.**
