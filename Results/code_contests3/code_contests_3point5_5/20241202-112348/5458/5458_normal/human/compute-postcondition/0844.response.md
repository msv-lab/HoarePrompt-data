According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are all integers with specific values. If `i` is 0, then `n`, `m` can either be 0 or `i+1`, `i` can either be 0 or `i+1`, `j`, `k` are 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`. If `(i == 0)` is false, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` all become 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Increment `k` by 1.
- If `k` becomes equal to or greater than `s+1`, then the loop will not execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` have specific values, `dp` is updated accordingly, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be less than `s+1`**
