Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. When the if condition is true, `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
