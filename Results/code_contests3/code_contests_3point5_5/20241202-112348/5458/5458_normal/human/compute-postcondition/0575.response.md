Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i == 0`, then no change in variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j`; `k` is 3. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is incremented by 1, and a specific calculation is performed on the `dp` list according to the given formula.***
