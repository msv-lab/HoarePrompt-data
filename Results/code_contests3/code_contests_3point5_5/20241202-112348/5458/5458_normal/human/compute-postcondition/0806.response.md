Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. For the loop to execute another time, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, the program continues to the next iteration or block of code. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
