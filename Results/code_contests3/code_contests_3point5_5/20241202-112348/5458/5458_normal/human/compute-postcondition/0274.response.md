Postcondition: ***All variables are appropriately initialized. After the execution of the if-else block, 'k' is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the condition 'j >= k'. The 'dp' 2D list is updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. If 'i' is equal to 0, the loop continues with the updated 'k' and 'dp' list. If 'i' is not equal to 0, 'k' is either incremented by 1 or remains the same, 'dp' 2D list is updated based on the formula, and the loop continues the execution. Additionally, a value or variable has been returned.***
