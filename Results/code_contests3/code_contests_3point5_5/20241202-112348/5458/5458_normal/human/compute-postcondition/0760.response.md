Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i == 0`, the postcondition remains the same. If `i != 0`, then when `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `j < k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than `s`, and if `j > k`, the loop iterates without changing the variables.***
