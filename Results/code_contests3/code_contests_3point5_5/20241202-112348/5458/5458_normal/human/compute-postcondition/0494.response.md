Example Answer:
The value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
