Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop continues executing as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is not greater than `k`. No changes occur if `j > k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
