Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
