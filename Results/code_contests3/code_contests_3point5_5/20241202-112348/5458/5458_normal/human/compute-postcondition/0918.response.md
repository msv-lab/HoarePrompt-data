Postcondition: ***`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 3`, `j + 2`, `k` is at its limit, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program variables are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 2`, `k + 2`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
