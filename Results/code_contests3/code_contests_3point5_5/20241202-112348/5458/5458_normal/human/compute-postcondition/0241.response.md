Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `j`, `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are appropriately initialized. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `j >= k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented within the range from 1 to `s`. If `i == 0`, the program handles the if part conditions. Otherwise, the program executes the else part where the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous values and mod.***
