Example Answer: 
A value of 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is an integer, `i + 1` will be the new value of `i`. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the new value after incrementing by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`i` is the new value after incrementing by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
