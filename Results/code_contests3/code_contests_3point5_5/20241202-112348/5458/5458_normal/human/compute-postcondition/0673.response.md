Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged. `k` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: At the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged, `k` is still 1, and `dp` is properly updated with the new calculated values.
Output State: **At the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged, `k` is still 1, and `dp` is properly updated with the new calculated values.**
