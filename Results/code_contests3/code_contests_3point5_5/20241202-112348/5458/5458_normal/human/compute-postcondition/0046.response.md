Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated. `i` is equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
