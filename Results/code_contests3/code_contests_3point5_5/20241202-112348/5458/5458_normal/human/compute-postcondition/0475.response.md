According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, and the loop can execute again if `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be adjusted such that it is still an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is still greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be adjusted such that it is less than `s**`.
