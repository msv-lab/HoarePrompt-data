Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state of `i` is an integer, the value of `i` is used in the calculation. The other variables `j` and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`i` is an integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
