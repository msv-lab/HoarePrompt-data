Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j > k`, the loop continues to execute. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `k` is incremented by 1, `dp` 2D list is updated based on the formula, and if `j > k`, the loop continues to execute.
Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1, `dp` 2D list is updated based on the formula, and if `j > k`, the loop continues to execute**
