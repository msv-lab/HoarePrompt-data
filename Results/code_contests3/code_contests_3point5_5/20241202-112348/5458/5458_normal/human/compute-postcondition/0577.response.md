Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`, and `j + 1` and `k` are incremented by 1. All variables remain within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1**
