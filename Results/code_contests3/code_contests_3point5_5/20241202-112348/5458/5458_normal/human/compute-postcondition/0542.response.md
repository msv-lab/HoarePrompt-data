Postcondition: ***n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. The final values of j+1, i+1, k+1 are integers between 1 and m. If i == 0 and j >= k, no changes occur to the program state. Otherwise, the program state changes depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod`.***
