According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `j` is initially 1, so it needs to be adjusted to 1. Additionally, since `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), it needs to be properly initialized. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i+1`, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized**.
