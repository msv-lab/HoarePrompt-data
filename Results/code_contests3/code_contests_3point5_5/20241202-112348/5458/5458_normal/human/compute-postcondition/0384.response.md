According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 3, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1**.
