Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i, j, and k are not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume their values are 0, 1, and 1 respectively. Therefore, dp[1][2][2] is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` has elements 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, `k` is 2**
