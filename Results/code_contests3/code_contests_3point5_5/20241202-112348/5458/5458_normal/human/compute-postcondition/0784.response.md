Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i == 0` and `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or condition without any changes to the variables. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
