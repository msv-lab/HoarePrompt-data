According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, and `dp` are already integers and properly initialized. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the only change needed is to set `k` to 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
