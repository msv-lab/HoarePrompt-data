According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized**.
