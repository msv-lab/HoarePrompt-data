Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
