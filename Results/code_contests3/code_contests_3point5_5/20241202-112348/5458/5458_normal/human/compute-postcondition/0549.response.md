Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The loop continues without any change in the values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: *`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`.
Output State: ***`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`.***
