Postcondition: ***N, M + 1, S are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2. J is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, S is greater than 0, and k starts at 1. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and updated by adding the remainder of dividing dp[i & 1][j][k - j] by mod.***
