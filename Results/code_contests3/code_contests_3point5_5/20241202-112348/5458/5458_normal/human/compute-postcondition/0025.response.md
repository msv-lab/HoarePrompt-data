Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1`**
