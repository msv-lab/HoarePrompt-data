Postcondition: ***`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise no changes are made to the variables.***
