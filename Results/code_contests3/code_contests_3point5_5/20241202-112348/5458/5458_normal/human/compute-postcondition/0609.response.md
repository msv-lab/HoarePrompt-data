According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is equal to `s` at the end of the previous iteration. The loop iterates through the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 to reach `s`.
State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be equal to `s + 1`.**
