Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2 or greater than 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1 and dp[2][3][2] which is also 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
