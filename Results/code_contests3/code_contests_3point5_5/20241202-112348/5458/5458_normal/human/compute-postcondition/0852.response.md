Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` have specific values. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j` maintain their specific values while `k` is updated to be less than `s+1`. Additionally, `dp` is updated with a value of `1` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i != 0`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` have specific values, `dp` is updated with the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
