Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i+1`, `j+1`, and `k` have all been increased by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `dp[1][2][2]` will be 1.
Output State: **`n+1`, `m+1`, `s+1`, `i+2`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `dp` are increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `dp[1][2][2]` is 1**
