According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be incremented. At the end of the loop, the values of n, m, s, dp, j+1, i, k are properly initialized and within the specified ranges. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, k should be equal to s.
State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s`**
