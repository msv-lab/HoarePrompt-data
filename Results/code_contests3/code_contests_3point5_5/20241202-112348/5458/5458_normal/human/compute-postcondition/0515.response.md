Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is incremented by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` in the `dp` list modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized.**
