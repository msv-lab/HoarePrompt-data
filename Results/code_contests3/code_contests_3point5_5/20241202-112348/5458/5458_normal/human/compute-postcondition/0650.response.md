Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. After executing the code snippet, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. All variables remain integers between 1 and `m`, 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) remains properly initialized, loop continues execution if `j > k`.***
