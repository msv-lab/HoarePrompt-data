Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables and the program continues its execution.***
