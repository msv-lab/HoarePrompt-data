Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is an integer and not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the previous values of the affected variables are not directly given. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
