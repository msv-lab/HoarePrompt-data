According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
