Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n, m, s are integers between 1 and m, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized, j+1, i, k are integers between 1 and m, s is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition (j > k) is true**
