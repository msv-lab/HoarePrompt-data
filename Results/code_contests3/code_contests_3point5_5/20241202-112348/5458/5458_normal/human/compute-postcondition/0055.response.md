According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is within the range 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated accordingly.
