Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged. `k` is still 1 and the `dp` array is properly initialized. Therefore, the Output State is: At the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged, `k` is still 1, and `dp` is properly initialized with updated values based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **At the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged, `k` is still 1, and `dp` is properly updated with the new calculated values.**
