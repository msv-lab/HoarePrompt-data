According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1 and `s` should remain at least 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the next time `k` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains at least 1**
