Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2], dp[m + 1][j + 1][2], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] which are 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.***
