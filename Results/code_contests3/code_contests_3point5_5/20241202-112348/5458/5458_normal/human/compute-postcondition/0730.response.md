According to the code, the loop can execute if the range of `k` is between 1 and `s` inclusive. Therefore, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i+1`, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1**
