Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `k` starts at 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
