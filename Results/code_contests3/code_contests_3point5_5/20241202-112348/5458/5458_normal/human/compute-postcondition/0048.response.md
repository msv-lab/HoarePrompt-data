Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range 1 to S, `j`, `i`, and `mod` may also be updated. i is not equal to 0. The value of `j` is greater than `k`.***
