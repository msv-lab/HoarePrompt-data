Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop executes the first time `m` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the value of `j` is greater than `k`. After the execution of the code snippet, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
