Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. i is not equal to 0. Moreover, `j` is greater than `k`***
