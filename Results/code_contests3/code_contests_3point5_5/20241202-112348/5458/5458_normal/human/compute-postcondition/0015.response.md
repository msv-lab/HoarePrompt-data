Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop executes the first time `m` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, the value of `j` is greater than `k`***
