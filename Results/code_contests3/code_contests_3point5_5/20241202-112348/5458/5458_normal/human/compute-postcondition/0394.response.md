Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. For the loop to execute, `k` is in the range 1 to `s`. If `j` > `k`, the loop continues execution with no change in the state of the variables.***
