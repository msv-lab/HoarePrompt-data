Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not modified by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. The final values of j+1, i+1, k+1 are integers between 1 and m.
Output State: **n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. The final values of j+1, i+1, k+1 are integers between 1 and m.**
