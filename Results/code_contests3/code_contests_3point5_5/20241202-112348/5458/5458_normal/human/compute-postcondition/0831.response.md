According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `n`, `m`, `i+1`, `j`, `dp` are still 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0**
