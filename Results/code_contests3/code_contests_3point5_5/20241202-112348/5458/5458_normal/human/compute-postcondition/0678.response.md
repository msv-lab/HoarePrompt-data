Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The `&` operator represents a bitwise AND operation. The previous values for `i`, `j`, `k` are known as they are given in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), for the loop to execute the second time `k` is between 1 and `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values.
