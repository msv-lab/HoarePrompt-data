Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since no specific initial values are provided, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes in variables.
Output State: **No changes occur in the variables and the program continues its execution.**
