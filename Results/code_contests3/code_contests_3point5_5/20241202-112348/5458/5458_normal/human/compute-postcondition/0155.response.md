Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value 1 if `i == 0`, otherwise it is updated with the calculated value. For the loop to execute `s` is an integer and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
