According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, and `k` is incremented by 1**
