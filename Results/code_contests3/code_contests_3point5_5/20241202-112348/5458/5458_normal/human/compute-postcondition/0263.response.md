Example Answer: 
The formula updates the `dp` 2D list based on the previous values in the list. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulus of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. Since `k` is incremented by 1, the loop will execute one more time. If `j > k`, the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is incremented by 1, `dp` 2D list is updated based on the formula, and if `j > k`, the loop continues to execute.
Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1, `dp` 2D list is updated based on the formula, and if `j > k`, the loop continues to execute**
