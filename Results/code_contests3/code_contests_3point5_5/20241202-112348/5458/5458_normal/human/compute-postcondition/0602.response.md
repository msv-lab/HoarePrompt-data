Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, if `j >= k`***
