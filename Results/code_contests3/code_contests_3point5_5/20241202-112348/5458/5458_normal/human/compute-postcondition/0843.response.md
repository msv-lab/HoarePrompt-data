Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are all integers with specific values. The loop executes with `s` being greater than 0. If `i` is 0, then `n`, `m` can either be 0 or `i+1`, `i` can either be 0 or `i+1`, `j`, `k` are 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`. If `(i == 0)` is false, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` all become 1. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.***
