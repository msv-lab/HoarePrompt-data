According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes 3.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the third time, `k` is 3**.
