Since the loop conditions and operations do not lead to any changes in the variables' values, the state at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the initial state. Since the values of the variables will remain the same throughout all iterations, no adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No adjustments needed, loop will execute again with the same initial state**
