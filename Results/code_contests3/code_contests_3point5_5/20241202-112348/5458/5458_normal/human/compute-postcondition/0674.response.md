Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), for the loop to execute the first time `k` is between 1 and `s`, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part. In the if part, the state of the variables remains unchanged, while in the else part, `dp` is properly updated with the new calculated values.***
