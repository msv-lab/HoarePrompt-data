Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided, so the output state is: `i` is an integer and not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes.
Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes**
