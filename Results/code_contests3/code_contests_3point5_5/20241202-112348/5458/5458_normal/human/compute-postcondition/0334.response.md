Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be incremented by 1. After running the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
