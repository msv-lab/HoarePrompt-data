Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, but based on the code structure, it can be inferred that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) remains properly initialized, `j` is greater than `k+1`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) remains properly initialized, `j` is greater than `k+1`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
