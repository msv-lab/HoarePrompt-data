Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state provides the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, and the dimensions of `dp`, we can calculate the updated state of `dp`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: *At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), for the loop to execute the first time `k` is between 1 and `s`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Also, `j` is greater than `k` and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
