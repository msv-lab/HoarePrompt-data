Postcondition: ***After not entering the if block and instead entering the else block, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
