According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `k` must be incremented within the range from 1 to `s`, and `j` must be greater than the updated value of `k`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) remains properly initialized, `j` is greater than `k+1`**
