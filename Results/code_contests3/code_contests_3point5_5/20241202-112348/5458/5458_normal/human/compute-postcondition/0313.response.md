Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. The values are converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user**
