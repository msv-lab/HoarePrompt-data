According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user. For the loop to execute, `n` and `m` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 1. In addition, the elements of the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) all need to be 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) with all elements being 0.
State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0**
