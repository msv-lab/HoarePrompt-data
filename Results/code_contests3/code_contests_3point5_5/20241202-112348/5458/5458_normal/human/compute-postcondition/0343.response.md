Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the overall state remains the same as the preconditions.***
