Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0. If `i` is 0, then this state is maintained. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at index [i+1 & 1][j+1][k] in dp is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, then the state remains unchanged. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
