Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). If `j >= k`, at the end of the iteration, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is set to 1. All other variables remain the same.***
