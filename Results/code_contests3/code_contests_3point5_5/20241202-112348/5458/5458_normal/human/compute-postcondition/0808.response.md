Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. For the loop to execute another time, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
