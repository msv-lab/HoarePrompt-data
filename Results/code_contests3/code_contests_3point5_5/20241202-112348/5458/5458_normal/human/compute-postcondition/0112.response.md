Postcondition: ***`i` is updated based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S`. `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is true, `i` remains updated based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S`, `m` is still greater than or equal to 1, `k` is still 1, `s` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Furthermore, `i` is still equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
