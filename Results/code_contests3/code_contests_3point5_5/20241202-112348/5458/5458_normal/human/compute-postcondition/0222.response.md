Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are appropriately initialized. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
