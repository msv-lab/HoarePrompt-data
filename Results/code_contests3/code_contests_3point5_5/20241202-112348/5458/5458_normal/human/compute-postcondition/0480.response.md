Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is adjusted such that it is less than `s`. Output State: No change in the state of the program, the program continues execution as normal.***
