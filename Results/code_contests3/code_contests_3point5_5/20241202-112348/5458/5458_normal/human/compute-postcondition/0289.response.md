Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 2`, `k` are integers initialized to 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are properly initialized. For the loop to start the first time, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
