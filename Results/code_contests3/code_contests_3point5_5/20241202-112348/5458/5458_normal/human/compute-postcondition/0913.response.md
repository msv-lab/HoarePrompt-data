Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 2, 1, and 1 respectively in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 2`, `k + 2`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 2`, `k + 2`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`**
