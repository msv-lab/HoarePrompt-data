Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `i + 1`, `k`, `dp` are not affected by this operation. The loop or if statement continues to the next iteration. After the if condition is executed, `j` is still greater than `k`. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `i + 1`, `k`, `dp` are integers. The loop or if statement continues to the next iteration. `j` is greater than `k` after the if condition is executed.**
