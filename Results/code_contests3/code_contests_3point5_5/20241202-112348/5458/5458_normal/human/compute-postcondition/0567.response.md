According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 (incremented by 1), for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
