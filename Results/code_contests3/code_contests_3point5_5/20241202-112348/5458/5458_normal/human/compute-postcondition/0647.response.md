Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j > k`, no variables change values and the loop continues to execute.***
