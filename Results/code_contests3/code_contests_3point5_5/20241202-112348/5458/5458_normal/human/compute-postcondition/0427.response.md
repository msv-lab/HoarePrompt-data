Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
