Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, in the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly based on the conditions stated in the program fragment.***
