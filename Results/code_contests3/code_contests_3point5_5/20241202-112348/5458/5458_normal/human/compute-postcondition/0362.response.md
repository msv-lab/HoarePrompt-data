Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[2][3][1] which are 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, where mod is not specified.**
