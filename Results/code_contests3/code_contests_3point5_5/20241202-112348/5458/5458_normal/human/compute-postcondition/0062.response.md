Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` is within the range 1 to S. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes a specific block of code, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
