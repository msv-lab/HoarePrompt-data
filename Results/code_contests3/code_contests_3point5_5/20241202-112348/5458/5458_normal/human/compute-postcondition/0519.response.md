According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, and `dp` is properly initialized. The final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and must satisfy the condition `i < n ** 2`.

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n ** 2`**
