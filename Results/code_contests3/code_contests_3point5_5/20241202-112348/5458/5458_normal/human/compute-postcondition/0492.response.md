Postcondition: ***After not entering the if block and instead entering the else block, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0. In addition, the value of `j` is greater than the value of `k`***
