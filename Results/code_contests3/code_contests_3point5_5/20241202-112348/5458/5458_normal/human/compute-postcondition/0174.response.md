Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+s`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+s]` is updated according to the conditions provided in the loop code. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+s]` will be set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k+s`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+s]` will be determined by the calculations within the loop. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to the value of `s`, updating the `dp` array accordingly.**
