Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are unknown, so the exact result cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is an integer and not equal to 0.
Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0**
