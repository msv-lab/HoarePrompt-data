Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are increased by 1 with specific values. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the modulo operation.**
