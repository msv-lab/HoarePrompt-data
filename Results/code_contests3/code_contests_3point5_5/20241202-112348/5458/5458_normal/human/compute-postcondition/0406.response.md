Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to k + 1. After the if else block, `dp[i + 2][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If `i` is 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If `i` is not 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the remainder of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by `mod`.***
