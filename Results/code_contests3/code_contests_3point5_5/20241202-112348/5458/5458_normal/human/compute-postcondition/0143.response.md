According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `k` is an integer, so no adjustment is needed for `k`. However, it is important to ensure that all the other variables are appropriately initialized:
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, for the loop to execute `s` is an integer and `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
