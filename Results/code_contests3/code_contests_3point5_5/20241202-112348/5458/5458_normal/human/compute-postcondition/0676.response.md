Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, and `k` is assigned a value of 1. The dimensions of `dp` are updated to (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). Therefore, the Output State is: At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`).
Output State: **At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`)**
