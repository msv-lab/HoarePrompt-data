Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. `j` is less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
