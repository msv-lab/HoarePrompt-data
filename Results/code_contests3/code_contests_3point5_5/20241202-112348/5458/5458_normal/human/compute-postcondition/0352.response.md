According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the loop can execute for any value of `k` within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. The initial loop will execute when `k` is 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
