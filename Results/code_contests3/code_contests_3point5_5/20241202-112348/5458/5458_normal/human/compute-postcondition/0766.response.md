Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the new value is stored in the specific position in the 2D list `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. After entering the if condition, `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
