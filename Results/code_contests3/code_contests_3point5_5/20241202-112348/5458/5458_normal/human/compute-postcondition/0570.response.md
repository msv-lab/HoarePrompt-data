Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 (incremented by 1), for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s. The specified assignment operation is executed on the `dp` list as described, where the values of `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` are utilized.**
