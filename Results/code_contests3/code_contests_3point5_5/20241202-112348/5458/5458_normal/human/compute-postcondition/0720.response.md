Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is adjusted based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`i` is adjusted based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k` should be less than or equal to `s`**
