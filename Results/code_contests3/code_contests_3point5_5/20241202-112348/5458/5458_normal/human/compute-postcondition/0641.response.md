Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, all variables remain the same, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
