Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the third time, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop continues without any changes to the variables.**
