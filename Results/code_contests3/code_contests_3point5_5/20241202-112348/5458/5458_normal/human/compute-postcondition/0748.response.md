Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the next time, `k` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected and the loop will continue executing with `k` being incremented by 1 and `s` remaining at least 1.***
