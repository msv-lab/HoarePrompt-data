Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be adjusted such that it is less than `s.` The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
