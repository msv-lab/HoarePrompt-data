Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`, while `i`, `j`, `k`, `m` are updated based on the loop conditions involving `j`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S`.**
