Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` is initialized appropriately, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` is initialized appropriately, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
