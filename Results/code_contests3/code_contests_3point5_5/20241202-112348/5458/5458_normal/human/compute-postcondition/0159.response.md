Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `i == 0`, otherwise it retains its previous calculated value. `s` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1. When `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`.**
