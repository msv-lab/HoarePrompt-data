Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2, `J` is increased by 1, `S` is greater than 0, `k` is the next value in the range `1` to `s`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
