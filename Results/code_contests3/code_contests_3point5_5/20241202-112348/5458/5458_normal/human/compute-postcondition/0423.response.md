Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is equal to 0 when the if condition is true, i + 1 evaluates to 1. The rest of the variables do not change based on this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s, j is between 1 and m, i is equal to 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **n, m, s, j is between 1 and m, i is equal to 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, j is greater than or equal to k**
