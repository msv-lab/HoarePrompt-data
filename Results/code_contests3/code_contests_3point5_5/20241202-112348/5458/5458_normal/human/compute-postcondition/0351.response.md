According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `m` should still be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1**.
