Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n`, `m`, `s` and the program continues its execution without any alterations to the values of the variables. Additionally, a 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(m + 2) x (s + 1)` with all elements initialized to 0.**
