Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain the same. For the loop to execute the third time, `s` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `j >= k`. If `i == 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
