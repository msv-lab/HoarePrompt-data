Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`. `dp` is a properly initialized 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). The final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s`, and `k` is 2 (incremented by 1). For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change in the variables, and the loop continues for the second iteration as per the specified condition.***
