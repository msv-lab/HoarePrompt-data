Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop will execute the first time when `m` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
