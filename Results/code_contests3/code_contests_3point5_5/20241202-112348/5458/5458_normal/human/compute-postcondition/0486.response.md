According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is between 1 and s. So for the loop to execute one more time, k should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is incremented by 1**
