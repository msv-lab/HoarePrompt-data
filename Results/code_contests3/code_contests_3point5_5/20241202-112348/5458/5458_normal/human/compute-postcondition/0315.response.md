Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers input from the user. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n`, `m`, `s` and the program continues its execution without any alterations to the values of the variables.***
