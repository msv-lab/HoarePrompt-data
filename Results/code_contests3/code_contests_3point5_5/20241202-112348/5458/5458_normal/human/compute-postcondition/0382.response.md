Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2 or greater than 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[2][3][2] which are 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
