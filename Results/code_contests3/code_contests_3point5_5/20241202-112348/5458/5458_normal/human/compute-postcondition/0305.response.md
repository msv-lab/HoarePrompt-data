Output State: **`i`, `j + 2`, `k` are integers initialized to 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are properly initialized. For the loop to start the third time, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `(dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod)`.**
