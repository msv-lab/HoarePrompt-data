Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. For the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` >= `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, all variables remain unchanged and the loop moves on to the next iteration.***
