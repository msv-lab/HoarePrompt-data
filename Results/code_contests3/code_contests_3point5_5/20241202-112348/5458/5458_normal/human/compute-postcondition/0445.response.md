Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The dimensions of the 2D list `dp` are also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i + 1` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and initialized properly, s is greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1**
