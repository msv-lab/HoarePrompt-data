Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with it. The specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided, so the output state is not determinable based on the given information.
Output State: **Output state is not determinable based on the given information**
