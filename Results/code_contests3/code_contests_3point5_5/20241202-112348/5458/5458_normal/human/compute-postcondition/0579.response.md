Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, and their final values are integers between 1 and `m`, `s`. The dimensions of `dp` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1**
