Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The dimensions of `dp` are (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0. Since `k` is incremented by 1, the value of `k` has changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, `k` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, `k` is incremented by 2**
