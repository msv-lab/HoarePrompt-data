Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is between 1 and `s`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.***
