Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 2`, `k` are integers initialized to 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are properly initialized. For the loop to start the second time, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
