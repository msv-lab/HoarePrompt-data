Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time `k` will be 1 and `s` will be at least 1. `i` will not be 0. If j > k, all variables will remain the same, and we will continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: *`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time `k` will be 1 and `s` will be at least 1. `i` will not be 0. If j > k, all variables will remain the same, and we will continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time `k` will be 1 and `s` will be at least 1. `i` will not be 0. If j > k, all variables will remain the same, and we will continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
