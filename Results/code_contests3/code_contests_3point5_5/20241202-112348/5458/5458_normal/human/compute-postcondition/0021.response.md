Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop will execute the first time when `m` is greater than 0. `i` is equal to 0. If the condition (j >= k) is true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If the condition (j < k) is true, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is updated to the sum of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
