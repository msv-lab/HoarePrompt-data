Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. The final output state will depend on the specific values of `i`, `j+1`, `k`, and `mod` after all iterations of the loop have completed.**
