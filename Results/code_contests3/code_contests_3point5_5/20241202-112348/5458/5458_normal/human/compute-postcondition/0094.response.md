Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The variables N, M + 1, S, J, and mod remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M + 1, S are positive integers. dp is a 2D list with updated values of dimensions (M+2) x (S+1) x 2. J is increased by 1 for the loop to execute, S is greater than 0, and k starts at 2. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated based on the modulo operation.
