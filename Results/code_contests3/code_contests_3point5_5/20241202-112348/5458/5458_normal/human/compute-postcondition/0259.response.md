Postcondition: ***All variables are appropriately initialized. `k` is incremented by 1, and the `dp` 2D list is updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop continues with the updated `k` and `dp` list. Otherwise, there is no change and the loop proceeds as usual.***
