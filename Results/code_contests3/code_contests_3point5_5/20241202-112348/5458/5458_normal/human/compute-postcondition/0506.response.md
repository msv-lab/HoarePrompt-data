Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: After the execution, the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated.
Output State: **After the execution, the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated**
