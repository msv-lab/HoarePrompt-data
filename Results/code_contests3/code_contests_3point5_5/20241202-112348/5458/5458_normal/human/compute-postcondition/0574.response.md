Example Answer: 
`k` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` becomes the previous value of `k` + 1. The calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is performed on the `dp` list based on the given formula. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **No change in variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j`; `k` is incremented by 1, and the specified calculation is performed on the `dp` list according to the given formula.**
