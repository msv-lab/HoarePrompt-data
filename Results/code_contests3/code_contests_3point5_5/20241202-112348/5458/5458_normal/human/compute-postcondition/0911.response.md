Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 2, 1, and 1 respectively, so the new values are `i + 3`, `j + 2`, and `k + 2`. The loop condition `k + 1` must still be less than or equal to `s`, so `k` is now at its limit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 3`, `j + 2`, `k` is at its limit, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 3`, `j + 2`, `k` is at its limit, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0**
