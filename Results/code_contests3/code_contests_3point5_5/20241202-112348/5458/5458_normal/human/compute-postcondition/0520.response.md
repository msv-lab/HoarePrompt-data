According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 each iteration and the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`. Additionally, since `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n` for the loop to execute, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted as well.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, `j` is less than `m`**
