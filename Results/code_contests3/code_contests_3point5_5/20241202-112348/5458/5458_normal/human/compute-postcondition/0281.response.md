Postcondition: ***`i`, `j + 2`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are appropriately initialized for further calculations, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is 1.***
