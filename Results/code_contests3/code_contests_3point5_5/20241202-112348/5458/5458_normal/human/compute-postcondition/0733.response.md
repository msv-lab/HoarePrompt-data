Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
