Postcondition: ***n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. The final values of j+1, i, k are integers between 1 and m. For the loop to execute one more time i is incremented by 1 and must be less than n. j is less than m, k is between 1 and s. If i is equal to 0 and j is greater than or equal to k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the modulo calculation. The loop or if statement continues to the next iteration, and j is greater than k after the if condition is executed.***
