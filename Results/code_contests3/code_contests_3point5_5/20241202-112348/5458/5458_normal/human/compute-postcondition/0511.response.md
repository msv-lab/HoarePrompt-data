Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` 2D list is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1**
