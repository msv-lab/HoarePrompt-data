Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S, `m`, `s` are all integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `i` is updated based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S. `m` remains greater than or equal to 1, `k` remains 1, `s` remains greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `i` remains equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S` continues to update `i`, `m`, `k`, and `j` according to the loop conditions. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
