Output State: **'k' is incremented by 1, 'dp' 2D list is updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. If 'j' is greater than 'k', 'k' is incremented by 1, 'dp' 2D list is updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. If 'i' is equal to 0, the loop continues with the updated 'k' and 'dp' list. If 'i' is not equal to 0 and 'j' is greater than 'k', 'k' is incremented by 1, 'dp' 2D list is updated based on the given formula, and the loop continues the execution.**
