Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
