Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` have specific values. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `k` is updated to be less than `s+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `1`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and further incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
