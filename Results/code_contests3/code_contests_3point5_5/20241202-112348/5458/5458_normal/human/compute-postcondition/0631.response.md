Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, the 2D list `dp` with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
