Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute again, `k` should be less than or equal to `s` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
