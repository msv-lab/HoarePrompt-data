Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. No change in the state occurs when `j` is greater than `k`, and the loop continues to execute.***
