According to the code, the loop can execute again for the next iteration if `k` is incremented within the range 1 to `s+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same. If `i == 0`, `k` is incremented to `k+1` within the range 1 to `s+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state should be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `dp`, `i` remain the same, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
