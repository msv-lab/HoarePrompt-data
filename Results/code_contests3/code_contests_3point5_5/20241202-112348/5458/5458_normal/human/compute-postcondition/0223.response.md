Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are all appropriately initialized. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
