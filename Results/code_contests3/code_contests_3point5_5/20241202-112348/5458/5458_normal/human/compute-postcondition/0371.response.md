Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] which is 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time. If j > k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
