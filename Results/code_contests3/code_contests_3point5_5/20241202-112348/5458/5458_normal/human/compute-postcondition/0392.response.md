Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 3, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2] and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1, for the loop to execute k is in the range 1 to s. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
