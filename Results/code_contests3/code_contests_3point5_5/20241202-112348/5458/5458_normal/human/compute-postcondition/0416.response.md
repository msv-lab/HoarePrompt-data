Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` are integers greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) where all elements are 0 except dp[1][2][2], and dp[m + 1][j + 1][2] which are 1. The values in dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are determined based on the conditions within the loop, with the final values reflecting the calculations made during each iteration of the loop.**
