According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and the condition `j >= k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` remain unchanged. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be less than `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`**
