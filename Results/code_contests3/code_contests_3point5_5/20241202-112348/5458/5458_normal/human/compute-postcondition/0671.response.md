Postcondition: ***At the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j+1` remain unchanged. `k` is still 1 and `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). For the loop to execute the first time, `k` is between 1 and `s`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, the variables remain the same, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.***
