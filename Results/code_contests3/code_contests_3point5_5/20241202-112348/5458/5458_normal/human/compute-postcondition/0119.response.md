Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are variables. After the execution of the if block where `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is updated based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to 0 after not entering the if block.***
