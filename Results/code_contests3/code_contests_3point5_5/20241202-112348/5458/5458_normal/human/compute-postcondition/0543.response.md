According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`. The final values of `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: *`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1*`.
