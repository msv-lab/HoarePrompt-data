Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, so their values remain the same. The dimensions of `dp` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
