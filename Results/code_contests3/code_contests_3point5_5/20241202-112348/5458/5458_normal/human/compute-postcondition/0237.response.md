Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of the variables do not change, but the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
