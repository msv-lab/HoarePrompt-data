Output State: **`i`, `j + 2`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are appropriately initialized for further calculations. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
