Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` remain the same. For the loop to execute the third time, `s` must still be greater than or equal to 1, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` must be updated accordingly. After the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
