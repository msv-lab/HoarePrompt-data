Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, so their values remain unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is adjusted based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k` should be less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`i` is adjusted based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k` should be less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
