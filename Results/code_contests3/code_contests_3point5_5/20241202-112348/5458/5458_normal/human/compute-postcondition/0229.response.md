Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `j`, `k+1`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are appropriately initialized. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
