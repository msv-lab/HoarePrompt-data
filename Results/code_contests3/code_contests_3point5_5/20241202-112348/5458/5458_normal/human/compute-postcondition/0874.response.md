Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the initial state of `j` is increased by 1 and `k` is 1, and the modulo operation is applied, the output state is affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is an integer with a specific value, value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on modulo operation**
