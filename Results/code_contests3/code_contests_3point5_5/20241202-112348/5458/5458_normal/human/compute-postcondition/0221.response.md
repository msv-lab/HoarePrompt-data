Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, but based on the operation `%` being performed, it can be inferred that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is divided by `mod` and the remainder is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m` are appropriately initialized. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
