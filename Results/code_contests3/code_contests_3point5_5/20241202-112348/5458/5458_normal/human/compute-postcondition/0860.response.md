Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `If j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.
Output State: **If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described**
