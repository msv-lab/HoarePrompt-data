Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, and the dimensions of `dp` are properly initialized. The final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are also within the specified range. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) is properly initialized, the final values of `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
