According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). If `j >= k`, the loop executed with `k` set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be increased by 1 and remain less than or equal to `s`.
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`)**
