Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are known to be integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the calculated value.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the calculated value**
