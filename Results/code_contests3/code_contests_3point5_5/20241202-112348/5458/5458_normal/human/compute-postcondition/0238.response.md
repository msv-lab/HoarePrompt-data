Postcondition: ***All variables i, j, k+1, mod, N, M, S, m are appropriately initialized. s is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If j >= k, the value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be incremented within the range from 1 to s. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
