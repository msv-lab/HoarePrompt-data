According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is incremented by 1 based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S to update the values in the `dp` 2D list. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`i` is updated based on the loop logic involving `j`, `k`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, and `S, `m` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
