Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
