Postcondition: ***`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 2`, `k + 2`, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`, if `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
