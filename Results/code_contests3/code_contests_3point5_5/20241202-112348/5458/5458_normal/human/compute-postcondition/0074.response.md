According to the loop logic, the loop will execute for all values of `k` within the range 1 to S. At the end of the previous iteration, `N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers. The 2D list `dp` is initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be incremented by 1 as the loop iterates over the range from 1 to M+1.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. 
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration will be:
State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2, `j` increased by 1**.
