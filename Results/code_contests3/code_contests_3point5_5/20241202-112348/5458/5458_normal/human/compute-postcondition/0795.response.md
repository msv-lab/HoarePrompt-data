According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j+1` is equal to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers, for the loop to execute another time `j` should be less than `m`**
