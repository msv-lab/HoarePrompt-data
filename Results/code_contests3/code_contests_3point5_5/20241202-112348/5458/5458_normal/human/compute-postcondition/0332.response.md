According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1
- The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be calculated based on the provided conditions
- All other states remain the same

State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and all elements are 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be incremented by 1**.
