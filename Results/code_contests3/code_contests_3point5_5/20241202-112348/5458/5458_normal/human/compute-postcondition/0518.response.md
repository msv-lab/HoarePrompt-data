Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized. The final values of the variables `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`. The final state will reflect the cumulative changes made to the variables based on the loop logic, including the conditions `j >= k` and `j > k`.**
