Postcondition: ***`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 1`, `k` starts at 1, `dp + 1`, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if j is greater or equal to k. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
