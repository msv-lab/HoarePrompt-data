Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 0, i + 1 & 1 will result in 1. The values of j and k are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s are integers between 1 and m. dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) and properly initialized. j+1, i, k are integers between 1 and m. s is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, j is greater than or equal to k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.
