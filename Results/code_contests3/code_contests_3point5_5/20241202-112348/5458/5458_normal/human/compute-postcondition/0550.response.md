Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`.
Output State: **`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `j+1`, `i+1`, `k+1` are integers between 1 and `m`**
