Output State: **`n, m, s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1, i, k` are integers between 1 and `m`. If `j > k`, there is no change in the variables. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
