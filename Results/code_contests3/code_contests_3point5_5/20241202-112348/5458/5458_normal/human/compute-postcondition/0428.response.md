Example Answer:
The code snippet contains a `continue` statement which will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i`, `dp`, and `k` remain unchanged**
