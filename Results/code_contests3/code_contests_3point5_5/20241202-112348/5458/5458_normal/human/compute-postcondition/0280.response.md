Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the updated value is stored in `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`i`, `j + 2`, `k` is 1, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `dp` 2D list are appropriately initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is 1.**
