Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is adjusted such that it is less than `s.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is adjusted such that it is less than `s**
