Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected. After execution, the state of `dp` is updated based on the previous value at index `j` for the updated index `j + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) properly initialized, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
