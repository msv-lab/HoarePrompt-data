Postcondition: ***`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. For the loop to execute one more time `k + 2` is within the range 1 to S. If i == 0 and j >= k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 and `j > k`, the program follows the initial conditions. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
