Output State: **After the if-else block executes, the program variables are as follows: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers between 1 and `m`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) and properly initialized, `j+1`, `i`, `k` are integers between 1 and `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is between 1 and `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. If the condition (i == 0) is met, `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, with `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1. Otherwise, after executing the code, the value of `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of the value of `dp` at position [i & 1][j][k - j].**
