Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values returned by splitting the input string into integers using `map`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
