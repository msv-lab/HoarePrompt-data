According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to `k + 1` and it should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2, `dp` is properly initialized with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`), for the loop to execute the second time `k` is between 1 and `s`**
