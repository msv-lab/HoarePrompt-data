Output State: **`N`, `M + 1`, `S` are positive integers. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (m+2) x (s+1) x 2. The loop will execute for all values of `k` within the range 1 to S. The values of `j`, `i`, and `mod` may be updated based on the loop logic. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
