Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `mod`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `m`, `s` are integers. When `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is updated with 1. If `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`. In the if part, when `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The loop executes if `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `i != 0` and `j > k`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. `s` is an integer and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`***
