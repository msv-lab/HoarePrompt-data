According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the variables `n, m, i, j, k, dp` are not directly related to the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, the loop variable `k` needs to be adjusted to start at 1 for the loop to execute.
State: **`n + 1`, `m + 1`, `s + 1`, `i + 2`, `j + 1`, `k` starts at 1, `dp + 1`, for the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0**
