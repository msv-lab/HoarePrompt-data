Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained by splitting the input. The index `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains updated tuple values, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains updated tuple values, `i` is incremented by 1**
