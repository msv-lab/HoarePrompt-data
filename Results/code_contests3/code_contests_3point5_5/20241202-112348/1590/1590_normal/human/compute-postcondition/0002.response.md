According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `s` is a positive integer. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
