Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `fi` and `ti` are extracted from the input and stored in their respective variables. `p` appends a new tuple of `(fi, ti)` values. The value of `i` remains 2, and `n` is greater than 1, and `s` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a tuple of `(fi, ti)` values obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `p` appends a new tuple of `(fi, ti)` values.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a tuple of `(fi, ti)` values obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input, `p` appends a new tuple of `(fi, ti)` values**.
