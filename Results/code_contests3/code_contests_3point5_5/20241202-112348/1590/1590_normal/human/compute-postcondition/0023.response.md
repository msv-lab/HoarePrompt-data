Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in list `p`, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with the addition of the tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1. After the if statement, `time_passed` is less than the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1`, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in list `p`.**
