The code appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. As `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, adding `(0, 0)` will not change the sorting order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with the addition of the tuple (0, 0).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with the addition of the tuple (0, 0)**
