According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a tuple of `(fi, ti)` values obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a tuple of `(fi, ti)` values obtained from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1**
