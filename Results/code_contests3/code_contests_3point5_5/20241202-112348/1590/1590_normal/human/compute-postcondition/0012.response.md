Example Answer:
The list of tuples `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The original order of the list `p` is changed accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order**
