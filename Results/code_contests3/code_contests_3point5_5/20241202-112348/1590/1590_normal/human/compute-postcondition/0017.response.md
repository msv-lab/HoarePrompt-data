Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order with the addition of the tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the tuple at index `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
