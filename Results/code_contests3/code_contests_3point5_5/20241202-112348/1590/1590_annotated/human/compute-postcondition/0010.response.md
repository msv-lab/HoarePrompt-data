Example Answer:
A tuple containing the values of the current passenger's arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown, but they are positive integers within the specified range. The list `p` now contains an additional tuple. The value of `i` remains 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 3**
