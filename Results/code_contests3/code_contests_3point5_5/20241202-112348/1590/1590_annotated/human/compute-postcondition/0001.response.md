Example Answer:
The list `p` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000. Each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000. Each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` is an empty list**
