Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `s` is updated based on the sublist at index `i` in `p` where `i` is 2, `time_passed` is updated based on each iteration. If `time_passed` is less than the second element of the sublist at index 2 in `p`, then the program continues to update `s` and `time_passed`. Otherwise, the program does not update `s` and `time_passed`.***
