Example Answer: 
fi and ti are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of fi and ti are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 1, fi and ti are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input**
