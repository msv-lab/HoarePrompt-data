Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned values extracted from the input split using `map` and `int`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are positive integers within the specified range. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 3**
