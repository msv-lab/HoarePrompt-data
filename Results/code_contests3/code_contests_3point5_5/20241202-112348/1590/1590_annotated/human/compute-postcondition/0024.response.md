Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated based on the calculation `p[i][1] - time_passed`. The previous values of `time_passed` and `p` are known, so the new value of `time_passed` can be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is updated based on the condition and calculations in the loop body, `p` is updated based on the conditions and calculations in the loop body, `i` is 1, `time_passed` is updated based on each iteration**
