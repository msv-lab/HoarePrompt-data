Example Answer:
The variable `time_passed` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `i` is equal to n, `time_passed` is 0**
