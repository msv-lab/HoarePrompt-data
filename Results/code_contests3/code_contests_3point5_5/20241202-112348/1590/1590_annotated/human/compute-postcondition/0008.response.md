According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 2. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple with values assigned from the input split, `i` is 3**.
