Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor fi and time ti are positive integers such that 1 <= fi <= s and 1 <= ti <= 1000, p contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order with an additional tuple (0, 0), i is 0, time_passed is updated based on each iteration, where time_passed is incremented by s - p[i][0], s is updated based on the value of p[i][0]. In addition, time_passed is less than p[i][1] after the if condition is met, and time_passed is updated to p[i][1].**
