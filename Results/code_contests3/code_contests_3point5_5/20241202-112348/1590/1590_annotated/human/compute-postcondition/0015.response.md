According to the code, the loop will execute `n + 1` times. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `i` should iterate from 0 to n inclusive, so adjust to `i` is 0 at the start.
- `time_passed` should be updated based on the time passed in each iteration of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `i` is 0, `time_passed` is updated based on each iteration**
