Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. Since `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order, the new tuple `(0, 0)` will still maintain the sorted order. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `i` is equal to n.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `i` is equal to n**
