Example Answer:
The list of passengers `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The previous values of `p` and other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order, `i` is equal to n.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the sorted list of passengers based on arrival floor in descending order, `i` is equal to n**
