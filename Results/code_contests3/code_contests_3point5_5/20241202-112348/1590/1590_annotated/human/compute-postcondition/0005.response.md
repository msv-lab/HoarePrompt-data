According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` is 2**
