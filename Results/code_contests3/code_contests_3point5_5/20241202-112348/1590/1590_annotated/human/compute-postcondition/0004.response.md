Example Answer:
`(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input. The list `p` now contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, each passenger arrival floor `fi` and time `ti` are positive integers such that 1 <= `fi` <= s and 1 <= `ti` <= 1000, `p` contains the appended tuple, `i` is 1**
