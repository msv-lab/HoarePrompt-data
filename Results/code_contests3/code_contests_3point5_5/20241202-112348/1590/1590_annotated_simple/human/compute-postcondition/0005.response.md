According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is a list containing a tuple of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0. Since the loop increases `i` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is a list containing a tuple of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
