Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The function `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it based on spaces. Then `map(int, ...)` converts the split values to integers and assigns them to `n` and `s`. The values of `n` and `s` are between 1 and 100 for `n` and between 1 and 1000 for `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000**
