Example Answer:
Since `p` is assigned an empty list, the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is an empty list**
