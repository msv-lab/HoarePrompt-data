Postcondition: ***`time_passed` is updated based on the difference between `p[i][1]` and its initial value. `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]` for the loop to execute one more time. If `time_passed` is less than the new `p[i][1]` value, the loop will execute again with the updated values of `time_passed` and `s`.***
