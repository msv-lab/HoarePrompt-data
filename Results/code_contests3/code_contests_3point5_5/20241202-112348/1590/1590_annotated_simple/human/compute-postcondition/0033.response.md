The function `func` accepts no parameters. The function is responsible for managing the arrival times and floor values of passengers in a building. The function should handle the following constraints: n and s are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000. Each passenger's arrival time and floor values are integers such that 1 <= fi <= s, 1 <= ti <= 1000.

Functionality: **The function manages the arrival times and floor values of passengers in a building, adhering to the constraints provided.**
