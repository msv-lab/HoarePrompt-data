According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
