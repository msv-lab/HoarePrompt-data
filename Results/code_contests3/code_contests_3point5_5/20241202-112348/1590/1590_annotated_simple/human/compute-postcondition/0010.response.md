Example Answer:
The tuple (fi, ti) is appended to the list p. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained by splitting the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n`, `s`, `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 3, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 3, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input**
