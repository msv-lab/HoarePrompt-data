Example Answer:
`p` is appended with a new tuple `(fi, ti)`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from the input split. The loop will execute a second time, so `i` will be 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 <= s <= 1000, `p` contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
