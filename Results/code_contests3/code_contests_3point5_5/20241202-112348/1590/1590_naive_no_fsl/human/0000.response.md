Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of n and s.
2. It then reads each passenger's floor and arrival time and stores them in a list of tuples.
3. The list of passengers is sorted based on their floor numbers in descending order.
4. The program iterates through each passenger and calculates the time taken to reach that passenger's floor from the current floor.
5. If the time taken is less than the passenger's arrival time, it updates the time taken to wait for the passenger.
6. Finally, the total time taken to bring all passengers to floor 0 is printed.

The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
