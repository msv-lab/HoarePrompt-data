Postcondition: ***`t` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`. Otherwise, no change occurs in the state of the variables.***
