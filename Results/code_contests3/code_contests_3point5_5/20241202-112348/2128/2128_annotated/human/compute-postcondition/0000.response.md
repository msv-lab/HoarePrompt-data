Example Answer:
t is assigned the value of int(sys.stdin.readline()), where sys.stdin.readline() reads an input line from the standard input. Since t is an integer within the specified range, the value of t remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer within the specified range.
Output State: **t is an integer within the specified range**
