Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order as specified by `sorted(arr, reverse=True)`. The previous values of the variables are maintained as they are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer within the specified range, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is an integer within the specified range, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
