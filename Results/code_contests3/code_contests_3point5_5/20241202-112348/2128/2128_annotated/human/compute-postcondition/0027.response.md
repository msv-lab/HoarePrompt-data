Output State: **`t` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be incremented by 1, `ans` is further incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`.**
