Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from mapping integers from the input. The input is read from `sys.stdin.readline()` and split by space. Since the initial state of `t` is not mentioned, we assume `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer within the specified range, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input.
Output State: **`t` is an integer within the specified range, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from input**
