Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order and `l` is less than `k`, the value of `arr[l]` is added to `ans`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `ans` will be the sum of the first element of `arr`, `arr[l]`, and the current value of `ans`. 
Output State: **`t` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is greater than or equal to `l + 1`, new value of `ans` includes the sum of the first element of `arr`, `arr[l]`, and the previous value of `ans`.**
