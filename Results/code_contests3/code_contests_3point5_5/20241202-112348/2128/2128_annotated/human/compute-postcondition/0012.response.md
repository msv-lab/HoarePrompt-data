Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the sum of the first element of `arr` and the element at index `l`. Since the value of `ans` is unknown before this operation, the new value of `ans` will depend on the value of the first element of `arr` and the element at index `l`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k adjusted based on conditions`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the sum of the first element of `arr` and the element at index `l`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k adjusted based on conditions`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the sum of the first element of `arr` and the element at index `l`**
