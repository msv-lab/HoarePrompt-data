Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers within the specified ranges, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the first element of `arr` plus the element at index `l`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`.**
