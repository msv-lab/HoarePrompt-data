Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is already assigned a value from the input. The value of `k` will be one less than the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is assigned a value from the input, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is assigned a value from the input, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is 1**
