According to the code, for the loop to execute, the loop variable `l` must be in the range of 1 to k inclusive. Therefore, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, the following adjustments need to be made to the state:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value from the input, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element in `arr`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute `l` is in the range of 1 to k**.
