Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0. If k is greater or equal to n, then `n` is assigned a value from the input, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element in `arr`, and `i` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
