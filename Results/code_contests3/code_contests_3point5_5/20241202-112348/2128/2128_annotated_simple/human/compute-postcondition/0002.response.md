Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting them. The values are obtained from the standard input. The initial state mentions that `t` is greater than 0, but it is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the standard input.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the standard input**
