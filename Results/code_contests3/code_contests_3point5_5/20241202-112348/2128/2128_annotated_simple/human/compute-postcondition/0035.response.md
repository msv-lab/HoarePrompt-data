Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. Since `arr` is already sorted in descending order, the order remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting**
