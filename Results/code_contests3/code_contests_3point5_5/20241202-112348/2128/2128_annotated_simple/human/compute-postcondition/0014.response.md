Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[2]` is the third element in the list. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by the value of the third element in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr` plus the value of the third element in `arr`, `l` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the value of the third element in `arr`**
