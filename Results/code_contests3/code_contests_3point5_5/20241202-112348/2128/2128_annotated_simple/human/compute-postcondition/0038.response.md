Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program retains the initial state mentioned in the precondition.***
