The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It performs a series of test cases where each test case consists of integers `n`, `k`, and a list of integers `a_i`. The constraints for these parameters are defined as follows: 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2*10^5 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function does not return any specific output as the description only provides the constraints and relationships between the input parameters for each test case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to take in multiple test cases with specified constraints for `n`, `k`, and `a_i` without returning any specific output.
