Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` will be as follows: `t` will be the same as the input value, `n` will be assigned a value from the input, `k` will be one less than `n`, `arr` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` will be the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`, and `i` will be equal to `t`.**
