Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr` plus the value of `arr[2] after the addition, for the loop to execute a second time `l` must be 2, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l] where l is now 2**
