According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variables `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 to 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`, `i` is 2**
