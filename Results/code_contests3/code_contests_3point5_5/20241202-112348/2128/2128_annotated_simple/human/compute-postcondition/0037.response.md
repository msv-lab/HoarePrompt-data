Example Answer:
The value of `k` is updated to be `n - 1`. Since `k` was already one less than `n`, after this update, `k` remains the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `k` is one less than `n`, `n` is assigned a value, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is one less than `n`, `n` is assigned a value, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the first element of `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting**
