Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and the element at index `l`, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting, for the loop to execute the second time `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` in `arr`.**
