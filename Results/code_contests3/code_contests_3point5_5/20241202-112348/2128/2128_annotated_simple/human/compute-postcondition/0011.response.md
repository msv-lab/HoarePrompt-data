According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr` plus the value of `arr[l] after the addition. Since `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr` plus the value of `arr[2] after the addition, for the loop to execute a second time `l` must be 2**
