Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input and then for each test case within the range of `t`, it reads integers `n` and `k`, as well as a list of integers `a_i`. It sorts the list `a_i` in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the sorted list, and prints this sum. The function ensures that `k` is less than `n-1`. The constraints for the input parameters are specified. The function does not return any value but processes multiple test cases as described.**
