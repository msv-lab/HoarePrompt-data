Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from standard input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from standard input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
