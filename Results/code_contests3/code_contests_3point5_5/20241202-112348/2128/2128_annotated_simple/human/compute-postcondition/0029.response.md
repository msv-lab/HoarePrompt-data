Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is assigned a value, `k` is one less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and second element in `arr` plus the value of `arr[l]` where `l` is in the range of 1 to k+2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `l` must be increased by 1, `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`**
