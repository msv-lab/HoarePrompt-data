According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of the first `k` + 1 elements in `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 1**.
