Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of test cases, the number of barrels, the number of pourings allowed, and the initial amount of water in each barrel. It then sorts the barrels in descending order based on the initial amount of water. It calculates the maximum possible difference by summing the first k+1 elements of the sorted array. The program correctly handles the case where the number of pourings allowed is greater than or equal to the number of barrels.

The program follows the problem description and calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels after the specified number of pourings.
