Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the standard input and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers into `arr`. It sorts `arr` in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements, and prints the result. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is adjusted to `n - 1`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
