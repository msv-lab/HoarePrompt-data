Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. The value of `ans` is updated based on the initial values of `ans` and `arr[l]`. Since the initial state is not provided, the final output state will depend on the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` at runtime.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` at runtime**
