Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. To execute the loop one more time, `l` should be incremented by 1 and `l` should be less than `k`. The specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` are not given, so the output state is: Dependent on the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` at runtime, `l` may be incremented by 1 and `l` may be less than `k`.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` at runtime, `l` may be incremented by 1 and `l` may be less than `k`**
