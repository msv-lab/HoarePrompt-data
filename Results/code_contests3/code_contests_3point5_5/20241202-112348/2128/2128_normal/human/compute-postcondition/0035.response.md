Example Answer: 
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `arr`, `n`, or `k`, we cannot calculate the specific new values of `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, and `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
