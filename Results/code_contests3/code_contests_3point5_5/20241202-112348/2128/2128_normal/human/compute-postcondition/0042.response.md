Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The loop condition states that `l` must be incremented for the loop to execute one more time. After execution, the state of the variables will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans` are integers, `l` is incremented, `k` is less than `n - 1` or updated to `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`**
