Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping the input integers separated by a space from the standard input. The values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `n` and `k` are input integers obtained from splitting the standard input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `n` and `k` are input integers obtained from splitting the standard input**
