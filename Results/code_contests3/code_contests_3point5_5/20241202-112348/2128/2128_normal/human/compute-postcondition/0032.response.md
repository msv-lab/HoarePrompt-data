According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the value of `t` should remain the same.
State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `ans` is printed.**
