Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the first loop iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers derived from splitting the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of the modified sorted `arr` list + the value of `arr[l]`. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `l` is 1**
