Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the first loop iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers derived from splitting the standard input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of the sorted `arr` list. If k >= n, then k is assigned the value of n - 1.***
