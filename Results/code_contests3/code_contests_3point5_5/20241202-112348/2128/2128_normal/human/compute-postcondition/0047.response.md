Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted `arr` list. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The sum of the first `k` elements of the sorted `arr` list is printed for each iteration of the loop.**
