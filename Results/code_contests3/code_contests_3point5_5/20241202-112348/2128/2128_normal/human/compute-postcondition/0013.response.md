Since the loop is iterating over the range from 1 to k + 1, the loop execution depends on the values of `l` and `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` will determine whether the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **Dependent on the specific values of `ans` and `arr[l]` at runtime, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be incremented by 1 and `l` should be less than `k`**
