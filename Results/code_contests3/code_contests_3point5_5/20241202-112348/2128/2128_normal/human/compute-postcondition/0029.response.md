Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of the sorted `arr` list plus the value at index `l` of `arr`, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `n` and if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of `arr`.**
