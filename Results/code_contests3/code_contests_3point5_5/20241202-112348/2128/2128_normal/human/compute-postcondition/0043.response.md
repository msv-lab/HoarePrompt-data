According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans` are integers, `l` is incremented, `k` is less than `n - 1` or updated to `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than `n - 1` again.
State: **`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `ans` are integers, `l` is incremented, `k` is less than `n - 1` or updated to `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than `n - 1`**
