Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is in `memo` and `memo[c]` is 1, then it becomes 2. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is created with a value of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0 for the loop to execute one more time where `memo[c]` is now 0 if `c` is not in `memo, `memo[c]` has been updated.
