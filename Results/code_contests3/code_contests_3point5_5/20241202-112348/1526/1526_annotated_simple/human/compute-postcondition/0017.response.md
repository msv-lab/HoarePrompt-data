According to the code, the loop can execute if the dictionary `memo` has at least 1 unique key. Before the loop starts, the `memo` dictionary having at least 1 unique key is the only condition necessary for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `memo` has at least 1 unique key.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with keys as unique characters from `s` and values as the frequency of those characters in `s`, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `memo` has at least 1 unique key**
