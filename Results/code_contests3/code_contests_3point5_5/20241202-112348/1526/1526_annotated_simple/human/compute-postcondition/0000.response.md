Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user. Since the initial state is `w is a string consisting of lowercase letters`, the value of `s` will also be a string consisting of lowercase letters. Therefore, the Output State is: `w is a string consisting of lowercase letters`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters.
Output State: **`w is a string consisting of lowercase letters`, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters**
