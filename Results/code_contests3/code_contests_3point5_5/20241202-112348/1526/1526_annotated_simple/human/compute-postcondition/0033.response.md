Functionality: **The function func_1 reads a string `s` from user input, creates a dictionary `memo` with the frequency of each unique character in the string, and then checks if all character frequencies in `memo` are even. If all frequencies are even, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
