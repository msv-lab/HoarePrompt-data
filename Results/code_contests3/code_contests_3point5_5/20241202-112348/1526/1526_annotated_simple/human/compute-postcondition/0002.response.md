According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the string `s` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the string `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, so it should be adjusted to `s` is not an empty string. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`, the character `c` should be the first character of the string `s`. Finally, the `memo` dictionary is empty before the loop starts, so it should remain empty.
State: **`w is a string consisting of lowercase letters`, `s` is not an empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in `s`**
