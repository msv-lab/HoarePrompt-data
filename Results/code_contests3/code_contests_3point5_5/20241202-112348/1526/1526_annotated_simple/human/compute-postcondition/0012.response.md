Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `memo[c]` can be either 1 or 0. After execution, the value of `memo[c]` is now 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0 for the loop to execute one more time where `memo[c]` is now 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0 for the loop to execute one more time where `memo[c]` is now 0**
