According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value 1, `c` is the first character in `s`, and `c` is added to `memo` with a value of 1. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still have characters left after the current character `c` has been processed. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value 1, `c` is the next character in `s`**
