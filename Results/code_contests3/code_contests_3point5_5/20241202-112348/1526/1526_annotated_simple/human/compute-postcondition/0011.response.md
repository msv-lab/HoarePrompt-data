According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` that still has characters to iterate over. If there are more characters in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not empty, and `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in `s` to iterate over.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
