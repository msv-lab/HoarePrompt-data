Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value 1, `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo` is updated with key `c` and value 0. Otherwise, no change occurs in the values of the variables.***
