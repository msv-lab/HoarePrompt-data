Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo` is updated with key `c` and value 0. Otherwise, the value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0, depending on the previous state of `c`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is not an empty string with characters remaining to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value either 1 or 0**
