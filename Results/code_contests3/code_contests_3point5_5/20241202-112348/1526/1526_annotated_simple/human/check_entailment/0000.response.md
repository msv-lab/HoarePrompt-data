Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly determines if a given string `w` is beautiful based on the problem description. It counts the frequency of each character in the string `w` and then checks if all the frequencies are even. If any frequency is odd, it sets the result to False and breaks out of the loop. Finally, it prints "Yes" if result is True (indicating all frequencies are even) and "No" otherwise.

The program handles all possible cases where a string `w` is considered beautiful or not beautiful based on the problem description. It correctly follows the logic of checking if each lowercase letter occurs an even number of times in the string `w`.
