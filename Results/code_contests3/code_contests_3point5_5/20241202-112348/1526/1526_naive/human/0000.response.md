Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input string w, counts the occurrences of each character in a dictionary, and then checks if the count of each character is even. If any character count is odd, it sets the result to False. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' if the result is False. 
The program handles all lowercase letters and checks if they occur even number of times in the input string, which aligns with the problem description. 
Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of determining if the given string is beautiful.
