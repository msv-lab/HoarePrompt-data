Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string, counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter, and checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If all letters occur an even number of times, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, it correctly determines if the input string is beautiful or not.
