The function `func_1` reads an input string `w` consisting of lowercase letters. It then creates a dictionary `memo` where each character in `w` is a key, and the value is the number of occurrences of that character in the input string. Subsequently, it checks if all the values in `memo` are even. If all values are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, it may not handle edge cases where the input string is empty or contains non-lowercase characters.
