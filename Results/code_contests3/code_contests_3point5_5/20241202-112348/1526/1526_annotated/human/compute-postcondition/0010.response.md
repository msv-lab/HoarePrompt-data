Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is increased by 1. The value of `memo[c]` can be either 0 or some previous value increased by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 0 or increased by 1 for the next character c.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 0 or increased by 1 for the next character c.**
