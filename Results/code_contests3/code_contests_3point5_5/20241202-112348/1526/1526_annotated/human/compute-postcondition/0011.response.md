According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters left, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 0 or increased by 1 for the next character c. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must still have characters left.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 0 or increased by 1 for the next character c**.
