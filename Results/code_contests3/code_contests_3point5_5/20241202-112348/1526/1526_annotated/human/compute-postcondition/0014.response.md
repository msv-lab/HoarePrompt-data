Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is increased by 1. If `memo[c]` was 0 for the previous character `c`, it will now be 1 for the next character `c`. If `memo[c]` was already increased by 1 for the previous character `c`, it will be further incremented by 1 for the next character `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 1 or increased by 2 for the next character `c`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is either 1 or increased by 2 for the next character `c`**
