According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the string s is not empty. Before the loop starts, the string s is provided as input. So for the loop to execute the first time, memo will be an empty dictionary, c will be the first character in string s, and w will remain unchanged.
State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a raw input string, memo is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time c is the first character in string s**
