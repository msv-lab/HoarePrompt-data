According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least one value, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed, the dictionary `memo` must have at least one value, and `x` is the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in the dictionary**
