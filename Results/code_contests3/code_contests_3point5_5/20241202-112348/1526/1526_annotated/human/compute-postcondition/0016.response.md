Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `True`. There are no changes to the initial state of the variables `w`, `s`, and `memo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character in `w` is a key and its value is the number of occurrences of that character in the input string `s`, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each character in `w` is a key and its value is the number of occurrences of that character in the input string `s`, `result` is True**
