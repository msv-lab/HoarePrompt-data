Example Answer:
The value of memo[c] is incremented by 1. If c is not in the keys of memo, memo will have the key c with a value of 0. Therefore, after execution, the value of memo[c] will be either 1 (if c was not in the keys of memo initially) or increased by 1 (if c was already in the keys of memo with a value greater than 0).
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a raw input string, memo is a dictionary where memo[c] is either 1 or increased by 1**
