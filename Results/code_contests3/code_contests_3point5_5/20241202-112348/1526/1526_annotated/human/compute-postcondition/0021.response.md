Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True. For the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in the dictionary. If the value of `x` is odd (x % 2 > 0), then the `result` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
