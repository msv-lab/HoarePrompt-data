Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. Since `c` is the first character in string `s`, `c` is the first character in the string. Therefore, after execution, `memo` has the key `c` with a value of 0.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a raw input string, memo is a dictionary with c not in its keys. memo has the key c with a value of 0**
