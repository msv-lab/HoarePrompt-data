According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values in the dictionary, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True, `x` is the second value in the dictionary. If x % 2 > 0, `result` is False and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the dictionary `memo` must have more than one value, and `x` should be the next value in the dictionary after the current `x`. 
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with more than one value, `result` is True, `x` is the next value in the dictionary after the current `x`**
