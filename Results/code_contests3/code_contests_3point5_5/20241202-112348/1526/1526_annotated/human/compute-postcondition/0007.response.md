According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in the input string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered, and memo[c] needs to be updated accordingly.
State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s still has characters left, memo[c] is either 1 or increased by 1 for the next character c**
