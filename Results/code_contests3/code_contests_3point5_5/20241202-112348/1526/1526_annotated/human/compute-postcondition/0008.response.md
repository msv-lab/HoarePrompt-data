Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0, which means the count for character `c` is reset to 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is now 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` still has characters left, `memo[c]` is now 0**
