Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly determines whether the input string `w` is beautiful by checking if each lowercase letter occurs an even number of times. It achieves this by creating a dictionary `memo` where each character in `w` is a key, and the value is the number of occurrences of that character in the input string. Then, it checks if all the values in `memo` are even. If all values are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This approach aligns with the problem description and ensures that the program correctly identifies beautiful strings.
