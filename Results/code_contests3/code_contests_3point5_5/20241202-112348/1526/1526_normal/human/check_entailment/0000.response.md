Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an input string `w` and creates a dictionary `memo` to store the frequency of each character.
- It then iterates over the values in `memo` and checks if any character has an odd frequency. If it finds any odd frequency, it sets `result` to False.
- Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is True (indicating all characters have even frequencies) and 'No' otherwise.
- The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines if the input string `w` is beautiful by checking if each lowercase letter occurs an even number of times.
- The output hints also confirm that the code is working as expected, as they describe the same logic applied in the code to determine if the string is beautiful.
