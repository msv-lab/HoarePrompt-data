At the end of the last iteration, the loop was iterating over the values of the dictionary `memo`. The loop breaks out if `x` % 2 > 0 and `result` becomes False. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that the value of `x` in the next iteration does not lead to `result` becoming False. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, and `result` is True.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is True for the loop to execute another time**
