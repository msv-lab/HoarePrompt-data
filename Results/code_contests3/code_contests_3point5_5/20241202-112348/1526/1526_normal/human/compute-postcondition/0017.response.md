According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If `memo` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and `memo` is a dictionary, so for the loop to execute the first time, `memo` should not be empty. Additionally, since `result` is True, it does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time**
