According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, w is a string consisting of lowercase letters does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string and `c` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a non-empty string and `c` is the first character in `s`**
