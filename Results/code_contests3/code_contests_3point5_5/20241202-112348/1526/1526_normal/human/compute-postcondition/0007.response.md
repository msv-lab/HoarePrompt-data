According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in the string `s`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with `c` being the first character, and if c is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is 0. After executing the code, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `s` should be considered. So, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with the next character after `c`, if the next character is not in `memo`, `memo[next_character]` is 0.**
