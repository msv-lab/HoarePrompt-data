Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value True. The variables `w` and `memo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary where keys are the characters in `w` and values are the frequency of each character in `w`, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary where keys are the characters in `w` and values are the frequency of each character in `w`, `result` is True**
