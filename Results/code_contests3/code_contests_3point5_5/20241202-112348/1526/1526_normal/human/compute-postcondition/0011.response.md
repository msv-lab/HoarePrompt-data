According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`, current character `c`, and the dictionary `memo`. If there are more characters in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with the next character after `c`, if the next character is not in `memo`, `memo[next_character]` is 0. After the execution of the if statement, if `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is assigned the value 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character after the current character `c` in `s` should be available, and the corresponding value in `memo` should be set to 0.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with the next character after `c`, if the next character is not in `memo`, `memo[next_character]` is 0. After the execution of the if statement, if c is not in memo, memo[c] is assigned the value 1**.
