Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The initial states show that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with `c` being the first character, and `c` is not in `memo`. After execution, the output state will be: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with `c` being the first character, `c` is not in `memo`, and `memo[c]` is 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with `c` being the first character, `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is 0**
