Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
