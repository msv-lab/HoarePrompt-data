Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False. The value of `result` depends on whether there exists an odd frequency of a character in the string `w` according to the dictionary `memo`. Since the initial state specifies that `result` is False if there exists an odd frequency of a character in `w` according to `memo`, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary, `result` is False if there exists an odd frequency of a character in `w` according to `memo`, otherwise `result` remains True**
