The function `func_1` reads an input string `w` consisting of lowercase letters. It then creates a dictionary `memo` where keys are the characters in `w` and values represent the frequency of each character. The function checks if there exists an odd frequency of any character in `w` and prints 'Yes' if all frequencies are even, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
