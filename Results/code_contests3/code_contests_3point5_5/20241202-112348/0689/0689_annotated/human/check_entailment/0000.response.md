Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two strings, S and T, and checks if any rotation of string T matches string S. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This is exactly what the problem description asks for, so the program is correct.
