Functionality: **The function `func` reads two strings, S and T, from user input. It then checks if any rotation of string T matches string S. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value. The strings S and T consist of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100 inclusive.**
