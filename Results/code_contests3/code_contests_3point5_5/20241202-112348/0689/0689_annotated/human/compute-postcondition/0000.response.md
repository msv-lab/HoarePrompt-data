Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes input as a string. Since the initial state mentions that S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100 inclusive, the output state is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100 inclusive; `s` is assigned the input string.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100 inclusive; `s` is assigned the input string**
