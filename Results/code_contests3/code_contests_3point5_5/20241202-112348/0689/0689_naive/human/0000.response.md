Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes input strings S and T, and then checks if T can be obtained from S by rotating S some number of times. The program generates all possible rotations of T and compares each with S to check if they are equal. If any rotation of T is equal to S, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
