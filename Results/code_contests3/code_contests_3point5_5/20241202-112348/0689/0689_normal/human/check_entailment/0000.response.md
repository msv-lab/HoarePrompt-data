Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two input strings `s` and `t`, and then checks if there exists a rotation of string `t` that is equal to string `s`. It does this by iterating through all possible rotations of string `t` and checking if any of them are equal to string `s`. The code then prints "Yes" if such a rotation exists, and "No" otherwise. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it is handling the cases correctly. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints, it can be considered correct.
