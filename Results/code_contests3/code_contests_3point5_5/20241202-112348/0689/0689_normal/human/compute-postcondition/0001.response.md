Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, assuming it was meant to be `input()`, the user is prompted to input a value which is then assigned to `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T|, `t` is a user input string.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T|, `t` is a user input string**
