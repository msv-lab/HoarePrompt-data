Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by checking if string S equals string T after rotation. It uses list comprehension to generate all possible rotations of string T and checks if any of those rotations match string S. If a match is found, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program covers all possible cases and follows the requirements of the problem description.
