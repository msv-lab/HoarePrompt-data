Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which is used to take user input in Python 2. The user input is stored in `t`. The initial state does not specify the value of `s`, so after execution, the output state is: `s` is a user-input string, `t` is user input.
Output State: **`s` is a user-input string, `t` is user input**
