Example Answer:
The code checks if any rotation of string `t` is equal to string `s`. If any rotation matches `s`, then it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `s` and `t` are provided by the user as input. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a user-input string, `t` is user input, and either 'No' or 'Yes' is printed based on the comparison result.
Output State: **`s` is a user-input string, `t` is user input, and either 'No' or 'Yes' is printed based on the comparison result**
