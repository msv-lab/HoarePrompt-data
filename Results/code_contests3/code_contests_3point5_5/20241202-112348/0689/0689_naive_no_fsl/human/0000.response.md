Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if string S equals string T after rotation. It iterates through all possible rotations of string T and checks if any of them match string S. If a match is found, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input. It correctly checks if S equals T after rotation and prints the expected output.
