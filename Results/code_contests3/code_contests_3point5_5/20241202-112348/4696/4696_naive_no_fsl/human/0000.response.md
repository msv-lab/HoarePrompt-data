Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program calculates the permutation based on the given input values of n and m and outputs the required permutation. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases within the specified constraints.
