Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes input values for n and m, then generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). The program uses the factorial function to calculate the number of permutations and then iterates through all permutations in lexicographical order to find the m-th permutation. The program correctly outputs the required permutation based on the input values n and m. 

Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works correctly for all possible inputs, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is True.
