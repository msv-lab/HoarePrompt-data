Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is an input value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned input values.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned input values**
