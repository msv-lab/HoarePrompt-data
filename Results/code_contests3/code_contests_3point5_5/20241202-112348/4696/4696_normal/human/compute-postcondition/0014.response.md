Example Answer:
Printing the element at index 0 of list `p`, `d` is 0, and the element at index 0 of list `p` is removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is 0, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, the element at index 0 of list `p` is removed, `d` is 0.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is 0, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, the element at index 0 of list `p` is removed, `d` is 0**
