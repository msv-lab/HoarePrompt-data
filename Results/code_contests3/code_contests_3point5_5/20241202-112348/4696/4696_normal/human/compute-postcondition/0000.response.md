Example Answer:
The code snippet `a, b = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user and splits it based on spaces, assigning the first input to variable `a` and the second input to variable `b`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values**
