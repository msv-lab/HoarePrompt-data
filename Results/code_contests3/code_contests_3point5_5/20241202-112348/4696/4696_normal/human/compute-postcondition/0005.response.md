According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is decremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 0. Also, `p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
