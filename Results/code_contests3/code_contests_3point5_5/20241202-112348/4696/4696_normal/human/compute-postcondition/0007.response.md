Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`. At the initial state, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `f` is the factorial of `n - k`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is the factorial of 0 which is 1. Therefore, `d` is 0 divided by 1 which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is 0**
