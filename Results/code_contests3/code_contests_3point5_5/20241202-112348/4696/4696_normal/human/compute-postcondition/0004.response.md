Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n + 1`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact range cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is decremented by 1, and `p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
Output State: **variable `i` is decremented by 1, `p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n + 1`**
