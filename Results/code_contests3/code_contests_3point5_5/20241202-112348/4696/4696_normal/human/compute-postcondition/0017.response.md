According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be 3 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is 0, `f` is the factorial of `n - k` after removing the element at index 0 of list `p`, `d` is 0, `i` is 0**
