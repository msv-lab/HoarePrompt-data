Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value `int(b)`, where `int` converts the input value `b` to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are input values, `i` is an integer**
