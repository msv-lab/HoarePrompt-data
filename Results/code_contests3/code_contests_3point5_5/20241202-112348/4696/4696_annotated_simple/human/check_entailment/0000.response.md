Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) by iterating over the factorial of values from n to 1. It then prints the corresponding value from the permutation list and removes it to generate the required permutation.

The program ensures that the output is the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) as described in the problem statement.
