Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value extracted from the input string `a`. The value of `n` is now determined by the input. The variables `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split().
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split()**
