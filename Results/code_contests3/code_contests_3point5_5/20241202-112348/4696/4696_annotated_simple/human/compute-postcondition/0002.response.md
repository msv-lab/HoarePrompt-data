Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. Since `b` is one of the values returned by raw_input().split(), its actual value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split(), `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split(), `i` is an integer value of `b`**
