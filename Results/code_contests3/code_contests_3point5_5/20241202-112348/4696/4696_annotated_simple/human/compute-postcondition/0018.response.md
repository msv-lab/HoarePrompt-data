Example Answer:
The value of `f` is assigned the factorial of `n - k`. The value of `k` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `n`. The value at index `d` in list `p` is removed. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `p` are unknown, so the output state is: factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed.
Output State: **factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed.**
