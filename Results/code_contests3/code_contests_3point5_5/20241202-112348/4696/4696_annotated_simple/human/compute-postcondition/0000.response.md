Example Answer:
`a, b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. The variables `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split().
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split()**
