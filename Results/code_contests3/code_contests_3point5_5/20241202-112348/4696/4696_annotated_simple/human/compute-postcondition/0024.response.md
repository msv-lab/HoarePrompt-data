The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the number of permutations of length `n` such that the maximum possible value of `f(p)` is `m`, where `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 1 <= m <= cntn, and cntn is the number of permutations of length `n`. The function returns the count of such permutations. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of permutations of length n with a maximum value of f(p) as m, where 1 <= m <= cntn, and cntn is the number of permutations of length n.**
