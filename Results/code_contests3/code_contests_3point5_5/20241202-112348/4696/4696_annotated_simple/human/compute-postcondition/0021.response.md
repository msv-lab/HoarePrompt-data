Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `p` is removed. The previous state of the variables is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed.
Output State: **factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed**
