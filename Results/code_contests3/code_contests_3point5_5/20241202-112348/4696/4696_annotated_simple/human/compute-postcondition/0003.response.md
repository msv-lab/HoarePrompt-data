Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it is an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split(), `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by raw_input().split(), `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1**
