Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated as the floor division of `i` by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are not provided, so the exact value of `d` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed.
Output State: **factorial of `n - k` is calculated, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `d` in list `p` is removed**
