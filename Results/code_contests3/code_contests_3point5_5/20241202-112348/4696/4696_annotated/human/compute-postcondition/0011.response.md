According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the element at index `d` removed. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 1`. 
State: **`i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the element at index `d` removed, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be `k + 1` and less than or equal to `n`**
