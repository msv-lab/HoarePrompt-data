Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`, and the value at index `d` of list `p` is printed, and the element at index `d` is removed from list `p`.**
