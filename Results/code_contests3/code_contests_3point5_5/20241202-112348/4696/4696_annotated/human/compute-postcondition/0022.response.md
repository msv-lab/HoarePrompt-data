Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are unknown, so the exact result cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`**
