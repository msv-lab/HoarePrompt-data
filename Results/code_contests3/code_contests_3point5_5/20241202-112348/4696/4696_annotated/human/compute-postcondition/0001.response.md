Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is an input value. The value of `n` is now determined by the input value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values**
