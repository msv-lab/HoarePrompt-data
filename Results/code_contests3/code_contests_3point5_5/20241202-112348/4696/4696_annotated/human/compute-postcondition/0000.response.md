Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string based on spaces. Since the initial state does not provide information about the input values, the output state is simply: n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned input values**
