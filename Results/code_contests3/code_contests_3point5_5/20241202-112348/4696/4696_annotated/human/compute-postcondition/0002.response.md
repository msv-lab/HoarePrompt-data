Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, where `b` is an input. The values of `a`, `n`, and `m` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
