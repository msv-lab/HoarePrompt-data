Example Answer:
Initially, `i`, `f`, `p`, `k`, `n`, and `d` are updated based on their respective descriptions. Then the program prints the element of `p` at index `d`. The output state is: `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the element at index `d` removed, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has the element at index `d` removed, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`**
