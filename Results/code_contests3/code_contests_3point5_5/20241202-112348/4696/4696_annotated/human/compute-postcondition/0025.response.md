Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input. It then calculates the number of permutations of length `n` and determines the maximum possible value of `f(p)`, denoted as `cntn`. The function iterates through a loop to calculate and print values based on certain calculations. However, the function does not accept any parameters as mentioned in the annotations, which contradicts the initial statement. The functionality is focused on permutation calculation and value determination based on constraints, but the absence of parameter passing needs to be addressed.**
