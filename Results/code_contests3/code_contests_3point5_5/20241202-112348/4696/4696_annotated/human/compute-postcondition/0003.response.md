Example Answer:
`i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is `b`, so after execution, `i` is `b - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is `b - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer determined by the input value of `a`, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is `b - 1`**
