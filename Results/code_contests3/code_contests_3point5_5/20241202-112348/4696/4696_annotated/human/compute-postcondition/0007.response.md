Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by integer division of `i` by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned input values, `i` is `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`**
