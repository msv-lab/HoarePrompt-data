Example Answer: 
The element at index `d` is removed from list `p`. The values of `i`, `p`, `k`, `f`, and `d` are not specifically given, so we cannot calculate the specific values after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`**
