Example Answer:
`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, but the previous values of `n`, `k`, and `factorial` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`, `k` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `n`, `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`**
