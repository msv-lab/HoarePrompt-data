Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, calculates the maximum salary for each company, finds the overall maximum salary, and then calculates the total increase needed to make all companies have the same maximum salary.

The program should work correctly for all potential cases as it handles the salary increase based on the maximum salary of each company.
