The function `func` reads input data about multiple companies in a conglomerate. Each company's information includes the number of employees and their salaries. It calculates the difference between the maximum salary in all companies and each company's maximum salary, then multiplies this difference by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it prints the total sum of these calculated values. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The provided annotations describe the state of variables at different points in the code execution, ensuring accurate processing of the conglomerate's data.
