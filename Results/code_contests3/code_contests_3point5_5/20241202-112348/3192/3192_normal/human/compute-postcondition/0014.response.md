Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: temp is assigned the maximum value between its current value and all the values in arr1 excluding the first element, n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, arr is a list containing integers entered by the user with temp appended to it, maxval is 0, arr2 is an empty list.
Output State: **temp is assigned the maximum value between its current value and all the values in arr1 excluding the first element, n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, arr is a list containing integers entered by the user with temp appended to it, maxval is 0, arr2 is an empty list**
