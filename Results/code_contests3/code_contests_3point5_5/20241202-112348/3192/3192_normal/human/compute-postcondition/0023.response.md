Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than the value at index 0 in `arr1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated based on the comparison with the value at index 1 in `arr1` and `j` needs to be less than the value at index 0 in `arr1` for the loop to continue.
Output State: **`temp` is updated based on the comparison with the value at index 1 in `arr1` and `j` needs to be less than the value at index 0 in `arr1` for the loop to continue**
