According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the value at index 0 in arr1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, temp is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` in arr1. So for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **temp is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in arr1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the value at index 0 in arr1**
