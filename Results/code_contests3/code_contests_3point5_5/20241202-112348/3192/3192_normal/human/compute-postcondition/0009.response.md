According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `n` is still a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is still an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, arr is a list containing integers entered by the user, maxval is 0, arr2 is an empty list, for the loop to execute the second time n is greater than 0 and i is 0, temp is assigned the maximum value between temp and arr1[j], arr1[0] is greater than 1**
