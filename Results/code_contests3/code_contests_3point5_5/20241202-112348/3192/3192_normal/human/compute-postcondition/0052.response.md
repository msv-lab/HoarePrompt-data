Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of all products computed in the loop. The variables `temp`, `n`, `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in the last input list `arr1`, `n` is equal to the number of iterations specified, `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each input list, `ans` is the sum of all products computed in the loop.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in the last input list `arr1`, `n` is equal to the number of iterations specified, `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each input list, `ans` is the sum of all products computed in the loop**
