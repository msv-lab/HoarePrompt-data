According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has the value at index 0 of `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` remains updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `i` is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` still holds the list of integers obtained from the input split, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 3 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.
State: **Output State: `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has the value at index 0 of `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` remains updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `i` is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` still holds the list of integers obtained from the input split, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3**
