Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` and `arr1[j]` is unknown, but it is guaranteed that `arr1` has at least one element and the value of that element is greater than 1. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` in `arr1`.
Output State: **temp is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` in arr1**
