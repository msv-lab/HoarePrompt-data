Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is increased by the product of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` in the range of the length of `arr`. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `ans` are known. Therefore, we can calculate the result by substituting these values into the expression. 
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in the last input list `arr1`, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each input list, `ans` is the updated value after executing the code**
