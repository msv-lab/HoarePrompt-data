Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` in `arr1`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than the updated value at index 0 in `arr1`. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`temp` is updated based on comparison with value at index 1 in `arr1`, `j` is updated, loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than updated value at index 0 in `arr1**.
