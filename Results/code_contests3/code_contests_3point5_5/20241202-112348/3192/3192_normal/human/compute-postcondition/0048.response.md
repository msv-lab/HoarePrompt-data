Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` for each element in the list. Since `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list and `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, the value of `ans` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in the last input list `arr1`, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each input list, `ans` is the updated value after executing the code.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in the last input list `arr1`, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value from each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all the input lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each input list, `ans` is the updated value after executing the code**
