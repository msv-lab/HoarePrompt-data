Output State: **`temp` is 0, `j` is the value at index 0 in `arr1`, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has the value at index 0 of `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `i` is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`, `arr1` is assigned the list of integers obtained from the input split.**
