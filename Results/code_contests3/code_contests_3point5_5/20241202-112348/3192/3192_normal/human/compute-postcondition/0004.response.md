According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, arr is an empty list, maxval is 0, and arr2 is an empty list do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to n is greater than 0 and i is 0. 
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
