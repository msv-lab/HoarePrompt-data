According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and the values in `arr1`. If `j` is less than the value at index 0 in `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with the value at index 1 in `arr1`, and `j` needs to be less than the value at index 0 in `arr1` for the loop to continue. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the value at index 0 in `arr1` after the update.
State: **`temp` is updated based on the comparison with the value at index 1 in `arr1`, `j` is updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than the updated value at index 0 in `arr1`**
