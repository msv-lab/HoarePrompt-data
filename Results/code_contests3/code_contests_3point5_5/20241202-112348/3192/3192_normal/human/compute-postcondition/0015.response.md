The code snippet `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the first element of `arr1` to `arr2`. The initial state shows that `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and all the values in `arr1` excluding the first element, and `arr` contains integers entered by the user with `temp` appended to it. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **temp is assigned the maximum value between its current value and all the values in arr1 excluding the first element, n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, arr is a list containing integers entered by the user with temp appended to it, maxval is 0, arr2 contains the first element of arr1**
