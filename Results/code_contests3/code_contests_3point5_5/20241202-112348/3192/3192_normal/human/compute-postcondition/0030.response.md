According to the code, whether the loop can execute further depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in the list `arr1` from index 1 to the value at index 0, `j` is updated to the value at index 0 in `arr1`, indicating that the loop will not execute further. `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has the value at index 0 of `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `n` must be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value in the list `arr1` from index 1 to the value at index 0, `j` is the value at index 0 in `arr1`, `arr` has `temp` appended to it, `arr2` has the value at index 0 of `arr1` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `i` is updated to i+1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the updated `i`**
