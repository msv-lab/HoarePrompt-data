According to the code, the loop can execute if arr1 has at least 1 element, and the value of that element is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, temp is assigned 0, n is a positive integer, arr is a list containing integers with 0 appended, maxval is the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval, arr2 contains the first element of arr1, i is 0. So, for the loop to execute the first time, arr1 must have at least 1 element, and j is 1.
State: **temp is 0, n is a positive integer, arr is a list containing integers with 0 appended, maxval is the maximum value between arr[i] and maxval, arr2 contains the first element of arr1, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of that element is greater than 1, j is 1**
