Example Answer:
`arr2` is assigned an empty list. There are no changes to the values of `n`, `arr`, or `maxval`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of companies; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
