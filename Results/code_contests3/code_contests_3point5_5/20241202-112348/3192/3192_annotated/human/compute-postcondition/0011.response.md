According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, the first element of `arr1` is greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 and `temp` needs to be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 2 of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the value at index 2 of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 2 of `arr1**.
