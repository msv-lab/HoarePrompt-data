Example Answer:
The list `arr1` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The previous values of `arr1`, `temp`, `arr`, `maxval`, `i`, and `n` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`**
