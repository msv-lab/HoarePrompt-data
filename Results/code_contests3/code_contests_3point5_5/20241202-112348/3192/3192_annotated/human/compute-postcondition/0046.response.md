Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `maxval` is the maximum value between all the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value of each `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the elements of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]-1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
