Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of companies.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies**
