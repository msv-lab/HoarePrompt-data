According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `arr1`. If `n+1` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n+1` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `maxval` is the maximum value between all the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value of each `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the elements of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n+2`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]-1`, `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i-1]) * arr2[i-1]`, for the loop to execute the second time `n+2` is greater than 0, `ans` is further updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]**
