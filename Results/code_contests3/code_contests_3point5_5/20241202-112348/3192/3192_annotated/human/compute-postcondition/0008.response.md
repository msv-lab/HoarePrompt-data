Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value at index `j` from the list `arr1`. Since `temp` is initially 0 and `j` is 1, the value at index 1 from the list `arr1` is compared to 0 and the maximum value is assigned to `temp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is the maximum value in arr1, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with arr1[0] greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the value at index 1 of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is the maximum value in arr1, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with arr1[0] greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the value at index 1 of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
