Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value of `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 2, so `arr1[2]` is accessed. For this loop to execute, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. The specific values of `temp`, `arr1[2]`, and the comparison with `arr1[0]` are not provided, so the output state is: `temp` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the value of `arr1[2]`, with a condition on `arr1[0]` being greater than 2.
Output State: **`temp` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the value of `arr1[2]`, with a condition on `arr1[0]` being greater than 2**
