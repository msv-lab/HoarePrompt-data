According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `temp` remains the maximum value in `arr1`.
- `arr` still contains the maximum value of `arr1`.
- `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value.
- `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than the updated `i` value for the loop to execute again.

State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`**
