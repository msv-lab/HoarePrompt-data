Example Answer: 
`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`. Since `temp` is compared with the element at index `j`, it will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the value at index `j` in `arr1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1, `j` is 2**
