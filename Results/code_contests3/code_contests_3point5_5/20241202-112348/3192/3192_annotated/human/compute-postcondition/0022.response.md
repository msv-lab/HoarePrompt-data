According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `arr1` must have at least 2 elements with the first element greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1, `j` is 2**
