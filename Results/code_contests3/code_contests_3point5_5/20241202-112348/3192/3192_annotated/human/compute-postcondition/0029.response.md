Example Answer:
The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the existing maximum value `maxval`. Since the initial state mentions that `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, and `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, we can assume that `temp` and `arr` are initialized with the maximum value of `arr1`. After running the code snippet, `maxval` will contain the new maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the existing maximum value `maxval`. Hence, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value**
