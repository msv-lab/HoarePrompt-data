According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr1` and `j`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1, `j` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the first element of `arr1` must be greater than 2 and `j` should be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 2, `j` is 3**
