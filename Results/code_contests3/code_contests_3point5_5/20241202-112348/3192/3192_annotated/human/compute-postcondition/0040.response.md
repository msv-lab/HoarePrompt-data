Example Answer: 
`temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The previous values of `temp`, `j`, and `arr1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value between the elements of `arr1` from index 1 up to `arr1[0]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr1[0]` is the total number of elements in `arr1`, and `temp` is appended to `arr`.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between the elements of `arr1` from index 1 up to `arr1[0]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr1[0]` is the total number of elements in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr`**
