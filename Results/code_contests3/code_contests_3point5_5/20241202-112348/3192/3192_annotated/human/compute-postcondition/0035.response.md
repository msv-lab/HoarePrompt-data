According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value of `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than the new value of `j`.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value of `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
