According to the code, the loop will execute if `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute `arr1` must have at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1. Additionally, the loop will iterate from 1 to the first element of `arr1`, so `j` will start from 1. Also, since `temp` is mentioned in the initial state, it should be kept as is.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1, `j` is 1**
