Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The condition `arr1[0]` being greater than 2 must still hold for the loop to execute one more time. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the updated value of `arr1[2]`, with a condition on `arr1[0]` being greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2.
Output State: **`temp` is updated based on the comparison between its current value and the updated value of `arr1[2]`, with a condition on `arr1[0]` being greater than 2, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2**
