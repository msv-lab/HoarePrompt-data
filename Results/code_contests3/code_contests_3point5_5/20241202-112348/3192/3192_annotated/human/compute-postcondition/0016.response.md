Example Answer: 
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`. As `i` is initially 0, this means `maxval` will be updated to the maximum value between the first element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`. Therefore, `maxval` is updated to a new maximum value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`**
