According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of arr1[0]. If arr1[0] is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that arr1[0] is greater than 1, j is 1, and maxval is set to the maximum value in arr1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is the maximum value in arr1, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with arr1[0] greater than 1, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
