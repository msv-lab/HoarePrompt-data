Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the first element of `arr1`. The maximum value in `arr1` is stored in `temp`, and the maximum value of `arr1` is stored in `arr`. Since we are only appending the first element of `arr1` to `arr2`, the values of `temp` and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`**
