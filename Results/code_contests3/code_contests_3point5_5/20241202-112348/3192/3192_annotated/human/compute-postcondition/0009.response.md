According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the values in the list `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first value in `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1` contains values obtained from input values with arr1[0] greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it must be less than the first value in `arr1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is the maximum value in arr1, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with arr1[0] greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the value at index 1 of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 2**
