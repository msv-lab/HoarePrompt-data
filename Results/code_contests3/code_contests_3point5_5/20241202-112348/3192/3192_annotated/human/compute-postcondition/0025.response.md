Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, where `j` is 3. The value of `temp` is updated based on the contents of `arr1`, which is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1. The loop executes successfully since `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `j` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `j` is 3**
