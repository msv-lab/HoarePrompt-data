According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the initial state should be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time**
