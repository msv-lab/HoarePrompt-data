Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, so the maximum value of `arr1` is added to the list `arr`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value of `arr1`**
