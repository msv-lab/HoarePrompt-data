Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the information about multiple companies, calculates the maximum salary in each company, and then determines the minimum total increase needed to merge all companies into one. The algorithm used in the program ensures that the maximum salaries of the companies are equal after the necessary increases are made, meeting the anti-monopoly requirements. The program handles the input constraints specified in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the described problem.
