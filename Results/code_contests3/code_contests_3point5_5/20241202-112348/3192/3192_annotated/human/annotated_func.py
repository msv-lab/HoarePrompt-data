#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies. Each company description includes an integer m_i representing the number of employees in the company, followed by m_i positive integers representing the salaries of the employees. The salaries do not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = []
    maxval = 0
    arr2 = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
        temp = 0
        
        for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
            temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
        
        arr.append(temp)
        
        arr2.append(arr1[0])
        
        maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `maxval` is the maximum value between all the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value of each `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the elements of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]-1`
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `maxval` is the maximum value between all the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the maximum value of each `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input values with the first element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the elements of each `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]-1`, `ans` contains the sum of products `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all elements in `arr`
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads information about multiple companies, calculates the average salary of all employees, and prints the result. It processes the data provided for each company to determine the average salary based on the maximum salary within each company. There is a potential issue in the code where the loop should start from index 1 instead of 1 in the inner loop to avoid out of range errors.
