Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimal total increase of all salaries that allows merging all companies into one. It iterates through each company, finds the maximum salary within that company, and keeps track of the maximum salary overall. Then, it calculates the total increase needed by taking the difference between the overall maximum salary and the maximum salary of each company, multiplied by the number of employees in that company, and summing all these values.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly computes the minimal total increase required.
