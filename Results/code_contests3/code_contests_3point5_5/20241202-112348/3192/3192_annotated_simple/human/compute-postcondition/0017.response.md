According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than `n+1`**
