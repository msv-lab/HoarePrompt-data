According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `arr1[0]` should still be at least 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2**
