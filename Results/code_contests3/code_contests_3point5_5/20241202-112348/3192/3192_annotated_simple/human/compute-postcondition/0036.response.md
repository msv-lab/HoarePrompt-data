Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` would be the third element of `arr1`. The value of `arr1` is entered through input, so it could be any positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `temp` depends on the comparison between its current value and the third element of `arr1`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the third element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2.**
