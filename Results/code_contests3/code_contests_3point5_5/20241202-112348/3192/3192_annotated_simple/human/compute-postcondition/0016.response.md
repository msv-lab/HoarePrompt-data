Example Answer:
The code snippet iterates through the list `arr` and updates the value of `maxval` to be the maximum value between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. Initially, `maxval` is 0. After execution, `maxval` will hold the maximum value among all elements in the list `arr`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0].
