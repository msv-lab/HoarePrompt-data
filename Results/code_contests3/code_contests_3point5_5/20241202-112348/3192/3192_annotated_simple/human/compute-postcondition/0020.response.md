According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. However, the loop will not execute if `arr1[0]` is less than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `maxval` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `i` should be less than `n+1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than `n+1, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `temp` is 0**
