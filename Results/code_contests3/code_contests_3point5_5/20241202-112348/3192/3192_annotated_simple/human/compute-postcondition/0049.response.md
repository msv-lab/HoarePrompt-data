According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` holds the maximum value from each company, `maxval` is the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, `ans` is updated according to the calculation, `i` has been incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` holds the maximum value from each company, `maxval` is the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, `ans` is updated according to the calculation, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
