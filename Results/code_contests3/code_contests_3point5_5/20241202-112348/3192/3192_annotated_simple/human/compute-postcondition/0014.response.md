Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The list `arr` contains values entered through input. So the new state of `arr` will have all the previous values along with `temp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0].
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0]**
