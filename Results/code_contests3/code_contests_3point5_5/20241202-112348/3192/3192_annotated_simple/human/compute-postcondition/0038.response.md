Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the third element of `arr1` at index `j`. `temp` is updated accordingly based on the comparison. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the third element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and the third element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
