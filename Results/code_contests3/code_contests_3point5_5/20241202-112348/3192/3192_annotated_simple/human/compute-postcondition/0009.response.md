According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `arr1[0]` should still be greater than the updated `j`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `temp` is updated with the maximum value, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
