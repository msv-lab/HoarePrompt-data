According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and the elements in `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` should be less than `arr1[0]`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted such that it is less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input along with `temp`, `maxval` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `temp` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than `n+1, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `arr1[0] - 1**
