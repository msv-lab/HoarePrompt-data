Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` holds the maximum value from each company, `maxval` is the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, `ans` is updated according to the calculation, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1.
