According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, to ensure the loop executes, `arr` must be a list containing the maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` must hold the maximum value from each company, `maxval` must represent the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, and `ans` must be 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` holds the maximum value from each company, `maxval` is the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, `ans` is 0**
