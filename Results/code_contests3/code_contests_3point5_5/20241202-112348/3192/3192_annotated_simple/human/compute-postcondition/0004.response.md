According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the total number of companies is represented by `n`, which implies the loop can execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
