Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is updated based on this comparison. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, each company description consists of `m_i` employees with their salaries, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input, `maxval` is 0, `temp` is updated with the maximum value, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.
