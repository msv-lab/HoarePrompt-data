Example Answer:
The maximum value from the list `arr1` is stored in `temp`. The list `arr` is then appended with the value of `temp`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input with the maximum value appended to it, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input with the maximum value appended to it, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces**
