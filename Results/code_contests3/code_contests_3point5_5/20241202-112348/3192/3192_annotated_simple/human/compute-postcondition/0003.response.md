Example Answer:
`arr2` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of companies. Each company description consists of an integer m_i representing the number of employees in the company, followed by m_i integers representing the salaries of the employees in that company. All salaries are positive integers and do not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `arr` is an empty list. `maxval` is 0
