The `maxval` variable is updated to be the maximum value between the current element in `arr` at index `i` and the previous `maxval`. Since `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, the new `maxval` will be the maximum value among all elements of `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is updated with the maximum value among all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` and `arr` now contains values with the maximum value appended.
