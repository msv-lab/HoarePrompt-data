Example Answer:
The code compares the value at index `i` of list `arr` with the current value of `maxval` and assigns the larger value back to `maxval`. Since `maxval` is initially updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, it will be updated with the maximum value between the current value at index `i` of `arr` and the current `maxval`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input with the maximum value appended to it, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0`**.
