Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr`, `maxval` is updated with the maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than `n+1, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `arr1[0] - 1**
