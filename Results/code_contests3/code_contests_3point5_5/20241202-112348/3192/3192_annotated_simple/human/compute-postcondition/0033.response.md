According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Before the loop starts, `j` is initialized to 1 and `arr1` contains integers entered through input. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains values with the maximum value appended, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from `arr`, `j` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers entered through input, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2**
