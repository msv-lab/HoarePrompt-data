Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value stored in the variable `ans`. The `ans` variable is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each company in the list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing maximum salaries of employees in each company, `temp` holds the maximum value from each company, `maxval` is the overall maximum salary among all employees in all companies, `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each company in the list and the final result is printed.
