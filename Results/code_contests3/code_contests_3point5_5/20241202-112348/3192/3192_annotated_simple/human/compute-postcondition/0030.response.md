According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input with the maximum value appended to it, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will be increased by 1 and `n` will remain the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is a list containing the values entered through input with the maximum value appended to it, `temp` holds the maximum value from the list `arr1`, `maxval` is updated with the new maximum value from the list `arr`, `j` is such that `j+1` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr2` contains `arr1[0], `arr1` is assigned a list of integers entered through input split by spaces, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`**
