Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The main issue is that the program takes the input as a string, not as an integer. This will cause errors in the calculations later on. Additionally, the program does not implement the process of subtracting a digit from the number until it reaches zero as described in the problem.

To correct the program, the input should be converted to an integer using `int(input())`. Then, a loop should be implemented to continuously subtract a digit from the number until it reaches zero, keeping track of the number of operations performed. Finally, the program should print the minimum number of operations required to reduce the number to zero.
