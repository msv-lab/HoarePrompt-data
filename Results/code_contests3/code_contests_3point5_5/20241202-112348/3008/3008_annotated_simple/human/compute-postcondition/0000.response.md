Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a non-negative integer, after running the code, `n` will hold the input value as a string. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer as a string.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer as a string**
