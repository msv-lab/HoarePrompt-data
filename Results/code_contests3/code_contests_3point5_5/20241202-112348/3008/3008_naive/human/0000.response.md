Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The program only considers the last digit of the input number `n` and does not perform the required subtraction operation on a digit that actually occurs in the number. Additionally, the program uses integer division (`//`) which would result in a wrong answer for values greater than 9. 

For example, if we input `24`, the program will output `2` instead of `5` as the minimum number of operations.
