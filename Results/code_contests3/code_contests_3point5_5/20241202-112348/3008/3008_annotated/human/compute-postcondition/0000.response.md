Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `n` will be a non-negative integer entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer entered by the user.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer entered by the user**
