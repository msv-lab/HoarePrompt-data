Example Answer:
The value of `s` is updated based on the last digit of `n`. If the last digit of `n` is not 0, then `s` is updated to 1, otherwise it remains 0. Then, the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is evaluated and printed. `n` is a non-negative integer entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer entered by the user, `s` is either 0 or 1, and the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer entered by the user, `s` is either 0 or 1, and the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is printed**
