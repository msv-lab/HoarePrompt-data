The function `func` prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n`, calculates `s` based on whether the last digit of `n` is not zero, and then prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. The function does not explicitly return any value, and it assumes that the user will input a valid non-negative integer. However, there is a missing functionality where the input should be converted to an integer type for proper arithmetic operations.
