The function `func` reads an input `n`, checks if `n` is not divisible by 10, updates the value of `s` accordingly, and then prints the result of the expression 2 * (n / 10) + s. However, there is a missing logic where the input `n` needs to be converted to an integer type before performing mathematical operations. This missing conversion might lead to unexpected results or errors.
