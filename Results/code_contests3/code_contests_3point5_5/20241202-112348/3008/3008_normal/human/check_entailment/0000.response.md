Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is not correctly calculating the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. 

For example, if we input `24`, the code will output `4` instead of the correct answer `5` as shown in the problem description. The code does not handle the case where the subtraction digit needs to be chosen strategically to minimize the number of operations. It simply divides the number by `10` and multiplies by `2`, which does not always result in the correct answer.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
