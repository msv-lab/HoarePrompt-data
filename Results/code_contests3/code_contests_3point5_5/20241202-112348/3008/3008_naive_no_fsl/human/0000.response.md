Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the magic number is not divisible by 10. In such cases, the program should subtract a digit (which is present in the number) from the magic number until it becomes zero. The program in its current form only considers the case when the magic number is divisible by 10 and calculates the result incorrectly. 

Example:
Input:
24

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output:
2
