Example Answer:
The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list `c`. The list `c` contains 101 integers representing the frequency of each index in list `a`, so the maximum value in `c` is the highest frequency of any index in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers representing the frequency of each index in `a` in the original list, and the maximum frequency value from `c` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers representing the frequency of each index in `a` in the original list, and the maximum frequency value from `c` is printed**
