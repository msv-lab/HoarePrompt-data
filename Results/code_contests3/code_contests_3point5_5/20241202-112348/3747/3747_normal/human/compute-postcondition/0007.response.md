Example Answer:
The value of `c` at index `d` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `d` is the first element in the list `a`, and `c` is a list of 101 zeros. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` will be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 zeros with the value at index `d` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `d` is the first element in the list `a`**
