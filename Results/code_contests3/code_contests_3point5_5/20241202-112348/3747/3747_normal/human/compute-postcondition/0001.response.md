Example Answer:
The code assigns the list of integers input by splitting the raw input to variable `a`. Since `n` is not affected by this code snippet, the value of `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of integers input by splitting the raw input.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a is a list of integers input by splitting the raw input**
