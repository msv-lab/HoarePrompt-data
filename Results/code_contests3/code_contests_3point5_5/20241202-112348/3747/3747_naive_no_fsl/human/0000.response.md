Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only counts the frequency of each coin value and prints the maximum frequency, which does not correspond to the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. 

For example, for the input:
6
1 2 4 3 3 2

The correct output should be 2, but the program will output 2. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
