Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. It simply counts the occurrences of each coin value in the list and prints the maximum count, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. 

The program only prints 5 if the input `n` is equal to 11, which is not a correct way to solve the problem for all possible inputs. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
