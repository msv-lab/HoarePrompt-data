Example Answer:
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` can be any integer from 0 to 100 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers where the value at index `d` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers where the value at index `d` is incremented by 1**
