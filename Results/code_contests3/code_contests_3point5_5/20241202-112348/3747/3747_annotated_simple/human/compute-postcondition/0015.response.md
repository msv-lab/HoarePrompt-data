Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user input. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of 101 elements initialized to 0. It iterates over the elements in list `a` and increments the corresponding index in list `c` by the number of occurrences of that element. Finally, it prints the maximum value in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
