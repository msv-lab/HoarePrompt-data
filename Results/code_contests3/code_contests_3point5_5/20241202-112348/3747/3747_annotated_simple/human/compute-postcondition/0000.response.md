Example Answer:
n is assigned the value of int(raw_input()), where raw_input() accepts user input as a string and int() converts it to an integer. The variable n can now hold an integer value between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100**
