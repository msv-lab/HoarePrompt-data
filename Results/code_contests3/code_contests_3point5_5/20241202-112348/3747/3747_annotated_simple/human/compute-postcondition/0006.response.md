According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The loop will iterate over each element in `a`. At the start of the loop, the index `d` will be assigned the value of the current element in `a`. The loop will execute for each element in `a` sequentially.

Therefore, to adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0**
