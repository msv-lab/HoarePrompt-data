Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in the list `c` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state mentions that the value at index `d` in the list `c` is already incremented by 1, the value at index `d` will be further incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 2 elements, and the value at index `d` in the list `c` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 2 elements, and the value at index `d` in the list `c` is incremented by 2**
