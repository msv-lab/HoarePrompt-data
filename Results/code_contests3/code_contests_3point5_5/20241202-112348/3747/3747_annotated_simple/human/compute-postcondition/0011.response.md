Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `c` and `d` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 2 elements, and the value at index `d+1` in the list `c` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 2 elements, and the value at index `d+1` in the list `c` is incremented by 2**
