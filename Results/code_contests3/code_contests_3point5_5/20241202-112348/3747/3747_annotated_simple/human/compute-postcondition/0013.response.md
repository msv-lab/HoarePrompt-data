Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers where the value at index `d` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `d` in list `a`. The maximum value in list `c` is printed using the `print` function.**
