Example Answer:
A list `c` is created with 101 elements all initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each input value to an integer and splitting the input based on spaces, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0**
