Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks for a specific case (if n == 11) and prints a hardcoded value (5) without actually solving the problem as described in the problem statement. This means that for any other input, the program does not provide the correct output. 

For example, if we take the input:
```
6
1 2 4 3 3 2
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the given program will not output the correct result for this input.
