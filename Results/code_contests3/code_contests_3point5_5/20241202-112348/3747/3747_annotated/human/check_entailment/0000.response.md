Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It does not distribute the coins between pockets as required by the problem description. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each coin value and prints the maximum count.

The program does not determine the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins with no two coins of the same value in the same pocket. Additionally, the if block with (n == 11) condition seems to be a hardcoded check for a specific case and does not contribute to solving the general problem.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
