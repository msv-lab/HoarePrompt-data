You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    if (n == 11) :
        print(5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is an input integer between 1 and 100, a_i are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If n is equal to 11, the number 5 is printed.
    c = [0] * 101
    for d in a:
        c[d] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `c` is a list of 101 elements with each element representing the count of occurrences of the corresponding index in `a`, `a` is a non-empty list, `d` is the last element of `a` after the loop execution
    print(max(c))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of integers `a`. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the number 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of 101 elements, initializes them to 0, and counts the occurrences of each element in list `a`. Finally, it prints the maximum count of occurrences in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates independently without any input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
