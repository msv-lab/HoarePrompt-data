Example Answer:
The element at index `d` of list `c` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a_i`, `a`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the element at index `d` incremented by 1, `a` is a non-empty list with more than 1 element, `d` is the second element of `a` for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the element at index `d` incremented by 1, `a` is a non-empty list with more than 1 element, `d` is the second element of `a` for the loop to execute a second time**.
