Example Answer:
The element at index `d` of list `c` is incremented by 1. Since `d` is the third element of list `a`, `d` is updated to `a[2]`. The number of elements in list `a` is more than 2, so the loop executes a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the element at index `d` incremented by 2, `a` is a non-empty list with more than 2 elements, `d` is the updated third element of `a` after the loop execution.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the element at index `d` incremented by 2, `a` is a non-empty list with more than 2 elements, `d` is the updated third element of `a` after the loop execution**
