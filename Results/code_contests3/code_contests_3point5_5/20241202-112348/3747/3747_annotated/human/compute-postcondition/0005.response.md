Example Answer:
A list `c` is initialized with 101 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If n is equal to 11, the number 5 is printed; `c` is a list of 101 elements all set to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If n is equal to 11, the number 5 is printed; `c` is a list of 101 elements all set to 0**
