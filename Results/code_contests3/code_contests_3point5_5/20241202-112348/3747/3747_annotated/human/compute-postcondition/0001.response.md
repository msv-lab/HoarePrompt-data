Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted as integers after splitting the input. The input contains `n` integers. The values of `a_i` are integers ranging from 1 to 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
