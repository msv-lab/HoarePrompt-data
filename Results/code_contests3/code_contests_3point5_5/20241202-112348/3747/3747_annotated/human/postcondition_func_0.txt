The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of integers `a`. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the number 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of 101 elements, initializes them to 0, and counts the occurrences of each element in list `a`. Finally, it prints the maximum count of occurrences in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates independently without any input.
