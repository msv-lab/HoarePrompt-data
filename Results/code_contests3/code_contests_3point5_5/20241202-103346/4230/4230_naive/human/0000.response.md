Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 0 1 0 0
```
The program should output 3, as Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first 3 doors. However, the program outputs 2 which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases and is incorrect.
