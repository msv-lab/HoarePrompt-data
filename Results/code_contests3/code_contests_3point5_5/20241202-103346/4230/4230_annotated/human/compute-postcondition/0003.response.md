The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Since there are no operations or assignments following the initialization, the value of `ans` remains 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `ans` is 0**
