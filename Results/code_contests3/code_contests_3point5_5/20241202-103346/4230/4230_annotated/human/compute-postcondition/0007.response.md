Output State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is set to `n - 2`, the element at index `i` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
