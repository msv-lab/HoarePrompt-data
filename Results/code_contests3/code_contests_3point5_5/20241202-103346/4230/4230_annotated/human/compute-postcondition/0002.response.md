Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to integers. Since `n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` will contain the list of integers after splitting the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers**
