Example Answer:
If there exists at least one element in list `c` that is different from its adjacent element, then `ans` will be equal to the index of the first occurrence of this element in reverse order. Otherwise, `ans` will remain 0. The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans` to the console.
Output State: **If there exists at least one different element in list `c`, `ans` will be equal to the index of the first occurrence of this element in reverse order. Otherwise, `ans` will remain 0.**
