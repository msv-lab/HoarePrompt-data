According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and `i` is set to `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is set to `n - 2`**
