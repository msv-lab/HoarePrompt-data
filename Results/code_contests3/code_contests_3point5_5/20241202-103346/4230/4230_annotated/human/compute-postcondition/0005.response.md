Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is set to `n - 2`. In addition, the element at index `i` in list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`***
