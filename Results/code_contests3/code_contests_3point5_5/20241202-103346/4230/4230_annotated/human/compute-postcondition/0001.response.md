Example Answer:
`n` is reassigned to the first element of the iterator resulting from mapping input split by spaces to integers. Since `n` was originally an iterator resulting from mapping input split by spaces to integers, after this reassignment, `n` will now hold the first integer value from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer value from the input.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer value from the input**
