Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer value from the input, `c` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` needs to be adjusted based on the loop statement, the element at index `i` in list `c` should not be equal to the element at index `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. After the execution of the if else block, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`***
