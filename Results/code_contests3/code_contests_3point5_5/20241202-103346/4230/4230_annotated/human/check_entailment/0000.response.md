Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input as specified in the problem description. It then iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and finds the index of the first door that is located in a different exit from the next door. This index represents the point at which Mr. Black can exit the house, as all doors in at least one exit will be open at that point.

Therefore, the program correctly finds the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
