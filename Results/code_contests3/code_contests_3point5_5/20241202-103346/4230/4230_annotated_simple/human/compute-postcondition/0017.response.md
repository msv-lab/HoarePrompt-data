Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input. If there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `c` that are different, then `ans` is the index of the first differing pair of elements. If all consecutive elements in `c` are the same, then `ans` remains 0.**
