Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, c is a list of integers obtained from input, ans is i + 1, for the loop to execute the first time i is n - 2. The element at index i in list c is not equal to the element at index i + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
