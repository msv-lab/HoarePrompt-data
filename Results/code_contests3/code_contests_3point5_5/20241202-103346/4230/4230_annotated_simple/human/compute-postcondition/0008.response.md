Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` is n - 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
