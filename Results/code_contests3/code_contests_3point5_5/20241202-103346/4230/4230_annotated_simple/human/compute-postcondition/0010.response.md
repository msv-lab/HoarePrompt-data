Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is `n - 3`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is updated based on the condition, `i` is n - 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is updated based on the condition, `i` is n - 3**
