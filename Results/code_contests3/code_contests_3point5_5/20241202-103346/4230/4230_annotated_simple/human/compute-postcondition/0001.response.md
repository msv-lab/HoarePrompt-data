Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `n[0]`, which means `n` will take the value of the first element in the list `n`. Since `n` is an integer and not a list, this operation will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
