Example Answer:
If there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `c` that are different, then `ans` is the index of the first differing pair of elements. If all consecutive elements in `c` are the same, then `ans` remains 0. The program prints the value of `ans`.
Output State: **The program prints the value of `ans`.**
