Example Answer:
The code reads a sequence of integers from input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning the result to variable `c`. The initial state is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, c is a list of integers obtained from input**
