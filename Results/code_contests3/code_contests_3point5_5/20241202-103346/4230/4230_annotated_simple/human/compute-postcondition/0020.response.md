Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It reads input to determine the number of doors and their initial state. Then, it iterates through the sequence of door states and finds the first index where consecutive door states differ. The function prints the index of the first differing pair of elements. If all consecutive elements in the sequence are the same, it prints 0. **
