Example Answer:
n is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to an integer. Since the initial state of n is an integer, it remains unaffected. The sequence of opened doors is not explicitly assigned a value, so it remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
