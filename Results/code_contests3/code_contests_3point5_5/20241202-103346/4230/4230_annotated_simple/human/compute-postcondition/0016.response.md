Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
