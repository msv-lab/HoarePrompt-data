According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `n` is given to be between 2 and 200,000 which means the loop will execute. The loop is iterating over the range from `n - 2` to 0 in reverse order. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is n - 2**
