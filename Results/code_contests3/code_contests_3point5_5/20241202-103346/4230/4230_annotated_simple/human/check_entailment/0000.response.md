Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of doors `n` and the sequence of opened doors `c`. It then iterates through the sequence of opened doors starting from the second last door to the first door. If it finds a pair of consecutive doors that are located in different exits, it updates the `ans` variable to be the index of the first differing pair of doors. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors.

The program correctly identifies the index at which Mr. Black can exit the house based on the sequence of opened doors. It follows the problem description and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
