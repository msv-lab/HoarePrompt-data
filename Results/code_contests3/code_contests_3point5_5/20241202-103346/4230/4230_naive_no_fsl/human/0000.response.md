Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order starting from the second to last door. It checks if the current door is in a different exit than the next door. If it is, it updates the answer with the current index. This logic correctly determines the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, so it is correct.
