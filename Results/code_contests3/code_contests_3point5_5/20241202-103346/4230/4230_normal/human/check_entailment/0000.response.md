Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code only considers the last index where the current door state is different from the next door state. However, it does not account for the condition where all doors in at least one exit need to be open for Mr. Black to exit the house. 

For example, in the input:
```
5
0 0 1 0 0
```
The code will output `3`, indicating that after opening the third door, Mr. Black can exit the house. However, this is incorrect because after opening the third door, all doors from the right exit are open but there are still two closed doors in the left exit. Therefore, Mr. Black cannot exit the house at that moment.

Thus, the code does not handle the case where all doors in at least one exit need to be open for Mr. Black to exit the house, making the correctness **False**.
