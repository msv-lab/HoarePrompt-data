According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is at least 2. Before the loop starts, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, which ensures the loop will execute. The loop iterates from n-2 down to 0 by decrementing by 1 each time. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` is at least 2, `c` contains the mapped input values, and `ans` remains 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `i` is n-2**
