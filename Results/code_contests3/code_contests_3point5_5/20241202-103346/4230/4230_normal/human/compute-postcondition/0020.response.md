Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a sequence of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black. It then iterates through the sequence to find the last index where the current door state is different from the next door state. If such an index is found, it sets `ans` to that index + 1; otherwise, it sets `ans` to 0. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function handles the constraint 2 <= n <= 200,000.**
