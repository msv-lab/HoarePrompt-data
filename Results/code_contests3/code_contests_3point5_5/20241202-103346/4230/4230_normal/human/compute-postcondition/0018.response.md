Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `ans` which is calculated based on the condition mentioned. The value of `ans` is already assigned based on the condition where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. If such an index exists, then `ans` is assigned the value of that index incremented by 1. If no such index is found, then `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, and `ans` holds the required value based on the condition.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` holds the required value based on the condition**
