Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` is equal to `i + 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` is equal to `i + 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than or equal to 1**
