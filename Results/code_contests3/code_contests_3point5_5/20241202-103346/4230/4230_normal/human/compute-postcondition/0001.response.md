Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the first element of the sequence `n`. Since `n` is an integer, it will take the value of the first element of the sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000 and n is updated based on the first element of the sequence.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000 and n is updated based on the first element of the sequence**
