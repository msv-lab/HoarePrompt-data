According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` is equal to `i + 1, and `i` is 0. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `n - 2` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 to be -1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values, `ans` is equal to 0, for the loop to execute again `i` must be greater than or equal to -1**
