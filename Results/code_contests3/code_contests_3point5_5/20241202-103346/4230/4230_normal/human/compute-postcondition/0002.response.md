Example Answer:
The code assigns the result of mapping the `int` function to the input values split by spaces to the variable `c`. The variable `n` is updated based on the first element of the sequence, which is not explicitly mentioned here. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, `c` contains the mapped input values**
