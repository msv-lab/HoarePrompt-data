Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element representing a row of the grid; `A` is the first element of the list `l`; `B` is the second element of the list `l`; `ans` is 2; `C` is a list containing the string representation of the integer `i`, where the first element of `C` is equal to the fifth element of `C`, and the second element of `C` is equal to the third element of `C`; for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be increased by 1. If the first element of `C` is equal to the fifth element of `C` and the second element of `C` is equal to the third element of `C`, then the program returns the specified values.***
