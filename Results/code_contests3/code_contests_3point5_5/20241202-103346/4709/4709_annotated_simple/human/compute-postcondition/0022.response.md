Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `ans` which represents the count of numbers where the first and fifth digits are equal and the second and third digits are equal, within the range of `A` to `B` (exclusive). The values of `l`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element representing a row of the grid; `A` is the first element of the list `l`; `B` is the second element of the list `l`; `ans` is printed**
