Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, where `a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. The `split()` function splits the string into a list of strings based on whitespace. Therefore, after execution, `l` will be a list containing 3 elements, each element representing a row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element representing a row of the grid**.
