Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 3. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the single letter from `a`; `A` is the ASCII value of the letter in `l[0]` + 1; `B` is the ASCII value of the letter in `l[1]` + 2; `A` and `B` are integers and equal; `ans` is 3; `C` is a list containing the ASCII values of the letters in `a`. `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`.
Output State: **`a` contains a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the single letter from `a`; `A` is the ASCII value of the letter in `l[0]` + 1; `B` is the ASCII value of the letter in `l[1]` + 2; `A` and `B` are integers and equal; `ans` is 3; `C` is a list containing the ASCII values of the letters in `a`. `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`.**
