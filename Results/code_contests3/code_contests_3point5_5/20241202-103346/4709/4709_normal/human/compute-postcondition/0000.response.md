Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the user's input using `raw_input()`, which reads a string from the user. The input consists of lowercase English letters, so `a` will contain a lowercase English letter. Therefore, the Output State is: Input consists of lowercase English letters; `a` contains a lowercase English letter.
Output State: **Input consists of lowercase English letters; `a` contains a lowercase English letter**
