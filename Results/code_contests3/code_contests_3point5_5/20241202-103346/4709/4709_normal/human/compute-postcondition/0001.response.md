Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the result of splitting the string stored in `a` based on whitespaces. Since `a` contains a lowercase English letter and `split()` will create a list of that single letter, the Output State is: Input consists of lowercase English letters; `a` contains a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the single letter from `a`.
Output State: **Input consists of lowercase English letters; `a` contains a lowercase English letter; `l` is a list containing the single letter from `a`**
