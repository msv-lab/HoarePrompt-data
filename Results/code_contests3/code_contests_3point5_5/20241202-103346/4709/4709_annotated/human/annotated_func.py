#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid where each square contains a lowercase English letter.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is a list containing 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid; `A` is the first row of the grid; `B` is the second row of the grid; `ans` is 1. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a list of 3 lists representing rows of the grid. `A` is the last row with an integer value less than the last `B`, `B` is the last row with an integer value greater than the last `A`, `ans` is updated based on the condition `C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]` for all rows. `C` is a list of characters obtained by converting each element `i` of the row to a string.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user which is expected to be a 3x3 grid where each square contains a lowercase English letter. It then processes the grid in an unspecified way, updating a variable `ans` based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The specific processing details of the grid are not specified in the annotations, leaving the exact functionality ambiguous.
