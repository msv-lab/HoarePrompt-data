Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the second list in `l`, which is the second row of the grid. The state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list containing 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid; `A` is the first row of the grid; `B` is the second row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid; `A` is the first row of the grid; `B` is the second row of the grid**
