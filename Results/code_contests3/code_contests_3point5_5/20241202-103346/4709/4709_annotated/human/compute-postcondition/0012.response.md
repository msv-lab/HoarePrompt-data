Postcondition: ***`l` is a list of 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid. `A` is the first row with an integer value less than `B`. `B` is the second row with an integer value greater than `A`. `ans` is 2. `C` is a list of characters obtained by converting each element `i` of the row to a string. If the characters in the first and fifth element of the row are the same, and the characters in the second and fourth element of the row are the same, then `ans` is updated to 2.***
