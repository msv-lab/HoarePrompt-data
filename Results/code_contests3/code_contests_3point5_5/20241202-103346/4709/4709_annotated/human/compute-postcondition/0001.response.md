Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list based on whitespace. Since the initial state is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, after splitting, `l` will be a list containing 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 lists, each representing a row of the grid**
