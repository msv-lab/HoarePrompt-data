Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not consider the case where Luba finishes reading the book before the end of the day. In this case, the program should not increment the day count. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2
86400 86398
```
The correct output should be 2, as Luba finishes reading on the second day. However, the program will output 3 because it increments the day count even though Luba finishes reading on the second day.
