According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. Since `t` is positive, the loop can execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 0**
