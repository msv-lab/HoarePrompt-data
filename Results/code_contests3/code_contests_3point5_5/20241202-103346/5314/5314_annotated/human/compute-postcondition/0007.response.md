Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 minus the integer value at index `i` in list `a`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than or equal to 86400. As the initial state of `t` is positive and greater than or equal to 86400, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400**
