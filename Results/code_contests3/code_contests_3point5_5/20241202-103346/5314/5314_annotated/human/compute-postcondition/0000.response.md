Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the list returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `t` can vary within the constraints mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6**
