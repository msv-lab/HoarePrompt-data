Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the value at index `i` in list `a`. The value of `t` will be updated accordingly based on the initial values of `t` and `a[i]`. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 0, `t` is updated based on the calculation t -= 86400 - int(a[i])**
