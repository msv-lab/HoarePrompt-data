Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input after splitting it. The variables `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, `a` is the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, `a` is the input after splitting**
