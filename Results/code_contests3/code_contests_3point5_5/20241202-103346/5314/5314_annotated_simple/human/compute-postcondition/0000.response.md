Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()` and then converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `t` depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided.**
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided.**
