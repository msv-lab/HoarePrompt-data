Functionality: ** The function reads two integers 'n' and 't' from the input, followed by a list of integers 'a'. It then iterates through the elements of 'a', decrementing 't' by the difference between 86400 and the current element of 'a'. The function prints the final value of 'i' after the loop, which represents the number of elements processed in 'a'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
