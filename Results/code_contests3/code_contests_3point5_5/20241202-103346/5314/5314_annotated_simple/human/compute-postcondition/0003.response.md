According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, `a` is the input after splitting, and `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, `a` is the input after splitting, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
