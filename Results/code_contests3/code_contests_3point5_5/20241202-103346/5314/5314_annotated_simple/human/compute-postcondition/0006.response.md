According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted so that it is still greater than 0 after the decrement. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on the input provided, `a` is the input after splitting, `i` is 1, `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`, for the loop to execute again `t` is still greater than 0**
