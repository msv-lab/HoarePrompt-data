Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program does not consider the case where Luba has free time left after finishing her work for the day. The program simply subtracts the time spent working each day from the total time required to read the book without checking if there is any remaining time for reading after completing the work.

In the problem description, it is stated that if some free time remains, Luba can spend it on reading. This crucial aspect is missing from the program. Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for.
