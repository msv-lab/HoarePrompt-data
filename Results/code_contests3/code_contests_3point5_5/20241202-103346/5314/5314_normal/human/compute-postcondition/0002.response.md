Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The initial state mentions the constraints on `n` and `t`, the list `ai`, and the values they can hold, but they are not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each ai is non-negative and does not exceed 86400, `i` is 0.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each ai is non-negative and does not exceed 86400, `i` is 0**
