Example Answer:
n and t are assigned values from the list obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of n and t are constrained as mentioned. The list ai contains n integers with the specified constraints.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each ai is non-negative and does not exceed 86400.**
