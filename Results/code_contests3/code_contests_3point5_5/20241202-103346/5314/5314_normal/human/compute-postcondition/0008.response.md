Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again only if `t` is greater than or equal to 86400. After the execution, the value of `t` will be decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400, `ai` contains `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
