Example Answer:
`t` is decremented by the result of 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is an integer. The range of possible values for `a[i]` is not specified, so the value of t after execution will vary. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, ai contains n integers, and i is 0, t is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, ai contains n integers, and i is 0, t is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
