Example Answer:
`t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is a specific integer, and `t` is a specific integer greater than or equal to 86400. After execution, `t` will be decremented by a specific value calculated from `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400, `ai` contains `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400, `ai` contains `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
