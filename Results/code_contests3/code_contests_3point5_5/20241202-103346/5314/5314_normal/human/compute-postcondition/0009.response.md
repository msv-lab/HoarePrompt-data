According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be greater than or equal to 86400. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400, `ai` contains `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
