Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`. The initial state does not provide the values of `a` or `i`, so the exact value of `t` after the decrement cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, ai contains n integers; i is incremented by 1, and t is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, ai contains n integers; i is incremented by 1, and t is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
