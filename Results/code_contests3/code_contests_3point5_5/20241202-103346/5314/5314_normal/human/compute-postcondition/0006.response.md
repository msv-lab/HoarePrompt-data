According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `t` should be adjusted to greater than or equal to 86400. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and for the loop to execute again t is greater than or equal to 86400, ai contains n integers; i is incremented by 1, and t is decremented by 86400 - `a[i`]**
