Example Answer:
The input is split based on whitespace and stored in list `a`. The values of `n`, `t`, and the elements of list `ai` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each ai is non-negative and does not exceed 86400.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each ai is non-negative and does not exceed 86400.**
