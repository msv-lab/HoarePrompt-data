According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^6. No adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n and t are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, ai contains n integers, and i is 0**
