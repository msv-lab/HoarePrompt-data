Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`. The loop will execute again if `t` is still greater than or equal to 86400. The values of `n` and `ai` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than or equal to 86400, `ai` contains `n` integers; `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is decremented by 86400 - `a[i]`**
