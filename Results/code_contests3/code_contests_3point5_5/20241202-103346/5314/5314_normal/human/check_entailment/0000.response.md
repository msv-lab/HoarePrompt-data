Correctness: **False**

The given code does not always follow the problem description. The code iterates through the list of work hours and subtracts each day's work hours from the total reading time until the reading time becomes non-positive. However, the code does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading exactly on the last day. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3 2
86400 86398 2
```
The code will output 3, which is incorrect. Luba finishes reading on the 2nd day, not the 3rd day. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
