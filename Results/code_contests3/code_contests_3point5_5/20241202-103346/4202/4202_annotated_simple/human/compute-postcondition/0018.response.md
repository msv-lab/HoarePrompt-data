Functionality: **The function `func` reads input strings `a` and `b`, which consist of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000. It then counts the occurrences of '1' in each string and prints 'YES' if the count of '1' characters in `a` is greater than or equal to the count in `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return anything.**
