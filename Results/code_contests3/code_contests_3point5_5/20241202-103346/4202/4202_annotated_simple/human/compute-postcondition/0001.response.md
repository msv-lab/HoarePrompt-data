According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one character input from `raw_input()`. Since the input can be any character, we need to ensure that the loop executes for any possible input. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` and `b` can remain unchanged, `pa` should be 0, and `i` should be the first character input from `raw_input()`.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character input from `raw_input()`**
