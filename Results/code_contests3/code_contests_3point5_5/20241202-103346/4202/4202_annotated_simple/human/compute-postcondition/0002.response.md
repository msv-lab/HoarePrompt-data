Example Answer: 
`pa` is incremented by 1 whenever `i` is equal to '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 0, and the initial value of `i` is the first character input from `raw_input()`. Therefore, after execution, `pa` will be incremented by 1 if the first character is '1'. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000; `pa` is the count of '1' characters in the input string.**
