Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the count of '1' characters in both strings a and b, and then checks if the count of '1' characters in a is greater than or equal to the count of '1' characters in b. If it is, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to turn a into b. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program follows the problem description by correctly determining if it is possible to turn string a into string b using the given operations. It handles all potential cases and produces the correct output.
