Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes two strings, `a` and `b`, which consist only of "0" and "1" characters. The length of strings `a` and `b` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function calculates the total count of '1's in each string (`pa` and `pb`) and then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
