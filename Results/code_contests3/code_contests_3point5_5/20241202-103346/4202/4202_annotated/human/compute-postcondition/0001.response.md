According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters to iterate over in the input provided by the user. Since the input can have a maximum length of 1000 characters, we need to ensure that there is at least 1 character in the input for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only the characters "0" and "1" with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `pa` is 0, the input provided by the user at least has 1 character**
