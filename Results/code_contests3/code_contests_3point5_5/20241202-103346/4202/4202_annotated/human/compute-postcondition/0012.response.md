Example Answer: 
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` can either be 0 or 1, depending on the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1, the input string has at least 1 character, and `pb` has been incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1, the input string has at least 1 character, and `pb` has been incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'**
