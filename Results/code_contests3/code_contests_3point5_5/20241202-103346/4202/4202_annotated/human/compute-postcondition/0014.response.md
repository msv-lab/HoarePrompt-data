Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the new current character `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` is either 0 or 1, and the current character `i` is either '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', then `pb` will be incremented by 1, making it either 1 or 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0, 1, or 2.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0, 1, or 2**
