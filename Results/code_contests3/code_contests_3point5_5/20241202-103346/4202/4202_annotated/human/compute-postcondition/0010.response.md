Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The initial value of `pb` is 0, and `i` can be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, after execution, the value of `pb` will be 1 if `i` is '1' and 0 if `i` is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only the characters "0" and "1" with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input provided by the user, `pb` is 0 or 1, the input string has at least 1 character**
