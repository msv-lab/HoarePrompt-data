Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program calculates the number of '1's in both strings 'a' and 'b' and then compares them. If the number of '1's in 'a' is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in 'b', it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This logic is in line with the problem description as it checks if it is possible to turn string 'a' into string 'b' based on the number of '1's. The program handles all potential cases and works correctly for the given problem description.
