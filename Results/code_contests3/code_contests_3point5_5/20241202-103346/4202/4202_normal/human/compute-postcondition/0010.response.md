Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The value of `i` can either be '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', `pb` will increase by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character '1' is encountered in the input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character '1' is encountered in the input string**
