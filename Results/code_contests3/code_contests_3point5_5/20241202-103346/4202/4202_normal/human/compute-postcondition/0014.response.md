Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, but we know that `i` is a character from the string `a` or `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 2 and 1001, `pa` and `pb` are updated based on the new input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 2 and 1001, `pa` and `pb` are updated based on the new input string**
