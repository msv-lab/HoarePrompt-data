Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The previous values of `pb` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, `pa` and `pb` are updated based on the new input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, `pa` and `pb` are updated based on the new input string**
