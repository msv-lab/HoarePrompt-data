According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string. Therefore, the loop will execute if the input string is not empty. Before the loop starts, `pa` represents the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, and `pb` is assigned the value 0. To ensure the loop execution, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input string is not empty.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the input string is not empty**
