According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings with "0" and "1" characters, and `pa` is either 0 or 1. To execute the loop one more time, the input string must have at least one more character to iterate over.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute one more time the input string length must be greater than the current length**
