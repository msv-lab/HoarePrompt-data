Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The length of `a` and `b` is not specified so we cannot determine the exact values, but `pa` will be incremented accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (incremented if `i` is '1'), for the loop to execute one more time the input string length must be greater than the current length.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (incremented if `i` is '1'), for the loop to execute one more time the input string length must be greater than the current length**
