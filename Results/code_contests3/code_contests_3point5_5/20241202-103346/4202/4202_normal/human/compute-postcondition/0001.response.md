According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input. Since the length of `a` and `b` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive, the loop will definitely execute. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is the first character in the input string.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in the input string**
