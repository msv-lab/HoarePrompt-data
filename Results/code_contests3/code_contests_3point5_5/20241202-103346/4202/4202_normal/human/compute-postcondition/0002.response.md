Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'. The value of `i` can only be '0' or '1' based on the initial state. If `i` is '1', then `pa` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, `pa` will be 0 or 1 based on the value of the first character in the input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is either 0 or 1**
