Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pa` is unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute one more time the input string length must be greater than the current length, `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute one more time the input string length must be greater than the current length, `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
