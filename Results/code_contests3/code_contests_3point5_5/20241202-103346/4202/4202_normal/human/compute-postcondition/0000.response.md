Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and the length of a and b is between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and the length of a and b is between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is 0**
