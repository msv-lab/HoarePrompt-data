Functionality: The function calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in two input strings a and b, and then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in a is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in b; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not actually perform a bitwise XOR operation between the strings a and b as mentioned in the annotation. It only compares the counts of '1's in the two strings and prints the result based on that. Missing functionality includes performing the XOR operation or returning the result as a new string.
