Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the parity of strings a and b by counting the number of '1's in each string. Then, it prints "YES" if the parity of a is greater than or equal to the parity of b, and "NO" otherwise. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
