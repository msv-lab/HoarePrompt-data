The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the predefined variables n, m, li, and ri. The constraints on these variables are specified in the prompt. After executing the function, it returns a specific output based on the operation performed on these variables. Unfortunately, the specific functionality of the function cannot be determined without additional context or information on how these variables are manipulated within the function.
