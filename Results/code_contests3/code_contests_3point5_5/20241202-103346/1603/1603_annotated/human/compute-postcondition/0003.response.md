Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, then prints a string based on the value of `n`. It repeats the string '10' a number of times equal to half of `n`, and if `n` is odd, it appends '1' to the end of the string. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and operates solely on the input values of `n` and `m`.**
