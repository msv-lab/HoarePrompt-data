Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. It simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times and adds '1' if n is odd. This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty as required by the problem description. 

For example, consider the input:
5 2
1 3
3 5

The correct output should be "01100" to maximize the beauty, but the program will output "101" which is not the optimal solution. 

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and the correctness is **False**.
