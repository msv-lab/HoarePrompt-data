Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a string consisting of '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' at the end if n is odd. Given that n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000, the output string will have '10' repeated n//2 times with an additional '1' at the end if n is odd.
Output State: **Output is a string based on the value of n**
