The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined variables `n`, `m`, `l_i`, and `r_i`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3. Each segment defined by l_i and r_i has 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The function does not return any specific value as the output is not defined in the given context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined variables n, m, l_i, and r_i, where n and m are integers satisfying certain constraints. Each segment defined by l_i and r_i also satisfies specific constraints. The function does not have a specific return value defined.**
