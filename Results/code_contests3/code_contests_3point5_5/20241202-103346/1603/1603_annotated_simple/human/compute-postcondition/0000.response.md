Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `n` and `m` range from 1 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 1000**.
