Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not generate the correct output based on the problem description. The program simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is odd. This does not take into account the visitors' segments and their preferences for roses and lilies. The program should be modified to consider the visitors' segments and maximize the beauty of each segment as described in the problem description.
