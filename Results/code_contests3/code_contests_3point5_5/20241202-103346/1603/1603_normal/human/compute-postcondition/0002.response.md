The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the sum of all valid segments [l_i, r_i] based on the constraints provided. The parameters n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3. Each segment [l_i, r_i] is valid, where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the sum of all valid segments [l_i, r_i].
