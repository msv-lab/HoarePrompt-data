Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values by splitting the input based on spaces. Since the values of `n` and `m` are integers within the specified range, the values are stored accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers within the specified range**
