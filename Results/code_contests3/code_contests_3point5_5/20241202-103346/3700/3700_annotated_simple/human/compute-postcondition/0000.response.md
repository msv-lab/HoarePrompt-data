Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `H` and `N` are determined by the input values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9**
