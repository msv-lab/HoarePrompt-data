Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. The sum is then assigned to variable `s`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `N`, `K`, or `H_i`, the output state will only include the fact that `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user.
Output State: **`s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user**
