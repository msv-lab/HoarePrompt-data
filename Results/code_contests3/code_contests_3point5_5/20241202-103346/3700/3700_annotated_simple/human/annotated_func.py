#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, the function returns True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of variables `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two variables `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to the variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning. However, the code lacks information on the input parameter `mod` and how it affects the function. Additionally, there is no handling for cases where `mod` is not defined or if `a` and `b` are not integers, which could potentially impact the function's behavior.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.**
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, the program continues with the sum `s`. If `s` is less than `H`, the program prints 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N`, where `H` represents a target value and `N` represents the number of integers to be summed. It then reads `N` integers and calculates their sum. If the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for `H` and `N`.
