The function func_1 accepts two variables `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to the variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning. However, the code lacks information on the input parameter `mod` and how it affects the function. Additionally, there is no handling for cases where `mod` is not defined or if `a` and `b` are not integers, which could potentially impact the function's behavior.
