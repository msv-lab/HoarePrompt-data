The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N`, where `H` represents a target value and `N` represents the number of integers to be summed. It then reads `N` integers and calculates their sum. If the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for `H` and `N`.
