The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to the variable mod, the function subtracts mod from the sum before returning it. However, the actual code does not handle cases where `mod` is not defined or initialized. Therefore, if `mod` is not provided or initialized, the function might encounter an error.
