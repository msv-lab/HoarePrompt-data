Postcondition: ***`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i; `H` and `N` are assigned input integers, `s` is the sum of integers entered through input split by spaces. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, the program executes the if part. If the sum of integers entered through input split by spaces is less than `H`, the program executes the else part.***
