Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints 'Yes' without any impact on the variables `N`, `K`, `H_i`, `H`, or `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i; `H` and `N` are assigned input integers, `s` is the sum of integers entered through input split by spaces. The sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i; `H` and `N` are assigned input integers, `s` is the sum of integers entered through input split by spaces. The sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`.**
