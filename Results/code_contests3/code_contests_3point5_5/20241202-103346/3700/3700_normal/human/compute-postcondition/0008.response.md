Functionality: **The function func_2 reads two integers H and N from user input, calculates the sum of N integers entered through input, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. The program does not accept any parameters and performs these operations internally based on user input.**
