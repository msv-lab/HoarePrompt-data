Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of `H` and `N` are not known beforehand, so the output state is: `N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i; `H` and `N` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i; `H` and `N` are assigned input integers**
