Postcondition: ***`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, `H_i` are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers; `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input. The sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`***
