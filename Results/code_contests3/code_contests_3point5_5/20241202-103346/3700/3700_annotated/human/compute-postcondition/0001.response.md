Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of all the integers obtained from splitting the input string. The sum is stored in variable `s`. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, H_i are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers; `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, H_i are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers; `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input**
