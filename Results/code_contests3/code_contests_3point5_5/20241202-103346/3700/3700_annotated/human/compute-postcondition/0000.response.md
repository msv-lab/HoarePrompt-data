Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of `H` and `N` are dependent on the input given, so the exact values cannot be determined without knowing the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, H_i are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5, H_i are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers**
