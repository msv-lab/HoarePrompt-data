The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates their sum, and returns the sum only if it is greater than or equal to the value of mod. If the sum of a and b is greater than or equal to mod, it subtracts mod from the sum and returns the result. If the sum of a and b is less than mod, the function does not modify the sum and returns it as is.
