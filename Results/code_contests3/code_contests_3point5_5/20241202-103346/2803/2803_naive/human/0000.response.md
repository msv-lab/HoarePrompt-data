Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program calculates the xor-sum incorrectly and does not handle all potential cases. 

For example, if we take the input (6, 6) as mentioned in the problem description, the expected output should be 7 because Grisha can take all six candies to obtain the xor-sum of 7. However, the program outputs 3 for this input, which is incorrect. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
