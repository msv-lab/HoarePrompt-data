Example Answer:
The code calculates `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` if `k - 1` is true, otherwise it prints `n`. The value of `k - 1` is not given, but if it is true, then `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` is calculated, otherwise `n` is printed. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
