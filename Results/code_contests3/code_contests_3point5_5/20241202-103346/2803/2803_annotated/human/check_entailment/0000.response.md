Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` as input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then calculates the largest possible xor-sum based on the values of `n` and `k` using bitwise operations, as specified in the problem description. The program uses the formula `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n` to determine the largest xor-sum and prints it. This formula is correct and provides the expected output for the given problem.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
