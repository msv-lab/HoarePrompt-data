Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints the result based on the conditions provided in the problem description. If `k - 1` is non-zero, it computes `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which represents the largest xor-sum Grisha can obtain. Otherwise, it simply returns `n` as the largest xor-sum, which is also in line with the problem description. The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description and the output hints also agree with the code.
