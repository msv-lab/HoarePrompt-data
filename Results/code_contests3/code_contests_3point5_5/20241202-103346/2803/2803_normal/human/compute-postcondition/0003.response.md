Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints the result based on the conditions: if `k - 1` is non-zero, it computes `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function operates under the constraint that `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.**
