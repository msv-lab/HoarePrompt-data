Example Answer:
n and k are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using the `split()` function and converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of n and k are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18**
