The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates a mathematical operation based on the values of n and k, which are integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function then returns the result of the mathematical operation. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate a mathematical operation based on the values of n and k, and return the result.
