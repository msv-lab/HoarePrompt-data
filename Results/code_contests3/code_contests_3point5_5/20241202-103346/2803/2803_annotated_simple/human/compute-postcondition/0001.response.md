Example Answer:
The code calculates the value to be printed based on the condition `k - 1`. If `k - 1` is true, it prints `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. The value of `n` and `k` are given to be integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18. Depending on the value of `k - 1`, either `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` or `n` will be printed.
Output State: **Depending on the condition `k - 1`, either the calculated value `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` or `n` will be printed.**
