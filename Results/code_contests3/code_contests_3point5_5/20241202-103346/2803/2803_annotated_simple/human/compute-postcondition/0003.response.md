Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then performs a mathematical operation and prints the result. If k is greater than 1, it calculates 2 to the power of the length of the binary representation of n, subtracts 1 from it, and prints the result. If k is 1, it directly prints the value of n. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate and print a specific mathematical operation based on the values of n and k.**
