Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes the input values for n and k. It then calculates the largest possible xor-sum based on the given constraints. The program uses bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the xor-sum. It follows the problem description by considering the xor-sum of the candies to determine the maximum happiness that Grisha can obtain. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and provides the correct output.
