According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `row` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is obtained by replacing all '9's with '1's in `row`, `i` is the second character in `row`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute the second time:
- `res` remains the same
- `T` remains the same
- `t` remains the same
- `row` remains the same
- `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`:
  - If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'
  - If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`
- `i` is updated to point to the next character in `row` for the loop to execute the second time.

State: **`res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is the third character in `row` for the loop to execute the second time**
