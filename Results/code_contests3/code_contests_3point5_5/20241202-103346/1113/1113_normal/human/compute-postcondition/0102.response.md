Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` has '1' appended to it to indicate one more loop execution, and `i` is '1'. If `i` is '9', the state remains the same. Otherwise, `nRow` is '11'.***
