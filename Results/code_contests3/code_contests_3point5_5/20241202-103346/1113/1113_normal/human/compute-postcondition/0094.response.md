Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is '9' at the end of the if else block. If `i` is '9', then `res` remains the same. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` gets updated by concatenating the previous value of `nRow` with the value of `i`.***
