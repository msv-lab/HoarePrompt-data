Example Answer:
The input string `row` is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces. The list `res` and string `nRow` are updated by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped `row`. The value of `t` remains the same at 10, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is set to 9.
Output State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `i` is 9**
