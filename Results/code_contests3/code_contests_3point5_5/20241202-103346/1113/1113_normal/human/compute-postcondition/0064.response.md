Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The variable `nRow` is a string that replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in `row`. All other variables remain the same as the initial state.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `nRow` will be a string that replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in `row`. All other variables remain the same as the initial state.**
