Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is an io.BytesIO() object, `input` is assigned the lambda function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`, `maxint` is assigned the float value infinity, `res` is a list containing the value of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `i` is 10, `row` is a non-empty string, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after replacing occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in `row`, `nRow` is an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `i` is concatenated to the existing value of `nRow`.***
