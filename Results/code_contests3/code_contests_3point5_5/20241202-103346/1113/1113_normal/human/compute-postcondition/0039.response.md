Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is an io.BytesIO() object, `input` is assigned the lambda function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`, `maxint` is assigned the float value infinity, `res` is a list containing the value of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input string, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must not be empty. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `res` is a list containing the value of `nRow + i`.***
