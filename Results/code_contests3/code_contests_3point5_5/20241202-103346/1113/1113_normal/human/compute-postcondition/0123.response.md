Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is determined based on the last character `i` in the string `row`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise, `i` is concatenated with `nRow`. Then `nRow` is added to the list `res`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all '9's with '1's in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` for the loop to execute the last time, and `nRow` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all '9's with '1's in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` for the loop to execute the last time, and `nRow` is appended to `res`**
