Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the initial value of `nRow` is unknown, so the output state is: `res` is a list of strings, `T` is the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`res` is a list of strings, `T` is the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated accordingly**
