Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is the fourth character in `row` for the loop to execute the second time. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
