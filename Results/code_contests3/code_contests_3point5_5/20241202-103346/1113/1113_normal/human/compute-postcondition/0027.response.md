According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 so `i` becomes 9.
State: **`sys.stdout` is an io.BytesIO() object, `input` is assigned the lambda function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline, `write` is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`, `maxint` is assigned the float value infinity, `res` is a list containing the value of `nRow`, `T` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input string, `nRow` is a string containing '1's in place of '9's**.
