According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the string `row`. In order for the loop to execute, `row` must have at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` should be 9 for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `res` needs to contain the appended `nRow` and `nRow` should be an empty string.
State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one character, `nRow` is a string containing the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in `row`, `i` is 9 for the loop to execute again, `res` now contains the appended `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string**
