Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` has more characters left to iterate, `nRow` is '11' if the first character in `row` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is the first character in `row` and `nRow` is concatenated with `i` if i == '9'.***
