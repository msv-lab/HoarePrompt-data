Functionality: **The function `func` reads input consisting of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters from '1' to '9'. It then replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and stores the modified strings in a list `res`. Finally, it prints the modified strings separated by newlines. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have specified return values.**
