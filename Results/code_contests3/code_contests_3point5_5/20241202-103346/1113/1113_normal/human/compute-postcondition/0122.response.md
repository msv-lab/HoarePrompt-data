Output State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all '9's with '1's in `row`, `i` is the last character in `row` for the loop to execute the last time. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.**
