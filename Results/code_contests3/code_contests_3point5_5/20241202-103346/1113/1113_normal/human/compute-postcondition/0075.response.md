Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`. `T` is the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated accordingly. If the character `i` is equal to '9', then `res` will be updated by replacing '9' with '1' in the corresponding positions of each string in `res`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will contain all characters in `row` where '9' is replaced by '1'.***
