Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1', which means the length of `nRow` increases by 1. The previous value of `nRow` is '11' if the first character in `row` is '9', otherwise, `nRow` is the next character in `row`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` has more characters left to iterate, and `nRow` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` has more characters left to iterate, `nRow` is updated accordingly**
