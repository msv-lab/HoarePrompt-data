Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is the third character in `row` for the loop to execute the second time. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated with an additional '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`.***
