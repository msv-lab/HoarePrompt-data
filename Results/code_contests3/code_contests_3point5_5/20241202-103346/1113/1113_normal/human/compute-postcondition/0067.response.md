According to the code, the loop will iterate 9 times, so the loop will execute the next time when `i` is increased by 1. Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will run for 9 iterations, the next time the loop will execute when `i` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 9, and `res` will be a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`.
State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` is the same, `t` is 9**.
