Example Answer: 
The `write` variable is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`, which writes to the standard output. The lambda function registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output at exit and the assignment of the lambda function to `input` are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout` is an io.BytesIO() object with the lambda function registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output at exit, `input` is assigned the lambda function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline, `write` is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is an io.BytesIO() object with the lambda function registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output at exit, `input` is assigned the lambda function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline, `write` is assigned the `write` method from `sys.stdout`**
