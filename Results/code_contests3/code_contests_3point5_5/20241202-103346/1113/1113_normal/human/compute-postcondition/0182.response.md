Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`, so the final `res` would contain the initial strings where all '9's were replaced by '1's, and the new `nRow` string is added. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one character, `nRow` is a string containing the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in `row`, `i` is either '9' or 9, and `res` contains the final appended `nRow` with `nRow` being a string of '1' for every '9' in `row`.
Output State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one character, `nRow` is a string containing the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in `row`, `i` is either '9' or 9, and `res` contains the final appended `nRow` with `nRow` being a string of '1' for every '9' in `row`**
