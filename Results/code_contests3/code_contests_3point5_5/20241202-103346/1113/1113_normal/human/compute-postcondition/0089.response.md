According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input string `row`. The loop will execute one more time when `i` is 9. However, based on the initial state provided, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, and `nRow` is an empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 9 and `nRow` should not be empty.

State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the corresponding input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and has at least 1 character, `nRow` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 9**
