Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one character, `nRow` is a string containing the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in `row`, `i` can be '9' or 9, and `res` contains the appended `nRow` with `nRow` being a string of '1' for every '9' in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` should still have characters left to iterate over and `res` should be updated to include the new `nRow` string. In the if part, the `res` list remains unchanged, and in the else part, `res` is updated to include `nRow` concatenated with the value of `i`.***
