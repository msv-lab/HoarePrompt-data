According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state so that `row` is not empty. Additionally, the value of `i` being 9 does not affect the loop execution, so it can remain as is. 
State: **`res` is a list of strings where each string is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' based on the characters in the stripped input string `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 10, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one character, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9 for the loop to execute**
