According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `row`. If `i` is the third character in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the third character in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` should be updated with an additional '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` should be increased by the value of `i`.

State: **`res` is a list of strings based on `row`, `T` remains the same, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is the fourth character in `row` for the loop to execute the second time.**
