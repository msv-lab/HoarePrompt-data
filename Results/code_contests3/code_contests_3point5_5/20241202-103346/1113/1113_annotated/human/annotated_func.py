    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `input` is assigned the value `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing strings where all occurrences of '9' are replaced with '1' in each row, `T` is an integer input and greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T - 1`, `i` is 8, `row` is the input value after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is a string where all occurrences of '9' in `row` are replaced with '1`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function manipulates the input data by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of a 9x9 grid. It then outputs the modified grid. The function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and writes the modified grid to the standard output.
