Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned the value `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing strings where all occurrences of '9' are replaced with '1', `T` is an integer input and greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 8, `row` is the input value after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is a string containing the concatenation of values of `i` in each iteration of the loop where `i` ranges from 0 to 8. If `i` is equal to '9', the function does not change the state of any variable. If `i` is not equal to '9', the string `nRow` will have the concatenation of values of `i` for each iteration of the loop ranging from 0 to 8.***
