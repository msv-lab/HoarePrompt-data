Example Answer:
The variable `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. No other variables are affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity**
