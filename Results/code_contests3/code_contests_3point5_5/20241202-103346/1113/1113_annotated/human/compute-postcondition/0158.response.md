According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the non-empty list `row`. If there are more elements left in the list `row`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, all variables are incremented by 10, `i` is 19. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res'. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is '1919' and is appended to `res`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 29, `row` is a non-empty list. If `i` is '19', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res`. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is '2929' and is appended to `res`.**
