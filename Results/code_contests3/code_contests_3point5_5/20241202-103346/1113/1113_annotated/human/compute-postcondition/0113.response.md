Postcondition: ***All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string and '1' appended to it for each occurrence of '9'. `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is the original `nRow` string with an additional '1' at the end due to the concatenation operation. If `i` is not equal to '9', the state remains the same as the precondition.***
