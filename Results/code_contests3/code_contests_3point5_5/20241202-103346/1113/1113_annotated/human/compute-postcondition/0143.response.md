Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are integers. If the loop executes, all variables are incremented by 10, `i` becomes the length of `row`, `row` retains its original input value, and `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.**
