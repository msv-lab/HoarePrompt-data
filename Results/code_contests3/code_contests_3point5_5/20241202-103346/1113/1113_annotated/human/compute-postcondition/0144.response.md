Example Answer:
`res` appends the value of `nRow`, where `nRow` is obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. All variables are incremented by 10, `i` becomes the length of `row`, and `row` retains its original input value. 
Output State: **All variables are incremented by 10, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` retains its original input value, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `res` contains the appended `nRow`.**
