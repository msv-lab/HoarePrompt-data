Example Answer:
Initially, `i` is 99, `row` is a non-empty list, all variables are incremented by 10. Then, based on the condition, `nRow` is assigned '1' if `i` is '99' and '9919192929' if `i` is not '99'. After that, '9919192929919192929' is appended to `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 109, `row` is a non-empty list, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'].
Output State: **`i` is 109, `row` is a non-empty list, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']**
