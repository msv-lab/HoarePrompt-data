Example Answer:
The code snippet `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` redirects the standard output to a BytesIO object named `sys.stdout`. This means that any output produced by the program will be captured and stored in the BytesIO object for further processing. Since this code snippet does not affect any other variables, the initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **Each test case consists of 9 lines, each line consists of 9 characters from 1 to 9 without any whitespaces.**
