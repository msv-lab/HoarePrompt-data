Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the stripped input value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` incremented by 10, `t` incremented by 10, `i` is 0, `row` is the input value, `nRow`.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` incremented by 10, `t` incremented by 10, `i` is 0, `row` is the input value, `nRow`**
