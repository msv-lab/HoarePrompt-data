Example Answer:
Since the code snippet `res = []` initializes a new list `res`, it does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list.
Output State: **`input` is assigned the value `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list**
