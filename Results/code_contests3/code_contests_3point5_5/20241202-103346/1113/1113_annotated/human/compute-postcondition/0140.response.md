Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` depends on the input value of `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10, `i` is 2, `row` is the input value, `nRow` is the previous value of `row` appended with '1'.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10, `i` is 2, `row` is the input value, `nRow` is the previous value of `row` appended with '1'**
