According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 2, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is either '11' if `i` is equal to '9' or the value of `i` concatenated with '1' if `i` is not equal to '9' and `nRow` increased by `i`.

To adjust for the next iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` need to be increased by 2 again. `row` should not be empty for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 4, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is adjusted accordingly**
