Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` contains '1'. Since `i` is 19 and not '9', '1' is appended to `res`. The initial state variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 19, `row` is a non-empty list, `nRow` contains '1', '1' is appended to `res`.
Output State: **All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 19, `row` is a non-empty list, `nRow` contains '1', '1' is appended to `res'**
