Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, so the value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` followed by the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1' and if `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the value of the second element `i` in `row` and `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
