Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of the variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is increased by 1, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow`.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is increased by 1, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow`**
