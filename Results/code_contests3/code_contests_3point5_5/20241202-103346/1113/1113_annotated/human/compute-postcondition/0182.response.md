Example Answer:
If the last element of `row` is '9', then `nRow` will be a string of '1's equal to the number of '9's in `row`. If the last element of `row` is not '9', then `nRow` will contain the last element of `row` concatenated with the previous elements of `row` excluding any '9's. The `res` list will have `nRow` appended to it.
Output State: **`i` is the last element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is either a string of '1's equal to the number of '9's in `row` or contains the last element of `row` concatenated with the previous elements of `row` excluding any '9's.**
