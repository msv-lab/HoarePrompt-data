Example Answer:
`nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, which is already increased by 4. So, `nRow` is increased by 8. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 4, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is increased by 8.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 4, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is increased by 8**
