According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `row`, and `nRow`. If the value of `i` is '9', the loop can execute again with `nRow` being '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` should contain the value of the first element `i` in `row`, and `nRow` should not be equal to '9'. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, and `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` should be '1'.
2. If the value of `i` is not '9', then `nRow` should contain the value of the first element `i` in `row`, and `nRow` should not be equal to '9'.

State: **`i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], for the loop to execute again either `nRow` is '1' if `i` is '9', or `nRow` contains the value of the first element `i` in `row` and `nRow` is not equal to '9'**
