According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10, `i` is 1, `row` is the input value. If `i` equals '9', `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is '1' or '0123456789'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `row` should still be valid and the value of `i` should be updated accordingly.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10, `i` is 2, `row` is the input value**
