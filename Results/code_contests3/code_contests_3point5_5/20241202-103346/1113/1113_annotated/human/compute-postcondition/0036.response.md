According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', the loop can execute again if `nRow` contains '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again if `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows:
* `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are as described.
* If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains '1'.
* If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are as described. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains '2'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.**
