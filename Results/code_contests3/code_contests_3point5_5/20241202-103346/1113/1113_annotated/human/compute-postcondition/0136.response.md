Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by adding '1' to its value. Depending on the initial value of `i`, if `i` is not equal to '9', then the new value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of the current value of `nRow` and '1'. So if `i` is 1, the new value of `nRow` will be '101'. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` will simply be incremented by adding '1', resulting in '2'. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10. `i` is 1. `row` is the input value. `nRow` is '101' or '2'.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t` are incremented by 10. `i` is 1. `row` is the input value. `nRow` is '101' or '2'**
