According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `row` string. The loop will execute 10 times if `row` has at least 10 characters. For the loop to execute the tenth time, `i` should be less than 9. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, and `i` is less than 9.
