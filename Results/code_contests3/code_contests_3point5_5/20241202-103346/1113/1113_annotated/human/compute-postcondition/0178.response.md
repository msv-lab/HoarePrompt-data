Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will be '11' since `nRow` was set to '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` will be the value of the second element in `row` followed by '1' since it was concatenated with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
