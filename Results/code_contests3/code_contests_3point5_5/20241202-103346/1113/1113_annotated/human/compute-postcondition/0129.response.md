According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the iterable `row`. Since `row` is the input value, we can assume it will have elements. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to 0, indicating the loop will start from the first element of `row`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` incremented by 10, `t` incremented by 10, `i` is 0, `row` is the input value, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0 and `row` has elements**
