According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times in total. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 109. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` should be 110. The loop condition does not depend on `row` or `res`, so they can remain unchanged.
State: **`i` is 110, `row` is a non-empty list, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']**
