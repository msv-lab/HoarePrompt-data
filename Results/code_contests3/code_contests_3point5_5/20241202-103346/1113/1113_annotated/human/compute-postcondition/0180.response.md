Postcondition: ***`i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the value of the second element `i` in `row` and `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. In both cases, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.***
