According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is increased by 1, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is increased by 1, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
