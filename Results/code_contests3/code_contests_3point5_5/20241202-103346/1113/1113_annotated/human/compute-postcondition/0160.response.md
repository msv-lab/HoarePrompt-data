Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, which is '2929'. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes '292929'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 29, `row` is a non-empty list, `res` contains '292929'.
Output State: **`i` is 29, `row` is a non-empty list, `res` contains '292929'**
