According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than 9 and `row` is a non-empty list. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are incremented by 10, `i` is less than 9, `row` is a non-empty list. The loop is executing for the 10th time, so for it to execute one more time, `i` needs to reach 9. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` should be 19 to satisfy the condition `i` is less than 9.

State: **All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 19, `row` is a non-empty list. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res`.**
