Postcondition: ***All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1. `row` contains at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string. `i` is less than 9 and the next `i` value is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` has the updated string after appending the next `i` value.***
