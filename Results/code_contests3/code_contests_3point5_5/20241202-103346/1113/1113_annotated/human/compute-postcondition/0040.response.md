According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `row`, and `nRow`. If `i` is equal to '9', the loop will not execute again. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are as described. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains '2'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are as described. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
