Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1'. If `nRow` was '9', then it becomes '91'. If `nRow` was any other value, it just appends '1' to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the previous value.
Output State: **`i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929'], `nRow` is updated based on the previous value**
