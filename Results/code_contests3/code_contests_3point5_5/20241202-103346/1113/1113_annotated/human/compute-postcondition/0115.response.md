Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' at the end. The initial value of `nRow` is unknown, but after executing the code, '1' is appended to `nRow`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the modified string with an additional '1' at the end.
