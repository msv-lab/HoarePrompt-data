Postcondition: ***`i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']. If the value of `i` is '9', `nRow` is '1' for the loop to execute. If the value of `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the value of the first element `i` in `row`, and `nRow` is not equal to '9'.***
