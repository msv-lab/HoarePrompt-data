According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times as the range specifies. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are incremented by 10, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` retains its original input value, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `res` contains the appended `nRow`. Since the loop has executed 9 times, for it to execute one more time, the new state should be:
State: **All variables are incremented by 10, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` retains its original input value, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `res` contains the appended `nRow`, for the loop to execute a tenth time, `i` should be less than 9**
