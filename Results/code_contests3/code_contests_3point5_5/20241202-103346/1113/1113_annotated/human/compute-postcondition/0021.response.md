According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, `nRow` is '01'. Since `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` should be adjusted to 36 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables retain their initial values. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '36'**.
