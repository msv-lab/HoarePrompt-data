Postcondition: ***All variables (`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow`) are integers. If `i` is equal to '9', then all variables are incremented by 10, `i` becomes 2, `row` retains its original input value, and `nRow` is the previous value of `row` appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then all variables are incremented by 10, `i` becomes 2, `row` retains its original input value, and `nRow` is increased by 2.***
