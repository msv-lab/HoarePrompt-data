According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 1, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is equal to '9' or the value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'. For the loop to execute one more time, the `row` must not be empty.
