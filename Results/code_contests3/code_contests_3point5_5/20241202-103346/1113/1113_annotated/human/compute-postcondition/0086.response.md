According to the code, the loop can execute for a total of 9 times since the range is specified as 9. At the end of the last iteration, the variables have specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` should be incremented by 1 and should be less than 9.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `row` is unchanged, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be less than 9**
