Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so the value of `nRow` will be the original `row` string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1' followed by '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, `i` is less than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, `i` is less than 9, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'**
