Output State: **All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 29, `row` is a non-empty list. If `i` is '19', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res`. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is '29291' and is appended to `res`.**
