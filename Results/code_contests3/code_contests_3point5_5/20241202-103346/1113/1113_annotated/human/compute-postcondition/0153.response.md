Postcondition: ***All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is less than 9, `row` is a non-empty list. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res`. The loop executes a tenth time, and the final state of the program is determined by the conditions met in the if-else block.***
