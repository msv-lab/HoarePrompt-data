According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, `i` is less than 9. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. Since `i` is less than 9 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and appended to `nRow`.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1, `row` contains at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string, `i` is less than 9, the next `i` value is appended to `nRow`**
