Example Answer:
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are incremented by 10, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` retains its original input value, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the appended `nRow`, for the loop to execute a tenth time, `i` should be less than 9.
