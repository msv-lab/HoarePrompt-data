Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is determined by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the string `row`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by the total number of elements in `row`, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is the value obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by the total number of elements in `row`, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is the value obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string**
