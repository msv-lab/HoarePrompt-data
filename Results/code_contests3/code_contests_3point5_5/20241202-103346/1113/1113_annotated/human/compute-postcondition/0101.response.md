Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the string `nRow`. Since all variables are incremented by 1 in the initial state, the updated string `nRow` will contain the appended value of `i+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1. `row` contains at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the updated string after appending the next `i+1` value based on the conditions described.
Output State: **All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 1. `row` contains at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the updated string after appending the next `i+1` value based on the conditions described.**
