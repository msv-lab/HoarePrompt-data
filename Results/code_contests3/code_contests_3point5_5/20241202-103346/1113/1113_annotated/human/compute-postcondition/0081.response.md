Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its current value. Since `i` is not mentioned in the initial state and there is no conditional check on `i`, we assume `i` is not equal to '9'. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` would be the concatenation of the existing value of `nRow` and '1'.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned specific values. `nRow` is updated with the concatenation of the new `i` value**
