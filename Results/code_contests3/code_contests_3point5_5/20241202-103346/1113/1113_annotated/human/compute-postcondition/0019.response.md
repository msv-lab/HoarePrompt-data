Example Answer:
`nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, where `i` is less than '9'. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments in each iteration, `nRow` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than '9', `nRow` is the sum of all values of `i` from 1 to 8.
Output State: **`i` is less than '9', `nRow` is 36**
