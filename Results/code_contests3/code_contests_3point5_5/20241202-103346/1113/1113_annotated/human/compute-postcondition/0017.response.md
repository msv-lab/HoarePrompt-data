According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `nRow`. If `i` is less than '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. Since `i` is equal to '9', the loop will not execute again unless `i` is adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than '9'.
State: **All variables retain their initial values. If `i` is less than '9', `nRow` is '0'.**
