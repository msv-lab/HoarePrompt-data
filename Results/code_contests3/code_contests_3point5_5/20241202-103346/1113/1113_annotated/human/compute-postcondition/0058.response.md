Postcondition: ***`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are increased by 2, `row` is the stripped input value, `nRow` is either '11' if `i` is equal to '9' or the value of `i` concatenated with '1' if `i` is not equal to '9' and `nRow` increased by `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must not be empty***
