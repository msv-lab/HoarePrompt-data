Postcondition: ***All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 12 characters if i is equal to '9'. Otherwise, all variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 11 characters. `nRow` is equal to the sum of its previous value and `i`.***
