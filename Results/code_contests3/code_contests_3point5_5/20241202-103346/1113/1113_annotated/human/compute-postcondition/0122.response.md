Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are all incremented by 10. `row` remains the same as the initial state. `nRow` contains the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original `row` string and appending '1' for each occurrence of '9'.**
