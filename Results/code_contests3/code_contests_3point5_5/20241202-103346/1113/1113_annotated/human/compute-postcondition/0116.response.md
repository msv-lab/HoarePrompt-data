Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, which is 10, resulting in `nRow` being extended by '10'. Since the next character in `row` is not '9', no additional '1' is added at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the modified string with '10'.
Output State: **All variables `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i` are incremented by 10. `row` contains a string with at least 10 characters. `nRow` contains the modified string with '10'**
