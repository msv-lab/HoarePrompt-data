According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` have specific values. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to concatenate the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should not be equal to '9' and `nRow` should be updated with the concatenation of the new `i` value.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`, `nRow` are assigned specific values. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` should be updated with the concatenation of the new `i` value**
