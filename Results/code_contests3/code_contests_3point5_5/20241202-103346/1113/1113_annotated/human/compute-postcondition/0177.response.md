According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` and `i`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the value of the first element `i` in `row` and `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must have more elements, and `i` should be the next element in `row`.
State: **`i` is the second element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `res` contains ['9919192929919192929']. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the value of the second element `i` in `row` and `nRow` is concatenated with `i`**
