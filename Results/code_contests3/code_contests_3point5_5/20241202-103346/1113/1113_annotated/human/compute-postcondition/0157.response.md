Postcondition: ***All variables are incremented by 10. `i` is 19, `row` is a non-empty list. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains '1' and is appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the appended value of `i` and is appended to `res`. After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` is '1919' and is appended to `res`.***
