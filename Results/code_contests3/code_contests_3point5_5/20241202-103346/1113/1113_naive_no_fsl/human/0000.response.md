Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, which does not guarantee that the resulting sudoku puzzle will be an anti-sudoku. The program does not change at most 9 elements in the sudoku puzzle to create an anti-sudoku.

Additionally, the program does not handle the 9 test cases correctly as it only reads the input for one test case. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
