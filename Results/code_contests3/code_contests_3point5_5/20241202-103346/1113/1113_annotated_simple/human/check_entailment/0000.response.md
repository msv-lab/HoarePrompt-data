Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and then outputs the modified rows. This transformation ensures that each row, column, and 3x3 block has at least two equal elements, making the sudoku solution an anti-sudoku. The program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for each test case.
