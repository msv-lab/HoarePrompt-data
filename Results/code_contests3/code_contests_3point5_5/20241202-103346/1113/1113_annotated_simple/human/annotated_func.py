    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop execution, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` is an empty string, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the empty `row`, `i` is the last character of `row` before it became empty, and the loop does not execute.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not have explicit parameters as they are handled internally. It reads input test cases, replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the modified rows. The function is designed to handle a specific input format of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters from 1 to 9. It does not return any value but prints the modified rows.
