Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is either '1' or a concatenation of '1' and increasing numbers starting from 1 depending on the condition, `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is a concatenation of '1' and increasing numbers starting from 1.***
