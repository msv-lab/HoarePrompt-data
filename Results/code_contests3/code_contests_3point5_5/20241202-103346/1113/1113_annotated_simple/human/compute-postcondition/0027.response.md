According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be 9.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is the original input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is 9**
