Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the new value of `nRow` will depend on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing updated `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character with the next character being processed for the next iteration.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing updated `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character with the next character being processed for the next iteration**
