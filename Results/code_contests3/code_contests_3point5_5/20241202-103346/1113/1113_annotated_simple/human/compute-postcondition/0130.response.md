Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing at least one '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute for the first time. In addition, when the condition `(i == '9')` is true, indicating `i` is equal to '9'.***
