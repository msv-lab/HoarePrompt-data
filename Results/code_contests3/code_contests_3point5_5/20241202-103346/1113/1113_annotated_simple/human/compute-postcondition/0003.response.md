Example Answer:
The `write` variable is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`. This means that the `write` variable now references the `write` method of `sys.stdout`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, a lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit.
Output State: **Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, a lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit**.
