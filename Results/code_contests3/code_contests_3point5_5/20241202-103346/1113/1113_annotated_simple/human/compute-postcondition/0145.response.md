According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the length of `row`, and `nRow` contains the string with all '9's replaced by '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be less than 9, and since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, `i` should be 9 for the loop to execute again.
