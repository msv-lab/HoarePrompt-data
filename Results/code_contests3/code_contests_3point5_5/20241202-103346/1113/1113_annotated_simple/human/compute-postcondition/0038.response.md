Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is the next character in `row`. If the next character of `row` is '9', `nRow` is the original `nRow` string concatenated with '1'. If the next character of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by appending the next character in `row` to its existing value. After the execution of the code snippet, `nRow` will be updated based on the next character `i` in `row`.**
