Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing at least one '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 1, `nRow` has '1' appended to it, and `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'. If `i` is '9', no concatenation occurs.***
