Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is a string containing the value of `i` concatenated in each iteration.***
