Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character. If the next character of `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to the end. If the next character of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by appending the next character in `row` to its existing value. `i` is the next character in `row`.***
