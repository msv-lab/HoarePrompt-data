Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is the first character in `row`. If the first character of `row` is '9', `nRow` is the original `nRow` string concatenated with '1'. If the first character of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its existing value.***
