Example Answer:
The string `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the index of the last character in `row` + 2.
