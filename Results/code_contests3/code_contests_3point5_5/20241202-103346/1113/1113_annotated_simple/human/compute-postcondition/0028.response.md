Example Answer: 
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The value of `row` is directly dependent on the user input, so it can vary. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is the user input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is 9.
