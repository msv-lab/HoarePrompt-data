Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, and `i` is increased by 1. The value of `nRow` can be '1' or a concatenation of '1' and the increasing numbers starting from 1 based on the previous value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is either '1' or a concatenation of '1' and increasing numbers starting from 1, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is either '1' or a concatenation of '1' and increasing numbers starting from 1, `i` is increased by 1**
