Example Answer:
The value of `i` is concatenated to the `nRow` string. Since `i` is 2 and not equal to '9', it will be concatenated to `nRow`. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will have '2' appended to it. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing at least one '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 2, `nRow` has '1' appended to it, and `nRow` is concatenated with '2'**
