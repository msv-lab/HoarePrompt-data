Example Answer: 
The variable `row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Since we do not have the specific input value, we cannot determine the exact content of `row` or the resulting `nRow` after replacements. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final `nRow` after all replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is the original input string, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is 9, and the updated `nRow` string is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final `nRow` after all replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is the original input string, `nRow` is a string where each occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged, `i` is 9, and the updated `nRow` string is appended to `res`**
