Example Answer:
The code registers a lambda function to be executed at exit. This lambda function writes the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output, which has been redirected to a `BytesIO` object. The previous values of the affected variables are not relevant in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: Standard output is redirected to a BytesIO object and the lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit.
Output State: **Standard output is redirected to a BytesIO object and the lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit**
