Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The other variables remain the same as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements where '1' is added if `i == '9'`, otherwise `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration incremented by 1.
