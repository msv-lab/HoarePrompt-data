Example Answer:
The `row` variable is assigned the input string after stripping whitespace. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is 9.
