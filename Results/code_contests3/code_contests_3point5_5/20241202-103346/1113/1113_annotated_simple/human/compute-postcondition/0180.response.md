Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains the final `nRow` string, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` still has characters left, `nRow` is updated based on the next character `i`, `i` is the next character of `row` and is less than 9. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
