The string `nRow` is appended with the character '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is a non-empty string with characters left, so after execution, `nRow` will have the additional character '1'. The states of the other variables remain the same. 

Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string with characters left, `nRow` is appended with the character '1'**
