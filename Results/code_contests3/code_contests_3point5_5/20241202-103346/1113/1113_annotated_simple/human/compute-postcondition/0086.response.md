According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 9 times. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration is incremented by 1**
