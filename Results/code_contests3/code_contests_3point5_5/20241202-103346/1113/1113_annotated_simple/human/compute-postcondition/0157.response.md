Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` is the updated input string after removing the first character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the updated `row`, `i` is the first character of the updated `row` if it is not empty. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is appended with `i`.***
