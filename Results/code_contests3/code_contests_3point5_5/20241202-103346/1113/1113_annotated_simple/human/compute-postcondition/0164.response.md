According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains the final `nRow` string, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` is an empty string, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the empty `row`, `i` is the last character of `row` before it became empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 9 and the next value of `i` should be updated.
