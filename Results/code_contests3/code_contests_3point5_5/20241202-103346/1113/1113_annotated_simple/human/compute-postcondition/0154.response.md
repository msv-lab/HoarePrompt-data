According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- Update `row` to remove the first character that was processed in the previous iteration.
- If the updated `row` is not empty, update `i` to be the first character of the updated `row`.

State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` is the updated input string after removing the first character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the updated `row`, `i` is the first character of the updated `row` if it is not empty.**
