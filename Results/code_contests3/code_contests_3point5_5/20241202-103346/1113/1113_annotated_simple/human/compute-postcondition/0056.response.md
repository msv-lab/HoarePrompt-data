Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its existing value. As a result, the new value of `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final `nRow` after all replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` still has characters left, `i` is either '9' or 0, the updated `nRow` string is appended to `res`, and `nRow` is updated with '1'.
