Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string with characters left, and `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string with characters left, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`**
