Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final `nRow` after all replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` still has characters left, `i` is either '9' or 0, the updated `nRow` string is appended to `res`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated with '1'. If `i` is 0, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.***
