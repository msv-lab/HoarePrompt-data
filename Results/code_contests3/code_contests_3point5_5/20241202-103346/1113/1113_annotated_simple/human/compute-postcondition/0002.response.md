Example Answer:
The `input` function is reassigned to read from a `BytesIO` object that redirects standard output. Additionally, a lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and a lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit.
Output State: **Standard output is redirected to a `BytesIO` object, and a lambda function is registered to write the value of `sys.stdout` at exit**
