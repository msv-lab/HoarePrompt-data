According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters left in the string `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` needs to be considered. If the next character is '9', `nRow` should be updated by appending '1' to the end. If the next character is not '9', `nRow` should be updated by appending the next character in `row` to its existing value. Therefore, `nRow` should reflect this change.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing updated `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string containing at least one character with the next character being processed for the next iteration**
