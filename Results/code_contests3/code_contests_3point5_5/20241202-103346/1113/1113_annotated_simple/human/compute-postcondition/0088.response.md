Example Answer:
The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration is incremented by 1.
