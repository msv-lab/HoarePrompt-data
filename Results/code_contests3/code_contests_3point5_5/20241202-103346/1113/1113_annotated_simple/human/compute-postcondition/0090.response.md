Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `row` contains characters to iterate over. The value of `i` is equal to '9'.***
