Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` could be either '1' or the value of `i` depending on the condition, `i` is the index of the last character in `row` + 2. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is the value of `i`.***
