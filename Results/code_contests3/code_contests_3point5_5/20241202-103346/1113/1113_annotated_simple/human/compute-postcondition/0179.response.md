Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the next character `i`. The character `i` is less than 9, and `nRow` already contains the final string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be updated based on the next character `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains the final `nRow` string, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1, `row` still has characters left, `nRow` is updated based on the next character `i`, `i` is the next character of `row` and is less than 9**
