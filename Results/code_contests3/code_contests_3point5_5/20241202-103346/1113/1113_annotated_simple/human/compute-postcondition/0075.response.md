Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` is a list containing all the final `nRow` strings after replacing '9's with '1's in each input row, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is less than `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the character in the input string which is being processed in this iteration. If `i` is equal to '9', then the character '9' in the current input row is replaced with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', no replacement occurs and the program continues processing the input string.***
