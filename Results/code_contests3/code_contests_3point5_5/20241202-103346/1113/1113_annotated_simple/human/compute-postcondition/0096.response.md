Example Answer:
`nRow` has '1' appended to it. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have '1' added to it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements with '1' added, `i` is the next character to be processed in the next iteration.
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements with '1' added, `i` is the next character to be processed in the next iteration**
