Functionality: ** The function does not have explicit parameters as they are handled internally. It reads input test cases, replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the modified rows. The function is designed to handle a specific input format of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters from 1 to 9. It does not return any value but prints the modified rows. **
