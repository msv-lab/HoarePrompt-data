According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string does not determine whether the loop will execute or not. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must be a non-empty string.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time**
