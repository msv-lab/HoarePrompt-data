Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final `nRow` after all replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` still has characters left, `i` is either '9' or 0, the updated `nRow` string is appended to `res` for the loop to execute another time. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` contains the concatenated values of its previous state and the current value of `i`.***
