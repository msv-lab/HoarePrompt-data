Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string with characters left. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is the original `row` string with '1' appended at the end. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is the concatenation of the string `row` and the integer `i`.***
