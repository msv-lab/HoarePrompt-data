According to the code, the loop will execute T times, where T is the input integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, T must be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, and `T` is the input integer. To ensure the loop executes, `T` needs to be a positive integer greater than 0, and `t` should start at 0 since it is the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
