Example Answer:
The string `nRow` containing the final modified string is appended to the list `res`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration.
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements, `i` is the last character processed in the final iteration**
