Example Answer:
The code appends the string '1' to the `nRow` variable. Before the execution, `nRow` is an empty string. After execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the index of the last character in `row` + 2, and the value of `i` is equal to '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow`, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the index of the last character in `row` + 2, and the value of `i` is equal to '9'**
