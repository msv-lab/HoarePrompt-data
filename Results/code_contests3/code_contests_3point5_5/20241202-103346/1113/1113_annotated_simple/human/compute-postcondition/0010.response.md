Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string.
