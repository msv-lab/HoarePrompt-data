Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements with '1' added if `i == '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements and appended with the next character `i`, `i` is the next character to be processed in the next iteration in both cases***
