Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains all the final `nRow` strings after replacements with the appended `nRow` for each iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespace and has at least one character, `nRow` is the string obtained by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`. If the first character of `row` is '9', then '1' is appended at the end of `nRow`. If the first character of `row` is not '9', then the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
