Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` is a list containing all the final `nRow` strings after replacing '9's with '1's, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is less than `T`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the final modified string after all replacements. If `i` is equal to '9', an additional '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`.***
