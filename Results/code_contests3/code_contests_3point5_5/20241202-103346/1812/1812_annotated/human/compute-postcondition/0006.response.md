Example Answer:
N is updated by subtracting the value of M. Since N is derived from the string representation of s excluding the last character, and M is either 1 or 2, the possible values for N are either N - 1 or N - 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is either N - 1 or N - 2, C is calculated as described above, M is 2.
