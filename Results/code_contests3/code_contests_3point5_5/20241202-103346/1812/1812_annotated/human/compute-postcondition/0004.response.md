Example Answer:
M is assigned the value of N - 1 modulo 3. N is extracted from the string representation of s excluding the last character, so if s is 'b3', N would be 3. Therefore, M = 3 - 1 % 3 = 2. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is an integer extracted from the string representation of s excluding the last character, C is calculated as described above, M is 2.**
