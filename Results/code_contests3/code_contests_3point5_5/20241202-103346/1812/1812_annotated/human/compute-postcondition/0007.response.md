Example Answer:
The value of M is XORed with 3. Since M is 2, XORing it with 3 results in 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is either N - 1 or N - 2, C is calculated as described above, M is 1.
