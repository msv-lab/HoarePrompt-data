N is assigned the value N + M. The value of N can be N - 1 or N - 2, and M is 1. Therefore, after execution, N becomes either N or N - 1. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is either N or N - 1, C is calculated as described above, M is 1**
