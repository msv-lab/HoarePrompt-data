Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline()` and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, and s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, and s is a character representing Vasya's seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
