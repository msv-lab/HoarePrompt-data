Postcondition: ***`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character and then subtracting either 1 or 2 and adding either 2 or 1, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is either 2 or 1. If M is 1 or 2, the program executes the if part.***
