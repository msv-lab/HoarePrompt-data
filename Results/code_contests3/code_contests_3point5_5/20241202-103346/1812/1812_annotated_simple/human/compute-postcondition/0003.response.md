Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the last character of `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The value of `S` is obtained from `gets()`, and `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a'.
Output State: **`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a'**
