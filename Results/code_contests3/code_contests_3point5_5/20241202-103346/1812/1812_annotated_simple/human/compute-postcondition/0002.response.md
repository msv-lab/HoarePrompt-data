Example Answer: 
`N` is assigned the integer value obtained by converting the input string `S` after removing the last character. The value of `S` is obtained from `gets()`. The final value of `N` depends on the value of `S`, so it could vary. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character.
Output State: **`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character**
