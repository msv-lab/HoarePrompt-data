Example Answer:
`M` is XORed with 3. Since the possible values of `M` are 1 or 2, when XORed with 3, the new value of `M` can be either 2 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character and then subtracting either 1 or 2, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is either 2 or 1.
Output State: **`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character and then subtracting either 1 or 2, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is either 2 or 1**
