Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `N - 1 & 3`, where `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character, and `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a'. The previous values of `N` and `C` are dependent on the input string `S`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is the result of `N - 1 & 3`.
Output State: **`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is the result of `N - 1 & 3`**
