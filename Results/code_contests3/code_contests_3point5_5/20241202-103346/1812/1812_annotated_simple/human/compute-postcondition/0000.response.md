Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to strip the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The `sys` module needs to be imported for this code to work. The initial state does not mention any other variables, so the output state is: The input consists of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').
Output State: **The input consists of Vasya's seat in the format ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
