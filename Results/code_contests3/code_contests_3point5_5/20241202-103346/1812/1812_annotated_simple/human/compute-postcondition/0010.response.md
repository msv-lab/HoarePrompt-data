Example Answer:
The formula calculates the result based on the values of `N` and `C`. `N` is derived from the input string `S`, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', and `M` is either 1 or 2. In this case, we do not have the initial values of `S`, `N`, `C`, or `M`, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: *`S` is the input string obtained from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value derived from `S` after removing the last character and then subtracting either 1 or 2 and adding either 2 or 1, `C` is the ASCII value difference of the last character of `S` and 'a', `M` is either 2 or 1. If M is 1 or 2, the program executes the if part.
