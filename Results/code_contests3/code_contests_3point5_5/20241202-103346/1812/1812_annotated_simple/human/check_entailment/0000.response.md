Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by first parsing the input to extract the row number and seat letter. Then, it calculates the time it takes for Vasya to get his lunch based on the row number and seat letter. The calculations consider the movement pattern of the flight attendants and the order in which passengers are served based on their seat positions. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output.
