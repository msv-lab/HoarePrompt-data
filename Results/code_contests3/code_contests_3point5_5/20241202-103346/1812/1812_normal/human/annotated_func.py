#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and s is a character representing a seat ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
def func():
    gets = lambda r=sys.stdin.readline: r().strip()
    S = gets()
    N = int(S[:-1])
    C = ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')
    M = N - 1 & 3
    if (M in (1, 2)) :
        N -= M
        M ^= 3
        N += M
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *Output State: Error: undefined variable `S`, missing `sys` module, undefined variable `r`. `M` is either 1 or 2 has been XORed with 3. `N` is either 4 or 5.
    print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user, calculates a seat number for a passenger on an airplane, and prints the result. It does not accept any parameters. The seat number calculation involves converting a string input into an integer `N`, determining a seat letter `C`, and performing bitwise operations on `M`. The final seat number is computed using a formula and printed. However, the annotations mention some undefined variables and missing modules, which can lead to errors.
