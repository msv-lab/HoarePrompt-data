According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. So for the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be a non-zero positive integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
