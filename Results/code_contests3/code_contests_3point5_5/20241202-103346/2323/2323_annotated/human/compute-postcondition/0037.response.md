Example Answer:
`a` is updated to be the floor division of `a` by 10. The value of `h` (remainder of `a` divided by 10) will also change accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `h` are updated integers, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain integers.
Output State: **`a`, `h` are updated integers, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain integers**
