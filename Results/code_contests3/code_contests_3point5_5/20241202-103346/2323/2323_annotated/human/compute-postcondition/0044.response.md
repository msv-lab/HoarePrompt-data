Output State: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are integers. The loop will execute `c` times in total. After the loop finishes, `a` will be 0, `copya` will be the original value of `a`, `ans` will be the minimum remainder of `a` divided by `b` for all iterations, `h` will be the last digit of the original `a`.
