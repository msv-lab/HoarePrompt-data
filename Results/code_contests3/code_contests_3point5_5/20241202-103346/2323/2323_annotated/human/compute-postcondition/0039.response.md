The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current value of `ans` and the result of `a % b`, where `a` is 305. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `i`, and `h` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 305, `h` is updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` is updated, `i` remain integer.
Output State: **`a` is 305, `h` is updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` is updated, `i` remain integer**
