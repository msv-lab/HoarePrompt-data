Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, where `%` is the modulus operator which returns the remainder of the division of `a` by 10. The previous values of the variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: `a` is updated based on the condition, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `copya` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is calculated as the remainder of `a` divided by 10.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on the condition, `b` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `copya` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is calculated as the remainder of `a` divided by 10**
