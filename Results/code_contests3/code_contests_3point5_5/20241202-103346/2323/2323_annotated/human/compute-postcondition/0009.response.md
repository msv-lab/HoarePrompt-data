Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10.
