Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. If `a` % 10 != 0, `a` is updated based on a certain condition, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `h` is the remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10. If `a` % 10 == 0, `a` is updated based on a different condition, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the updated value of `a % 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `c`.***
