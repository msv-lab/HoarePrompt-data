Example Answer:
The loop iterates `c` times and calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b` for each iteration. After the loop finishes, `a` becomes 0, `copya` retains the original value of `a`, `ans` holds the minimum remainder obtained during the iterations, and `h` stores the last digit of the original `a`. Finally, `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`a` is 0, `copya` is the original value of `a`, `ans` holds the minimum remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`.**
