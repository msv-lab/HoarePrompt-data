Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. If `a`'s last digit is not 0, then `a` is updated to the result of integer division of the original `a` by 10 and `h` is the last digit of the original `a`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the result of integer division of the original `a` by 10 and `h` is the remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10.***
