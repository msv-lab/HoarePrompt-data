Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10.
