According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be non-zero, which means the value of `a` after division by 10 should not be zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again `a` after division by 10 is a non-zero value**
