Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `c` is 2. After execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10 and `copya` should not be equal to 0.
