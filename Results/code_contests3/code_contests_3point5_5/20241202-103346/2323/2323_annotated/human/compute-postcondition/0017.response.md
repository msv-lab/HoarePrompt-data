Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` which is found by taking the remainder of `a` divided by 10. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will be a non-zero digit. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
