Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are integers. If `a` % 10 != 0, `a` is updated based on the condition, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `i` remain the same, `ans` is updated as the minimum of its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is calculated as the remainder of `a` divided by 10. If `a` % 10 == 0, `a` is updated based on the condition, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the updated value of `a % 10`.***
