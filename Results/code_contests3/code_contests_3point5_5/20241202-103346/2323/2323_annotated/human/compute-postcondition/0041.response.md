Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to the floor division of `a` by 10. `h` is calculated as the remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are integers, `h` is the remainder of the updated `a` divided by 10**
