According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` should not be equal to 0 after the floor division by 10.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10 and `copya` should not be equal to 0**.
