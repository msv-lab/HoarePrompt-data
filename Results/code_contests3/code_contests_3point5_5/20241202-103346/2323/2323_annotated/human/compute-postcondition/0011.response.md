Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by floor division by 10. The previous value of `copya` is unknown but it should not be equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros, the number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is a non-zero positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again, `copya` is updated by floor division by 10 and `copya` should not be equal to 0.
