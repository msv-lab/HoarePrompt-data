Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The previous values of `a`, `h`, and `c` are known. Let's assume `c` is 2, `h` is 3, and `a` is 5. Therefore, after execution, `a` will be `10 ** 2 * 3 + 5 = 305`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 305, `h` is updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain integers.
Output State: **`a` is 305, `h` is updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain integers**
