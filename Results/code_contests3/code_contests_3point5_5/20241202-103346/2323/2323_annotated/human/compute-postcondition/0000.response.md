Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros and the number `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. 
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer without leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `a` is an input integer.**
