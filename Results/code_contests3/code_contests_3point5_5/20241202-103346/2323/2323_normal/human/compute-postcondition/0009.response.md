Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `c` is 1. After execution, `c` becomes 2. The values of `a` and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is 0, `c` is 2 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is 0, `c` is 2 for the loop to execute again**
