Output State: **'a', 'copya', 'c' are decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after division by 10, 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 != 0, 'c' is one less than the initial value, 'h' is the last digit of the updated 'a', 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 == 0, for the loop to execute a second time 'c' must be greater than 0. 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'.**
