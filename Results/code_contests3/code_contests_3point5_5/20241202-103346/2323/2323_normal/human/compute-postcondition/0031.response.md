Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` which is obtained by taking the modulo 10 of `a`. The value of `a` is decremented by 1, so the last digit of `a` changes accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans'.
Output State: **'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans'**
