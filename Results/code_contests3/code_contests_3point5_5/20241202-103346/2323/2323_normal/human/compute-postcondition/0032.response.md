Example Answer:
The value of 'a' is integer divided by 10. Since 'a' was decremented by 1, the new value of 'a' will be the integer value of the previous 'a' divided by 10. 'copya', 'c', 'i', 'h', and 'ans' are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after the division, 'ans'.
Output State: **'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after the division, 'ans'**
