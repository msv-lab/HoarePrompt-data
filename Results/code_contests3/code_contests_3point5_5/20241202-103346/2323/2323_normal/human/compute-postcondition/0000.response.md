Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` will be the input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: The input consists of two positive integers, where the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros. The second integer m is between 2 and 10^8, inclusive. `a` is the value provided by the user.
