Example Answer: 
'a' is updated to be 10 raised to the power of 'c' multiplied by 'h' and added to the original value of 'a'. 'a' is divided by 10 initially, so the new value of 'a' is calculated accordingly. 'copya' retains the original value of 'a'. 'c' remains the same as the number of digits in the original value of 'a' minus 1. 'i' remains 0, and 'h' is updated to be the last digit of the new value of 'a'. 
Output State: **'a' is the updated value, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a' minus 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a'**
