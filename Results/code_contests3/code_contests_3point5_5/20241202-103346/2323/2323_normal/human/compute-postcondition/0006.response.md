Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is unknown, so after execution, `c` will be 1. The value of `a` is provided by the user, and `copya` is the integer division of `copya` by 10, but the initial value of `copya` is not provided, so it cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the integer division of `copya` by 10, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the integer division of `copya` by 10, `c` is 1**
