According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the integer division of `copya` by 10, and `c` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted such that it is not equal to 0. 
State: **`a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is not equal to 0, `c` is 1 for the loop to execute again**
