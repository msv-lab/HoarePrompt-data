Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The value of `b` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a' is the value provided by the user, 'copya' is 0, 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a'.
Output State: **'a' is the value provided by the user, 'copya' is 0, 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a'**
