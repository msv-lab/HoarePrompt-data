Postcondition: ***'a', 'copya', 'c', 'i', 'h', 'ans' are integers. If 'a' % 10 != 0, then 'a' is updated, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is decreased by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans' is the minimum value between 'ans' and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 == 0, then 'a' is updated with a new value, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a'.***
