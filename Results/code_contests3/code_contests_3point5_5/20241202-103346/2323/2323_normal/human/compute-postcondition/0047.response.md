Functionality: The function `func` takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's very big positive integer and the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, and the second integer is between 2 and 10^8. The function calculates the minimum remainder when dividing modified versions of the input integer by the divisor. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated minimum remainder.
