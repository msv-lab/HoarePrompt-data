According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is considered True. Right before the loop, `a` is the value provided by the user and `copya` is the same value as `a`. In order for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `a` provided by the user should evaluate to True. Therefore, the value of `a` must not be 0 or an empty string, as those would evaluate to False in a boolean context.
State: **`a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the same value as `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should evaluate to True (not 0 or an empty string)**
