Example Answer:
The last digit of 'a' is extracted and stored in 'h' by performing the modulo operation with 10. Since 'a' is the value provided by the user, the last digit is determined by 'a % 10'. 'copya', 'c', and 'i' remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a' is the value provided by the user, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time 'c' is greater than 0, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a'.
Output State: **'a' is the value provided by the user, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time 'c' is greater than 0, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a'**
