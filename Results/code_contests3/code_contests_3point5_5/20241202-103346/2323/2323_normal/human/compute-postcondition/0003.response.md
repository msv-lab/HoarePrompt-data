Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, where `a` is the value provided by the user. The value of `a` is unchanged, so the output state is: `a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the same value as `a`.
Output State: **`a` is the value provided by the user, `copya` is the same value as `a`**
