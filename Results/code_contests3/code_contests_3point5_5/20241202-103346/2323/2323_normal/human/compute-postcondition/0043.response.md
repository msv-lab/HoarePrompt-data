Postcondition: ***'a', 'copya', 'c' are integers. Initially, 'a', 'copya', 'c' are decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 != 0, 'c' is reduced by 1, 'h' is updated to the last digit of 'a', 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 == 0, 'h' is updated to the last digit of 'a' after division by 10. After the if-else block execution, the values of 'a', 'copya', 'c' are all decremented by 1. 'i' is either 0 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition. 'h' is the last digit of the updated 'a' and 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'.***
