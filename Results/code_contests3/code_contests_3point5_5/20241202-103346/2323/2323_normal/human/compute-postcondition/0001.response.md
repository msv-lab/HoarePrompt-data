Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the integer value received as input from the user. The value of `b` can be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: the input consists of two positive integers, where the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros. The second integer m is between 2 and 10^8, inclusive. `a` is the value provided by the user; `b` is an input integer.
