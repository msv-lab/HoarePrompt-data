Postcondition: ***'a', 'copya', 'c' are decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 != 0, 'c' is one less than the initial value, 'h' is the last digit of the updated 'a', 'ans' is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of 'a' divided by 'b'. If 'a' % 10 == 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after division by 10.***
