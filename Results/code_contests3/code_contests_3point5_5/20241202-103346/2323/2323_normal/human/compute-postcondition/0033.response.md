Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` and `h` have been decremented by 1 and `a` is the previous value of `a`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `a` will be `10` to the power of the decremented value of `c` multiplied by the decremented value of `h` and added to the previous value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the Output State is: 'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after the division, 'ans'.
Output State: **'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a' after the division, 'ans'**
