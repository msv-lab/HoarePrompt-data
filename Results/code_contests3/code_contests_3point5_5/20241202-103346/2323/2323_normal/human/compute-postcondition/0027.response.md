Example Answer:
The value of 'h' is assigned as the last digit of 'a' obtained by taking the modulo 10 of 'a'. The value of 'a' is decremented by 1, so the last digit may change accordingly. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans'.
Output State: **'a', 'copya', 'c' is decremented by 1, 'i' is 0, 'h' is the last digit of 'a', 'ans'**
