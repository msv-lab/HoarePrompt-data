According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of 'c'. If 'c' is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, 'a' is the value provided by the user and 'copya' is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, 'c' must be greater than 0, 'i' is 0, and the original value of 'a' is stored in 'copya'.
State: **'a' is the value provided by the user, 'copya' is the original value of 'a', 'c' is the number of digits in the original value of 'a', for the loop to execute the first time 'c' is greater than 0, 'i' is 0**
