#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two positive integers, where the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros. The second integer m is between 2 and 10^8, inclusive.**
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

    copya = a
    while copya:
        copya //= 10

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 'a', 'copya', 'c', 'i', 'h', 'ans', 'b' are integers. The final value of 'a' is the updated value after all iterations of the loop. 'copya' is the original value of 'a'. 'c' is 0. 'i' is the total number of iterations of the loop. 'h' is the last digit of the final value of 'a'. 'ans' is the minimum value between all the remainders of 'a' divided by 'b' throughout the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func` takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's very big positive integer and the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, and the second integer is between 2 and 10^8. The function calculates the minimum remainder when dividing modified versions of the input integer by the divisor. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated minimum remainder.
