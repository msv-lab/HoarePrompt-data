Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number `m` for all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts and updates the minimum remainder accordingly. The logic provided in the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
