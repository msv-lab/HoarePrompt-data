Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the last digit of `a`. Since `a` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, the last digit of `a` will be between 0 and 9. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
