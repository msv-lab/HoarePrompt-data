Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`. This means that `a` is now equal to a new value calculated based on the previous values of `c` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
