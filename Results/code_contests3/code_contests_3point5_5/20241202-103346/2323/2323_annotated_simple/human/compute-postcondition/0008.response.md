Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by integer division of `a` by 10. Since `a` is a positive integer value greater than or equal to 10, `copya` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10**
