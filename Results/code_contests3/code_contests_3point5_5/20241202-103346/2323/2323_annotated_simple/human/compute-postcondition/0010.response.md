According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated value after integer division by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is greater than 0 after performing integer division by 10.
State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
