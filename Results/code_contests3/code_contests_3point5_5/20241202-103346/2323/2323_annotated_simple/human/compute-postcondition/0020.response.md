Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the updated minimum value, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the updated minimum value, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
