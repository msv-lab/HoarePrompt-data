According to the code, the loop can execute for a total of `c` times, where `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
