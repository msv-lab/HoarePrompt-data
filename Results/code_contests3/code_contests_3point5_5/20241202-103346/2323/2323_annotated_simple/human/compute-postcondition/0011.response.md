Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. As `copya` is initially the updated value of `a` after integer division by 10 and for the loop to execute again `copya` should be greater than 0, the loop will continue until `copya` becomes 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
