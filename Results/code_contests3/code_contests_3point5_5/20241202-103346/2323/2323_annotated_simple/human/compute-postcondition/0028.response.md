Example Answer:
`a` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator and updated with the result. Since the initial value of `a` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, `a` will be updated to the integer value obtained after removing the rightmost digit. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
