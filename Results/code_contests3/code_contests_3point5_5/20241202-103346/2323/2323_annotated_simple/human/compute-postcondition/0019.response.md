Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated as `10 ** c * h + a`. This means `a` is now calculated as 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h`, then added to the previous value of `a`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`a` is updated, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
