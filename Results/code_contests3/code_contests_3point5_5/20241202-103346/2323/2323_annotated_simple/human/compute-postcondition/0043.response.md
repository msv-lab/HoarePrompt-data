Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are positive integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is updated based on a certain formula. `ans` is the minimum of the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b` and the current value of `ans`, `i` is set to 2, and `h` is the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 == 0`, then `a` is updated based on a different formula.***
