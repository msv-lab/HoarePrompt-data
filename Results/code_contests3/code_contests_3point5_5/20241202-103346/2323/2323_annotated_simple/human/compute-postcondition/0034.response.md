Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1. If a % 10 != 0, `a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`. If a % 10 == 0, `a` is updated to the new value calculated as 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` added to the initial value of `a`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of the initial value of `a`.***
