Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `h` is 0**
