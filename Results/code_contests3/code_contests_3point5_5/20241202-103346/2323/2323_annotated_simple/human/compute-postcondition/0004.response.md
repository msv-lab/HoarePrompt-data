According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `a` is a positive integer value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `copya` should be a positive integer value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a positive integer value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` is a positive integer value**
