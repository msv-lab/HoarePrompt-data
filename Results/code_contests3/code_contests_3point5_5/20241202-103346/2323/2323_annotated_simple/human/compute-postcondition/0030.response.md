Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `ans` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated to a new value after removing the rightmost digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
