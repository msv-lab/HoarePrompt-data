Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated value after integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
