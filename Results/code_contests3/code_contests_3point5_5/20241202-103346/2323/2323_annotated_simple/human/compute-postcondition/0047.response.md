Functionality: ** The function `func` takes two positive integers as input: the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer, and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The function calculates the number of digits in the initial value of the first integer. Then, it iterates through each digit of the first integer, calculates a new value based on certain conditions, and finds the minimum remainder of the initial value of the first integer divided by the second integer. Finally, it prints the minimum remainder as the output. The function does not specify a return value. Edge cases to consider are: the length of Stepan's integer being between 2 and 200,000 digits, and the second integer being between 2 and 10^8.**
