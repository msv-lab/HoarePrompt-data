Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is `a`, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0. If a % 10 != 0, then `a`, `ans`, and `h` are updated based on certain operations, `i` remains 0. If a % 10 == 0, then `a` is updated by performing floor division with 10, `ans` is recalculated, `i` remains 0, and `h` remains 0.***
