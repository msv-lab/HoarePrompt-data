According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a positive integer value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be a non-zero integer. This means the value of `a` must be 10 or greater. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a` divided by 10 for the loop to execute again**
