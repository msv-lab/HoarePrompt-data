Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` and added to the initial value of `a`. The initial values of `a`, `c`, `h`, and `copya` are retained. The value of `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated based on the formula, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on the formula, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is the initial value of `a`, `ans` is the remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
