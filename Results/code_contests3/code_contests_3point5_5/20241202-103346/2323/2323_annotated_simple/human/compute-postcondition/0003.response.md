Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, where `a` is a positive integer. The value of `b` is an input integer and `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
