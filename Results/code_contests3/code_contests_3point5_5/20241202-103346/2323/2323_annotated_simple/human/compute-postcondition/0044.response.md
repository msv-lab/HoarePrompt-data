Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are positive integers. The final value of `a` will be different based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The final value of `ans` will be the minimum remainder of the initial value of `a` divided by `b` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
