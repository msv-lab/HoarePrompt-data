Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. The value of `a` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, and `b` is an input integer. Therefore, `ans` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer value (greater than or equal to 10), `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the initial value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`**
