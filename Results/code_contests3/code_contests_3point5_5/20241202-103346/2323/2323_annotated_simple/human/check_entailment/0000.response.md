Correctness: **True**

The program takes two integers as input, one representing Stepan's very big positive integer and the other representing the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. It then calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number `m` among all good shifts of the integer.

The program correctly iterates through all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer and calculates the minimum remainder of the division by `m` for all of them. It considers all possible shifts by moving the least significant digit to the most significant position one at a time. It then updates the minimum remainder accordingly.

Finally, the program prints the minimum remainder obtained, which is the correct output as per the problem description. Since the program follows the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
