Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints describe that the code should print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to the current value of `n`. However, the code does not handle the setting of levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The code simply prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers, which does not align with the security requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
