According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer between 1 and 499 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is now 0.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
