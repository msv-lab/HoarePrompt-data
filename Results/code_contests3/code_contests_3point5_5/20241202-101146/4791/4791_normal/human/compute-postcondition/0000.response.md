Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input but does not specify the type. Since the initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, we can assume that `n` will be an integer within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500**
