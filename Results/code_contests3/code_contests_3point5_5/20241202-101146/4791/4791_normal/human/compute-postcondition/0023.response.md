According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` has been decremented by 1 and is not equal to 0, `j` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0 and has been decremented by 2, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is printed**
