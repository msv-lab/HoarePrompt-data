According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0, `j` is n-2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is n-2. So for the loop to be executed one more time `n` must be greater than 2 and the new value of `j` should be n-1.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0, `j` is n-1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is printed**
