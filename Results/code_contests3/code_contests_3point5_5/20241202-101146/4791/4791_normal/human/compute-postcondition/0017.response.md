Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j+1`, where `j` is `n-1`. The binary representation of `j+1` is obtained using the `bin()` function, then reversed using `[::-1]`, and the position of the rightmost set bit is found using the `find('1')` function. Finally, 1 is added to the position to get the correct position. Given that `j` is `n-1`, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` can be determined. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of n is printed**
