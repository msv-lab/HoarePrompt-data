Functionality: **The function reads an input from the user and decrements it to zero. Then, for each iteration, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of numbers from 1 to the current value of `n`. The function operates based on the precondition that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and does not return any value.**
