Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1, then prints the position after reversing the binary string. The value of j is 1, so j+1 is 2, which in binary is 10. The rightmost set bit is at position 1 when counting from the right. Reversing the binary string gives "01", and finding the position of '1' gives 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is 1.
Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is 1**
