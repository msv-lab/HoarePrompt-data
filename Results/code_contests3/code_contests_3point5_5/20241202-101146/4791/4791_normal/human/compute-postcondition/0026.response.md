Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 2 from the right, so the position returned is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0 and has been decremented by 2 with the rightmost set bit at position 2, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0 and has been decremented by 2 with the rightmost set bit at position 2, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2**
