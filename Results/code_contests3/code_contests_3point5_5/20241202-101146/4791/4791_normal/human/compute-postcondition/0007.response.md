According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is 1**
