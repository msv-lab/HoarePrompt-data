According to the code, the `while` loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `n` is considered True. In Python, any non-zero integer value is considered True. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, for the loop to execute the first time N must be greater than 0**
