According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since we are interested in the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1, for the loop to execute one more time, j+1 must have a set bit at a higher position than the current rightmost set bit.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute another time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 must be higher than the current rightmost set bit position**
