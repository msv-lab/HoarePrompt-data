Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0, `j` is n-1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 is n-1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. The value returned is the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1 after reversing it.**
