Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is currently 0, `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is '0b1', and when reversed it is '1b0'. The position of the rightmost set bit (which is 1) is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0 and has been decremented by 2, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is not equal to 0 and has been decremented by 2, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `n` is 1**
