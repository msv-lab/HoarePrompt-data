According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, an error occurred due to an unsupported operand type for `-=` which implies that `n` should be an integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be an integer greater than the current value of `j`.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute again `n` must be an integer greater than `j`**
