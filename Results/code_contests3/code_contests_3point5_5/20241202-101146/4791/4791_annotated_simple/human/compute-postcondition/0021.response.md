According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. However, the error message indicates that there is a mismatch in data types while trying to subtract an integer from a string. To ensure the loop executes smoothly, the data type of the variable `n` needs to be adjusted to an integer type. 
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1**
