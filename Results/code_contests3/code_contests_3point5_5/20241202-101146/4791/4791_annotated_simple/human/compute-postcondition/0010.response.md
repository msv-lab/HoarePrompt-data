According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is considered True. Since the loop will not execute due to an error mentioned in the previous iteration, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', the loop will not execute as the error prevents it from running properly**
