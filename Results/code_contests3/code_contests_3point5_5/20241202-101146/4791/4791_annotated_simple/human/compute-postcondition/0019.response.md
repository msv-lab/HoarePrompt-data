According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` evaluates to True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, an error occurred due to unsupported operand types for the subtraction operation. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be a valid integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute `n` must be a valid integer**
