According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there was an error due to unsupported operand types for subtraction. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be a valid integer that allows the loop to proceed without errors.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute `n` must be a valid integer**
