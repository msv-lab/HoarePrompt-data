According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. However, the error message "unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int'" indicates that there was an issue with the subtraction operation involving a string and an integer. This implies that `n` is not a valid integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be a valid integer that can be used in the range function. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **Error: `n` must be a valid integer for the loop to execute**
