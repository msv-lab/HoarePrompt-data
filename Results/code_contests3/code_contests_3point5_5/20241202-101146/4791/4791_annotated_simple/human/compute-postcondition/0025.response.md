According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, an error occurred due to unsupported operand types, indicating that `n` was not an integer or not greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to an integer greater than or equal to 2.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 2**
