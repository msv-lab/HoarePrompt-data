According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, there was an error due to unsupported operand types. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be an integer greater than the previous `j`.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute again `n` must be an integer greater than the previous `j`**
