According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the error message indicates that there was an unsupported operation involving a string and an integer, which caused the loop to terminate prematurely. To adjust for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 2**
