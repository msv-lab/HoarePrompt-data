According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `n` is truthy (i.e., not an empty string). Right before the loop, `n` is an input string. So for the loop to execute the first time, `n` should not be an empty string.
State: **`n` is an input string, for the loop to execute the first time `n` should not be an empty string**
