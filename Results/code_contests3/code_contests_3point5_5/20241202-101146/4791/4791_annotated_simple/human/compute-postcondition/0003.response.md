According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `n` is an integer. Before the loop starts, the error message indicates that there is a mismatch between a string and an integer in a subtraction operation. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be an integer value. 
State: **Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', for the loop to execute `n` is an integer**
