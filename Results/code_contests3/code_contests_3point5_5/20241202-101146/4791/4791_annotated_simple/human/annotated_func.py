#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Error: unsupported operand type(s) for -=: 'str' and 'int', the loop will not execute as the error prevents it from running properly. 'n' remains as the input string
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input as a string, attempts to decrement it as an integer causing an unsupported operand error, making the loop unable to execute properly. As a result, the intended functionality of the function is not achieved due to the error in the decrement operation.
