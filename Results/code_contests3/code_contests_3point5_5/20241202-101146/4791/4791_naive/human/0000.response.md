Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem. The program is trying to set levels to the passages based on the binary representation of the variable `j`, which does not align with the problem's requirements. The levels are supposed to be positive integers such that the number of times passing through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to the same room. The program's output does not guarantee this condition for all rooms and passages. 

For example, when N=3, the correct output should be:
```
1 1
1
```
But the program outputs:
```
1
1
``` 

This discrepancy indicates that the program is incorrect and does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
