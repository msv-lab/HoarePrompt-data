Example Answer:
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j+1`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 before the calculation. The position starts from 1, not 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to the incremented `j`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to the incremented `j`**
