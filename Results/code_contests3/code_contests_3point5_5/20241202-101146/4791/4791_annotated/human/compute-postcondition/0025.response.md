According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` should be greater than or equal to 2 and `j` should be 2.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 2, and the output value is 1**
