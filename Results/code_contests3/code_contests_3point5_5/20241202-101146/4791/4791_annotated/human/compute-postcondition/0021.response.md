According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` remains an integer between 0 and 498 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 0.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
