Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 1 (from the right), so the output value is 1.
Output State: **`N` remains an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 1, and the output value is 1**
