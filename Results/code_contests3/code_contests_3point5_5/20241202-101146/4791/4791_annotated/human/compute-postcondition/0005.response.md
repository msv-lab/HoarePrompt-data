According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is incremented and for the loop to execute again `n` must still be greater than or equal to the incremented `j`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to the incremented `j`**
