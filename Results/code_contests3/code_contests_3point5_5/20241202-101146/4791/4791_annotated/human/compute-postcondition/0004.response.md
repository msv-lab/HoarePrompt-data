Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, then converted to binary, reversed, and the position of the first '1' is found. The position is then incremented by 1 to get the final result. The value of `j` is unknown in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
