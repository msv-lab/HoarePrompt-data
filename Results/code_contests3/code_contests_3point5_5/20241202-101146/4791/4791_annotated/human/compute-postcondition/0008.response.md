Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 and then converted to binary. The binary representation is reversed, and the position of the first '1' is found. The result is 1 plus the position of the first '1'. The initial value of `N` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to the new value of `j` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than or equal to the new value of `j` for the loop to execute one more time**
