According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased to 2.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute another time**
