According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is true, i.e., non-zero. Right before the loop, `n` is the input value provided by the user. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `n` must be non-zero. 

State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be non-zero**
