According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains an integer between 1 and 499. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 0**
