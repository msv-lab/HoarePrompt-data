Example Answer: 
`n` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `n` must be non-zero for the loop to execute the first time, after decrementing, `n` will still be a non-zero integer between 1 and 499. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 1 and 499.
Output State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499**
