According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` remains an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `j` must be 1.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 0 and 498, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1**
