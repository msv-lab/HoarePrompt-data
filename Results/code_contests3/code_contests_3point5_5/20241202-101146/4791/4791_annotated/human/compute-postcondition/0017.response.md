Example Answer:
The value of `j` is 2, and `j + 1` is 3. Converting 3 to binary gives '11', reversing it gives '11', and finding the position of the first '1' from the reversed string gives 2. Therefore, the Output State is: N remains an integer between 1 and 499, j is 2 for the loop to execute another time, and the output value is 2.
Output State: **N remains an integer between 1 and 499, j is 2 for the loop to execute another time, output value is 2**
