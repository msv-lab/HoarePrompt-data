According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer between 1 and 499 ensures that the loop will execute, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **N is an integer between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
