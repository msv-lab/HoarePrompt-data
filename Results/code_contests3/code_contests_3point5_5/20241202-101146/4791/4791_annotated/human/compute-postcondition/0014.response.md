According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is not equal to 0. In the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1 so `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is not equal to 0**
