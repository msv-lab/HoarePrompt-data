According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the final value of `j`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a truthy value, which means it should not be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute again `n` is not equal to 0**
