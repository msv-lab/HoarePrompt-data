Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` and adds 1 to it. Since `j` is initially 1, `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. The rightmost set bit is at position 1, so the output will be 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`N` remains an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1**
