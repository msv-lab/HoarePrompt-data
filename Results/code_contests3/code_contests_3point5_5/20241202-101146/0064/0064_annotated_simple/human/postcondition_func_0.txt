The function `func` reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of integers in the list, or the average of the integers if the sum is divisible by the number of integers in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
