Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes input as five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the sum of these coins. If the sum is not zero and is divisible by the number of players (5 in this case), it calculates and prints the initial bet amount (sum divided by 5). Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description by determining the initial bet amount based on the final number of coins of each player. It handles the case where the sum is zero and returns -1 as mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
