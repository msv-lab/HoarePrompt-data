Example Answer:
The sum of the integers in list `c` is calculated and assigned to `s`. Since `c` is a list of 5 integers, the sum of these integers will be computed. Therefore, the Output State is: c is a list of 5 integers, s is the sum of these integers.
Output State: **c is a list of 5 integers, s is the sum of these integers**
