Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or if it is not divisible by the length of list `c`. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `s` divided by the length of list `c`. Since the initial state is not provided, we can't determine the exact output state in terms of specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is a list of 5 integers, `s` is the sum of these integers.
Output State: **`c` is a list of 5 integers, `s` is the sum of these integers**
