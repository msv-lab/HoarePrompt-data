Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of mapping the input values to integers. Since the initial states of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers between 0 and 100, the output state is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100**
