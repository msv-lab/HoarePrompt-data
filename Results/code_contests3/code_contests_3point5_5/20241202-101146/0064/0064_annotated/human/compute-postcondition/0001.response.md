Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of the values in the list `c`, which contains `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`. As `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers between 0 and 100, the sum of these integers is between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100, s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 where 0 <= s <= 500.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100, s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 where 0 <= s <= 500**
