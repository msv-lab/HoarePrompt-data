Example Answer: 
The code calculates the average of the integers in c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5. If the sum of these integers is 0 or not divisible by 5 (length of c), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average. Since the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 is within the given range, we can calculate the average. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers within the specified range and the average is printed if conditions are met.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers within the specified range and the average is printed if conditions are met**
