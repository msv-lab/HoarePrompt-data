The function `func` reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers, and then either prints -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of elements in the list, or prints the average of the integers if the sum is not zero and divisible by the number of elements in the list. The function does not have any return value.
