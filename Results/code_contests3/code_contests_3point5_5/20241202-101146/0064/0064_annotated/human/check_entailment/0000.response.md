Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values for the number of coins each player has, calculates the sum of these values, and then checks if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players. If either of these conditions is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average number of coins each player initially bet. This matches the requirements of the problem description, as it determines the initial bet amount or indicates that such an outcome is not possible. The program covers all possible cases as specified in the problem description.
