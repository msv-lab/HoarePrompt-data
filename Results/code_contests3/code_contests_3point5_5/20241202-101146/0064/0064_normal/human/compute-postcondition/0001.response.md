Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the sum of all elements in the list `c`, which includes c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5. Since c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100, the sum of these values will be between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5**
