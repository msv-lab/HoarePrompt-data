Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the values obtained by converting input elements to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100**
