Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or if it is divisible by the length of the list `c`. If either condition is met, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of `s / len(c)`. The initial state includes non-negative integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100, and s is the sum of these integers. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5**
