Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a line of integers separated by spaces, calculates the sum of those integers, and prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible evenly by the number of integers, or the average of the sum if it is divisible evenly by the number of integers. The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code handles the edge cases where the sum of the coins is 0 or not divisible by the number of players, and outputs -1 in such cases. Otherwise, it calculates the average and prints it as the initial bet size. The output hints also agree with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
