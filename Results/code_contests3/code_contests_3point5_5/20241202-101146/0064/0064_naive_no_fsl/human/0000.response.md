Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of players, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no valid initial bet. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs the initial bet amount.

The program follows the problem description accurately by determining the initial bet based on the given number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It covers all potential cases and correctly handles scenarios where there is no valid initial bet possible.
