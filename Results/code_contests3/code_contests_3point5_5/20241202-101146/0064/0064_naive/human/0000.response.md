Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by 5 (number of players). If it is, it outputs the initial bet value which is the sum divided by 5. If the sum is 0 or not divisible by 5, it outputs -1 as expected. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
