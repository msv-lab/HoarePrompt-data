Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved based on the given input. It first calculates the square root of the input and then checks different conditions to determine the minimum perimeter. The logic covers all possible cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. The program handles both edge cases and general cases effectively.
