Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input integer `n`, calculates the square root `x` of `n`, and then determines the minimum perimeter based on the conditions provided in the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for the given number of city blocks as described in the problem statement. 

The program correctly handles the cases where `(x ** 2 == n)` and `(x * (x + 1) > n)` to calculate the minimum perimeter. It also correctly handles the case where `(x * (x + 1) <= n)` to calculate the minimum perimeter.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
