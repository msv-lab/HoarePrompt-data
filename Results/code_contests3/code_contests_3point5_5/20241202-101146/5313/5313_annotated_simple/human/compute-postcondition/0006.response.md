Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Since x is the square root of n and x is not the square root of n, x * (x + 1) is greater than n. Therefore, the value of `answr` is calculated based on x being the square root of n and x not being the square root of n. 
Output State: **`answr` is calculated based on the given conditions.**
