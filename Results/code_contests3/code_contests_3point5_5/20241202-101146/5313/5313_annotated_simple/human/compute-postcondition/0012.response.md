Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints the value of `answr`. The value of `answr` is not specified in the initial state, so it could be any integer value. Since there are no operations or changes to variables in the code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n, `answr` is an integer value**
