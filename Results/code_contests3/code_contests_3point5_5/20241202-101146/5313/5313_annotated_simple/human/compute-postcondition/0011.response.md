Example Answer:
`answr` is converted to an integer value. The value of `answr` is not specified in the initial state, so it could be any real number. After conversion, `answr` will be an integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n, `answr` is an integer value.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n, `answr` is an integer value**
