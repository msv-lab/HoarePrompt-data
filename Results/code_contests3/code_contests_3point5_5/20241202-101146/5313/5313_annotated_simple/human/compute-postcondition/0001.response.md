Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `n` raised to the power of 0.5. Since `n` is an input integer, `x` will be the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n**
