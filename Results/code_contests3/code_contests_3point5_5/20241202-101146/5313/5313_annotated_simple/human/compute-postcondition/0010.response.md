Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the square root of n. If x ** 2 == n, then `answr` is x multiplied by 4. If x ** 2 is not equal to n and x * (x + 1) is greater than n, then `answr` is calculated based on the given conditions. Otherwise, `answr` is the result of 4 * (x + 1)***
