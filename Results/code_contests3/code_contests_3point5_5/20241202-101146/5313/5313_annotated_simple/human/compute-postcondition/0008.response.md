Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1). The value of x is the square root of n and x is not the square root of n. Given that x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, the value of x can be determined. Therefore, the value of answr can be calculated as 4 * (x + 1) where x is the square root of n. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of n and x is not the square root of n, `answr` is the result of 4 * (x + 1)**
