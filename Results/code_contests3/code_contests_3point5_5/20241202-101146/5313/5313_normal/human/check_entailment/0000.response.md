Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. For example, when the input is 22, the expected output is 20, but the code produces an output of 24. This is because the condition `elif x * (x + 1) > n` is incorrect and does not handle the case where the product of the square root and its successor is equal to `n`. The output hints correctly describe the logic of the code, but the code itself does not cover all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.
