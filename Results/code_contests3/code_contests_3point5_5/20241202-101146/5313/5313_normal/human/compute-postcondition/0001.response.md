Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is the input integer. The square root of `n` is calculated and then converted to an integer. The output state is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
