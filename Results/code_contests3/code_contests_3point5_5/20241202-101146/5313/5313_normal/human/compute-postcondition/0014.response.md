Functionality: **The function `func` takes an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the square root of `n`, and based on certain conditions calculates the value of `answr`. If the square of the square root of `n` equals `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times the square root of `n`. If not, it checks if the product of the square root and its successor is greater than `n`, then sets `answr` to (x + x + 1) * 2, otherwise sets `answr` to `4 * (x + 1)`. Finally, it prints the integer value of `answr`. The function does not take any parameters and does not return a value.**
