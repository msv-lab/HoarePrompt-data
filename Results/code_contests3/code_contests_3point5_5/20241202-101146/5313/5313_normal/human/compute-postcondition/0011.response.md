Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated based on the conditions provided. If x^2 is equal to n, then `answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`, otherwise, it is calculated based on the comparison of x * (x + 1) with n. Finally, `answr` is converted to an integer value. Since the initial values of `N` and `n` are not provided, the output state will depend on the values of `N` and `n` that are input during execution.
Output State: **Dependent on the input values of `N` and `n`, and `answr` is converted to an integer**
