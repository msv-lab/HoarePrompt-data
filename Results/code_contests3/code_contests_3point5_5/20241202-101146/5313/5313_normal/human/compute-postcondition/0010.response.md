Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is calculated as 4 times the square root of `n` if x^2 == n. If x^2 != n, then `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2 if x * (x + 1) > n, otherwise `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`***
