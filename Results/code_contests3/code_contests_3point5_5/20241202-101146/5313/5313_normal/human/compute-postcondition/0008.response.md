Example Answer:
The value of `x` is the integer square root of `n` such that `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`. `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`, so `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`**
