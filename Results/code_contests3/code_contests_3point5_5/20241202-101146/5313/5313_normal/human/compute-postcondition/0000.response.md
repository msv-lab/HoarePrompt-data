Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that N is an integer between 1 and 10^6, the value of `n` will be within that range as well. 
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is an input integer**
