Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1). Since x is the square root of n as an integer and x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, we can calculate x based on the given conditions. Once x is determined, we can calculate the value of `answr`. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6;`n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, it holds that x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n; `answr` is the calculated value based on the conditions.**
