Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`, and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`. Therefore, `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. 
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`; `answr` is the result of `(x + x + 1) * 2`**
