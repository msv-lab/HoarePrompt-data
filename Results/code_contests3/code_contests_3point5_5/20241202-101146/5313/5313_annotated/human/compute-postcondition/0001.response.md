Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is the input integer provided by the user. The square root of `n` is calculated and converted to an integer. The value of `n` can be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer**
