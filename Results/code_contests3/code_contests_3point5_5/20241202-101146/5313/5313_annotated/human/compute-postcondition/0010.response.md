Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; n is the input integer provided by the user; x is the square root of n as an integer. If x^2 == n, then answr is 4 times the square root of n. If x^2 != n, the function checks if x * (x + 1) > n. If true, answr is set to (x + x + 1) * 2. If false, answr is calculated based on other conditions.***
