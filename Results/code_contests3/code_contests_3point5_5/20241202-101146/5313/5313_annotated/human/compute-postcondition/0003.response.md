Example Answer:
`x` is the square root of `n`, and `n` is a perfect square, so `x` is an integer. The value of `answr` is calculated as `x * 4`. Therefore, after execution, `answr` is `4 * x`. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer; `answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`.**
