Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is determined by the user input, which is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user**
