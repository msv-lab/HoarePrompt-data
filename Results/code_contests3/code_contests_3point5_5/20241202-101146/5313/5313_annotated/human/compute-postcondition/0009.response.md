Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is the input integer provided by the user; `x` is the square root of `n` as an integer. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then the function sets `answr` as the result of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1) <= n`, the function calculates `answr` based on the given conditions.***
