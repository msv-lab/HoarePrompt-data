The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the square root `x` of `n`, and then determines the value of `answr` based on specific conditions. If `x` squared equals `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times the square root of `n`. If not, it checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`, setting `answr` to `(x + x + 1) * 2` if true, and to `4 * (x + 1)` otherwise. The final value of `answr` is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
