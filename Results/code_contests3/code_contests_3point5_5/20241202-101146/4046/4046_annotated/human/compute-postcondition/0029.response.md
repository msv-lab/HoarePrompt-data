Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The previous value of `ans` is `4444477777`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum between `4444477777` and the value of `tem`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the integer value after joining the elements of list `x`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value after joining the elements of list `x`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
