According to the code, the loop can execute depending on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is a non-negative integer. Since the loop iterates based on the product of '74' with repeat `i`, we need to ensure that the loop executes at least once. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
