Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `tem` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 2, the number of occurrences of '7' in the new string `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
