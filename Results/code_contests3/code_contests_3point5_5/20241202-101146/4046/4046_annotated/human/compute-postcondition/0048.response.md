Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is obtained from joining the elements of list `x`, and it must be greater than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the updated integer value after joining the elements of list `x` for all possible values of `tem`, `i` is the next value that makes the loop condition true, the count of '7' in list x is equal to the count of '4' in list x, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained from joining the elements of list `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the updated integer value after joining the elements of list `x` for all possible values of `tem`, `i` is the next value that makes the loop condition true, the count of '7' in list x is equal to the count of '4' in list x, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained from joining the elements of list `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
