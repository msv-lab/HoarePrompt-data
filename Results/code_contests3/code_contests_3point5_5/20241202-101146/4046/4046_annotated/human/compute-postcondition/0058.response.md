Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the value of `tem`. The value of `tem` is obtained by joining the elements of list `x`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained from joining the elements of list `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained from joining the elements of list `x`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`**
