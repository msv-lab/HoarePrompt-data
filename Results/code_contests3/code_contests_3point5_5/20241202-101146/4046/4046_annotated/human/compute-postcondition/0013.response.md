According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `tem`, and the string `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is 0, the number of occurrences of '7' in x is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The number of occurrences of '7' in the new string `x` should be equal to the number of occurrences of '4'.
- The new integer value of `tem` obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x` should still be greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, the number of occurrences of '7' in the new string `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
