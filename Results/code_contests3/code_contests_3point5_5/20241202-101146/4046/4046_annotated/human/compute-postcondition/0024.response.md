According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`. If `l` is less than 8, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than 10. Since the loop increments by 2, for the loop to execute again `l` should be less than 8.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of `4444477777` and all possible values of `tem` that satisfy the conditions in the loop**
