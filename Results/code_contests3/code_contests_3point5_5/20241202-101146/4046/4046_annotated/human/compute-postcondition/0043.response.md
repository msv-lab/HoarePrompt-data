According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10 and increments by 2 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value that satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the updated integer value after joining the elements of list `x` for all possible values of `tem` that satisfy the conditions in the loop, `i` is the next value that makes the loop condition true**
