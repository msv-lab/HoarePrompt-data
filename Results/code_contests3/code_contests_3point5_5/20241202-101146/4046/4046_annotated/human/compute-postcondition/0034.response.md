Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is the integer value after joining the elements of list `x`, and all the conditions for `tem` are already met in the initial state, `tem` remains the same. Therefore, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `4444477777` and the integer value after joining the elements of list `x`. The count of '7' and '4' in `x` remains the same, so `ans` is updated based on the minimum value criterion. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the updated minimum value based on the conditions, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value after joining the elements of list `x` and meets the conditions.**
