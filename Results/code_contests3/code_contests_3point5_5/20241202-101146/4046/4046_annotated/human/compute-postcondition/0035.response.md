Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the updated minimum value based on the conditions, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value after joining the elements of list `x` and meets the conditions. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program continues with the updated variables as described.***
