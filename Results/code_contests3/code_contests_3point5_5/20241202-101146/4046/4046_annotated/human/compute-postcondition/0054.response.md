Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the updated integer value after joining the elements of list `x` for all possible values of `tem`, `i` is the next value that makes the loop condition true, the count of '7' in list `x` is equal to the count of '4' in list `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. After the execution of the if statement, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
