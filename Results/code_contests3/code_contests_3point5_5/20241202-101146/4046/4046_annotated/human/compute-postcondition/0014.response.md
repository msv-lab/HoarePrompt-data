Example Answer:
The new integer `tem` is assigned the value obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x`. The initial state specifies that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10. Since the variables `l` and `ans` are not affected by this code, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, the number of occurrences of '7' in the new string `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, the number of occurrences of '7' in the new string `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the characters in the new string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
