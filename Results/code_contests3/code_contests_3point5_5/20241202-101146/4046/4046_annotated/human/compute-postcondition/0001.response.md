Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the length of the string form of `n`, which is the number of digits in `n`. `ans` is assigned the value 4444477777. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so the length of its string form can vary. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string form of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
