You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that positive integers are lucky if their decimal representation doesn't contain digits other than 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Lucky number is super lucky if it's decimal representation contains equal amount of digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 7744, 474477 are super lucky and 4, 744, 467 are not.

One day Petya came across a positive integer n. Help him to find the least super lucky number which is not less than n.

Input

The only line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109). This number doesn't have leading zeroes.

Output

Output the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n.

Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

4500


Output

4747


Input

47


Output

47
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    l, ans = len(str(n)), 4444477777
    if (l & 1) :
        l += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1, `ans` is 4444477777. If the length of the string form of `n` is odd, the function retains the values of `n`, `l`, and `ans` without any changes.
    for i in range(l, 10, 2):
        for x in product('74', repeat=i):
            if x.count('7') == x.count('4'):
                tem = int(''.join(x))
                if tem >= n:
                    ans = min(ans, tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, the length of the string form of `n` incremented by 1 is less than 10, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value of either `4444477777` or the updated integer value after joining the elements of list `x` for all possible values of `tem` that satisfy the conditions in the loop, `i` is 10, `x` is a list of '74' combinations with a length of 10, all values of `tem` are compared with `n` and the minimum is stored in `ans`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer n from the user input. It then calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to n that has an equal count of '7's and '4's in its decimal representation. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, instead, it prints the calculated integer.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
