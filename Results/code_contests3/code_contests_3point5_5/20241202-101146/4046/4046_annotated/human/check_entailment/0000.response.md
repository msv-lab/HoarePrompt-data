Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads a positive integer n, calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to n that has an equal count of '7's and '4's in its decimal representation, and prints this calculated integer. The program iterates through possible combinations of '7' and '4' digits and finds the minimum value that satisfies the conditions. The final output is the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n, as required by the problem description.
