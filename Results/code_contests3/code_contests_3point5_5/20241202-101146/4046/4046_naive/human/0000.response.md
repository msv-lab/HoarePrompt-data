Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to the input number 'n'. It iterates through the possible lengths of the super lucky number, generates all possible combinations of '4' and '7' for that length, checks if the counts of '4' and '7' are equal, and then compares the generated number with the input 'n'. If the generated number is greater than or equal to 'n', it updates the answer. Finally, it outputs the minimum super lucky number found. The program covers all potential cases and works as described in the problem statement.
