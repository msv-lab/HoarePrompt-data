Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from the input.
- It calculates a specific integer `ans` based on certain conditions involving the digits '7' and '4'.
- It performs a series of nested loops to find the minimum integer that meets the specified conditions.
- The code ensures that the least super lucky number that is not less than `n` is found and printed.
- The approach used in the code aligns with the problem description of finding the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to `n`.
- The code seems to cover all possible cases and scenarios based on the problem description.
- Given the examples provided in the problem description, the code seems to produce the correct output for those cases as well.
