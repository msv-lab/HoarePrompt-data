Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+2`, `tem` is the integer value of `x` with all characters joined together for the new value of `i`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.**
