According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1))`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `l` remains at least 1
- `ans` should be updated based on the condition given
- `i` should be updated to the next value after the last iteration
- `tem` should be updated based on the condition given

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1)) + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
