According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `tem`, `n`, and the conditions related to the count of '7' and '4' in `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is calculated based on `l`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. For the loop to execute again, `tem` must be greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` must be equal to the count of '4' in `x`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1)) + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, for the loop to execute the third time `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. After the if condition `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string `x`**
