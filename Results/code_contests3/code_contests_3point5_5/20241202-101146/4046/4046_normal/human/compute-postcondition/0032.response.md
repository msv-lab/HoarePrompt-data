According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `l`, `i`, `tem`, and the relation between the counts of '7' and '4' in `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The new value of `i` should be `l+1+2+2` to satisfy the increment in `i`.
- The relationship between the counts of '7' and '4' in the new `x` must be maintained as specified (count of '7' is equal to count of '4' if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
