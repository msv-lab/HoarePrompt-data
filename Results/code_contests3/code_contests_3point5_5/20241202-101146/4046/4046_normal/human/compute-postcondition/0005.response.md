According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `i` needs to be in the range starting from `l` up to 10 with a step size of 2. Since `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` incremented by 1, the loop will execute if `l` is at least 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is 4444477777.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `l`**
