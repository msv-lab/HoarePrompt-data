Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is assigned the value 4444477777. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so the length of its string representation can vary. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
