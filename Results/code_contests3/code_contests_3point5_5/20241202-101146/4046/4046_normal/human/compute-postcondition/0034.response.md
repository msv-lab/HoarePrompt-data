Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned to `ans`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so we can only state that `ans` is updated based on the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`**
