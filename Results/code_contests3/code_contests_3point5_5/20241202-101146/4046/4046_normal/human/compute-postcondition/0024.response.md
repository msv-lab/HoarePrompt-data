According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i < 10` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l+1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 10. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` should be `l+1+2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop**.
