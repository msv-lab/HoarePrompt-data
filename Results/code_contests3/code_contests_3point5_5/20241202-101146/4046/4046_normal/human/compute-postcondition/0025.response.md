According to the code, the loop can execute if the product of the string '74' repeated `i` times is being iterated over. The loop will execute as long as `i` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is a non-negative integer**
