Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l`, `tem` is the integer value of `x` with all characters joined together. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
