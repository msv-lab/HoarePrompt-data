Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1)) + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, for the loop to execute the third time `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. After the if condition `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string `x` if all the conditions are satisfied.***
