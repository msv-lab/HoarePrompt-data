Example Answer:
The code converts the list `x` into a single integer `tem` by joining the elements of `x`. The initial state provides information about the conditions for the loop. Since the conditions are not met in the initial state, the value of `tem` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1)) + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, for the loop to execute the third time `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+(2*(l-1)) + 2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, for the loop to execute the third time `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.**
