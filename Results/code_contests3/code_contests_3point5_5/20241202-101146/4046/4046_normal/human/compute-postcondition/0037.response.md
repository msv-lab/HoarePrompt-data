According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `n`, `l`, `ans`, `tem`, `i`, and the conditions within the loop. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l+1+2+2+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the last `x` that satisfied the condition in the loop, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
