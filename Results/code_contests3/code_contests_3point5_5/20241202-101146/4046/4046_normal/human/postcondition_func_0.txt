Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user's input, calculates a specific integer `ans` based on certain conditions involving the digits '7' and '4', and then prints the calculated `ans`. It performs a series of nested loops to find the minimum integer that meets the specified conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It essentially finds a specific integer based on certain digit constraints and prints it.
