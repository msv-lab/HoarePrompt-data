Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes an input integer n.
2. It initializes a variable ans with a large number and calculates the length of the input integer n.
3. If the length of n is odd, it increments the length by 1.
4. It then iterates over all possible lengths of super lucky numbers starting from the length of n up to 10 (as the maximum length of the super lucky number is 10).
5. For each length, it generates all possible combinations of '4' and '7' using the product function from itertools.
6. It then checks if the generated combination has an equal number of '4's and '7's.
7. If the condition is satisfied and the generated super lucky number is greater than or equal to n, it updates the answer.
8. Finally, it outputs the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n.
9. The logic ensures that the program finds the least super lucky number that is not less than n, as required by the problem description.
10. The program covers all potential cases and correctly implements the logic to find the least super lucky number meeting the criteria.
