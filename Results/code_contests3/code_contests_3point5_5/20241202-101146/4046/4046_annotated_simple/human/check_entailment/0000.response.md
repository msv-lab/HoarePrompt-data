Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a positive integer n as input, finds the length of n, ensures that the length is even, then iterates over all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of that length. It checks if the number has an equal count of '4' and '7', and if the number is greater than or equal to n. Finally, it prints the minimum super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
