The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, calculates a specific value based on `n`, and then iterates over certain combinations to find a minimum value that meets certain conditions. It then prints this minimum value as output. The function does not accept any parameters, and its main functionality revolves around the computation and comparison of values based on the input `n`.
