According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is updated to the next even number greater than the current `l`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next even number greater than the current `l` should be less than 10. 
Therefore, the next even number greater than the current `l` should be updated to a value less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is updated to the next even number greater than the current `l`, it is less than 10 for the loop to execute, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Next even number greater than the current `l` should be less than 10 for the loop to execute one more time.
