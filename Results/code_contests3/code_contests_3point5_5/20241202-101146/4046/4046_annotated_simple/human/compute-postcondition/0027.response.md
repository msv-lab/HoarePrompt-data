Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the value obtained by converting the string `x` to an integer. The value of `x` is not given, so the value of `tem` cannot be calculated accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is updated to the next even number greater than the current `l`, and it is less than 10 for the loop to execute.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is updated to the next even number greater than the current `l`, and it is less than 10 for the loop to execute.**
