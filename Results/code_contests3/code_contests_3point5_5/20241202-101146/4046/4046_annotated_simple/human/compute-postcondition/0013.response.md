According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `tem`. If `i` is less than or equal to `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the initial `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l`, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `l` should be updated to the next even number greater than the updated `l` after the last iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l` for the loop to execute, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**.
