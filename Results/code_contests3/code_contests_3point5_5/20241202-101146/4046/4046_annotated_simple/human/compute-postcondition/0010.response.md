Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` is an integer greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the initial `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l` for the loop to execute, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the initial `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l` for the loop to execute, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
