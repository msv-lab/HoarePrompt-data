According to the code, the loop can execute if the next even number greater than the current `l` is less than 10. Therefore, the next even number greater than the current `l` should be updated to a value less than 10. Since `l` is already the next even number greater than the updated `l`, it needs to be adjusted to a value less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is updated to the next even number greater than the current `l`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
