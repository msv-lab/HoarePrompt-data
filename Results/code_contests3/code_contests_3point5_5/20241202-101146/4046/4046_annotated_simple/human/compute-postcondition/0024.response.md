According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next even number greater than the current `l` and it should be less than 10.**
