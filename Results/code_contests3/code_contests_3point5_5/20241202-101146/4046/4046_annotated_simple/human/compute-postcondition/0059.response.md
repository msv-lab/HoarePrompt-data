Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. After the next iteration, the loop will execute again if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`.***
