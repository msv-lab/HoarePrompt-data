Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and the new value of `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the program updates `ans` to the minimum value between 4444477777 and the new value of `tem`.***
