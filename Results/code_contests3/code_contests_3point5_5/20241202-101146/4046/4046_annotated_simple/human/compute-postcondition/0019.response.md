Example Answer:
The code converts the string `x` into an integer and assigns it to `tem`. The value of `tem` is obtained by joining the characters in `x` and converting them to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables are used to calculate the result.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
