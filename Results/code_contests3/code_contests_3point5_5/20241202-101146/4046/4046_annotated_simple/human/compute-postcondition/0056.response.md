According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `tem` and `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `tem` needs to be greater than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the last updated value of `tem`, `i` is the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. After the next iteration, the loop will execute again if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
