According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is equal to `l` for the loop to execute, the next value of `i` should be the next even number greater than the current `l` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the next even number greater than the updated `l`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is equal to the next even number greater than the current `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer value obtained by converting `x` to an integer, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
