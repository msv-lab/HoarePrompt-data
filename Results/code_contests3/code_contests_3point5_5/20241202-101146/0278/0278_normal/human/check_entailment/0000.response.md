Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input correctly by parsing the integers and floats as required.
- The code then calculates the minimum amount of soup that can be cooked based on the available ingredients and the proportions required.
- It multiplies this minimum amount by the corresponding values in list `a`.
- Finally, it returns the minimum value between the calculated result and `V`, which ensures that the volume of soup cooked does not exceed the capacity of the pan.
- The code handles all the cases specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
