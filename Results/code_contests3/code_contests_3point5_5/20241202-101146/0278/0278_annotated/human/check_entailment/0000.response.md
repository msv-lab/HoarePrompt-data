Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input for the number of ingredients, the volume of the pan, proportions of ingredients, and available amounts of ingredients. It then calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked based on the proportions and available amounts of ingredients, and prints the result. The program follows the requirements specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
