Example Answer:
The lists `a` and `b` are created by converting the input string into a list of floats. The variables `a` and `b` will now hold the values of the input ingredients and available amounts respectively. The initial state variables `n` and `V` remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of ingredients, V is an integer representing the volume of the pan, ai is a list of n integers representing the proportions of ingredients, bi is a list of n integers representing the available amounts of ingredients, a and b are lists of floats created from user input**
