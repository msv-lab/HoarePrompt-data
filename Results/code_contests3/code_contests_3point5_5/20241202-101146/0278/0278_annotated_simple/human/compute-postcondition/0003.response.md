The function `func` accepts no parameters. It operates based on the predefined constraints and relationships of the positive integers n and V, where 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, as well as the positive integers ai and bi, where 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100. The function does not return any specific output value.
