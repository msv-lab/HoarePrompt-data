Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are assigned based on the input received from the user. The input is split, converted to float, and stored in lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `a` and `b` are lists of floats based on user input**
