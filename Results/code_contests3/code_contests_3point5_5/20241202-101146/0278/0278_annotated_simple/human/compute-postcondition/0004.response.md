Functionality: The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b` from the user. It then calculates a value based on the given formula and constraints. The function does not have a specific return value. However, it performs a complex calculation involving the input values and prints the result. It operates within the constraints of the positive integers `n` and `V`, where 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, as well as the positive integers `ai` and `bi`, where 1 <= ai <= 100 and 0 <= bi <= 100. Make sure to note that the function uses reduce and lambda functions to calculate this value based on the given formula.
