Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `V` are within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
