Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the inputs for n, V, ai, and bi as described, calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked based on the given ingredients and proportions, and then outputs the result with the required precision.

The program uses the reduce function along with lambda functions to calculate the minimum volume of soup that can be cooked based on the available ingredients and proportions. It then multiplies this minimum volume by each ai and sums them up to get the final volume of soup that can be cooked. The program ensures that this final volume does not exceed V.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
