Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order. The program then prints the resulting string.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases:
1. For N = 0, the program correctly outputs the original string without any shifts.
2. For N = 2 and S = 'ABCXYZ', the program shifts each character by 2 in alphabetical order as described in the problem statement and outputs 'CDEZAB'.
3. For N = 13 and S = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', the program correctly shifts each character by 13 in alphabetical order and outputs 'NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM'.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the examples, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
