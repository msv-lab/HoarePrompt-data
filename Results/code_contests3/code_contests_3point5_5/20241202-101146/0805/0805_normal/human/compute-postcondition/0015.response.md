Example Answer:
`new_strings` is updated by concatenating `new_s` to it. The loop will execute one more time as `strings` list must have more elements. `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula; loop will execute one more time; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula; loop will execute one more time; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26**
