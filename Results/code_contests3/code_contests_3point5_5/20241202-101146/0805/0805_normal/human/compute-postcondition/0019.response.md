Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + n`. The value of `added_index` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `new_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n**
