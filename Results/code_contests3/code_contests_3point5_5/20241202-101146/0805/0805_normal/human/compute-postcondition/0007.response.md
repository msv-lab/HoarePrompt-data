Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of adding the index of character `s` in the `letters` string with the input integer `n`, and then taking the modulus of 26. The initial values of `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `new_strings`, `s`, `index`, and `added_index` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the `strings` input, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the `strings` input, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
