Example Answer:
`strings` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input. The value of `n` is an input integer, and it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string input**
