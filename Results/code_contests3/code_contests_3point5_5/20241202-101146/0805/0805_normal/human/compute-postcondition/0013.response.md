Example Answer: 
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is unknown, so the output state is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26**
