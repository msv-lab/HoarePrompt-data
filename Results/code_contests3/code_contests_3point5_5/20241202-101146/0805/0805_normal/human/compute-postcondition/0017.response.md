Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the index of character `s` in the list `letters`. The value of `s` is not provided, and the contents of the list `letters` are also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters`.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters`**
