Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are not provided, so the specific value of `added_index` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements**
