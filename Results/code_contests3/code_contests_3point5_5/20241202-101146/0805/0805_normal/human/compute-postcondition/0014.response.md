Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value `letters[new_index]`, where `letters` is a list of characters and `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`. The specific values of `letters` and `new_index` are not provided, so the output state is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26**.
