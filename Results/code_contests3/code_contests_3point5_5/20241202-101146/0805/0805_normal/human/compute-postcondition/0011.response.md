Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the index of character `s` in the `letters` list. The previous values of `index`, `letters`, and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, for the loop to execute one more time, `strings` list must have more elements**
