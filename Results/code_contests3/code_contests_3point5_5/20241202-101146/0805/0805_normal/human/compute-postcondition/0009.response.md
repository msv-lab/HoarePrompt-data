Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the character `new_s` which is calculated based on the provided formula. The variables `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index` are used in the calculation, but their values are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the new state after execution will have `new_strings` containing the updated characters based on the formula.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula**
