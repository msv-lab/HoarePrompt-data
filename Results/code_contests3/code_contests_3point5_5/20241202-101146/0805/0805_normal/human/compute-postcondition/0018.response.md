Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `n` is the input integer. The value of `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters`, so it could be any value. After execution, `added_index` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, strings contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n**
