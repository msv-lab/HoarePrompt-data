Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters`. The loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `strings` contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_s` is assigned the value based on the calculation.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26, `strings` contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time, `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters, `added_index` is the result of `index + n, `new_s` is assigned the value based on the calculation**
