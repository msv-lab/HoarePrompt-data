Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the value of `new_s`. The other variables have been affected by the calculations made earlier. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula, loop will execute one more time; `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26;` `strings` contains more elements for the loop to execute one more time; `index` is the index of character `s` in the list `letters;` `added_index` is the result of `index + n;` `new_s` is assigned the value based on the calculation.
