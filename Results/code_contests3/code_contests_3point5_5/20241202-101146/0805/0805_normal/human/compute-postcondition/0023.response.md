Example Answer:
The print statement will output the value of `new_strings`, which contains the updated characters based on the formula for all elements in `strings`. The variables `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are calculated based on the last character in `strings`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula for all elements in `strings`, `index` is the index of the last character in `strings` in the list `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n` for the last character in `strings`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26` for the last character in `strings`, `new_s` is assigned the value based on the calculation for the last character in `strings`.
Output State: **`new_strings` contains the updated characters based on the formula for all elements in `strings`, `index` is the index of the last character in `strings` in the list `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n` for the last character in `strings`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26` for the last character in `strings`, `new_s` is assigned the value based on the calculation for the last character in `strings`**
