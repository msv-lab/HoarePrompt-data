Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` and a string of uppercase letters. It then shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions to the right in the alphabet (wrapping around if needed) and prints the resulting modified string. The code satisfies all the constraints and requirements mentioned in the problem description. It correctly handles shifting each character by `n` positions in alphabetical order and produces the expected output for all valid inputs. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that it follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the code is correct.
