Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It then shifts each character in the string S by N positions in the alphabetical order, wrapping around if needed. The program correctly follows the problem description as it shifts each character of the string S by the given integer N and outputs the resulting string. The annotations in the code also explain the logic behind each step of the process. The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
