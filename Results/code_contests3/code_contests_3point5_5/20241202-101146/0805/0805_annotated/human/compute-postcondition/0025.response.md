Functionality: **The function func takes an integer input N and a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. It then shifts each letter in the string S by N positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The function outputs the modified string with the shifted letters. The code does not handle edge cases where N is outside the range of 0 to 26 or if the input string is empty.**
