Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as `index + N`, where `N` is between 0 and 26. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character, added_index is assigned the value of index + n, new_index ranges from 0 to 25, new_s is assigned the new character based on the calculated `new_index`.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character, added_index is assigned the value of index + n, new_index ranges from 0 to 25, new_s is assigned the new character based on the calculated `new_index`**
