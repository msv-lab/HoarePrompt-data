Example Answer:
new_index is assigned the value of added_index % 26, where added_index is the sum of index and N. The previous values of index, N, and added_index are known. Therefore, after execution, new_index will be the remainder of (index + N) divided by 26.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is a string containing the character at the new_index position in the letters list, strings has at least 1 more character left, s is the next character in the strings, index is assigned the index of the next character in the letters list, added_index is index + N, new_index is the remainder of added_index divided by 26**.
