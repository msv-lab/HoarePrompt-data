Example Answer: 
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. Since `added_index` is the sum of `index + n`, and `index` can range from 0 to 25 (as there are 26 letters in the English alphabet), `new_index` will be the remainder of the division of `added_index` by 26. Therefore, `new_index` will range from 0 to 25. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character, added_index is assigned the value of index + n, new_index ranges from 0 to 25**.
