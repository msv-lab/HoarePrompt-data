Example Answer:
`new_strings` is updated by adding the new character `new_s` to it. The value of `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `n` is the initial state integer between 0 and 26. `new_index` ranges from 0 to 25. `new_s` is assigned the new character based on the calculated `new_index`. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character, added_index is assigned the value of index + n, new_index ranges from 0 to 25, new_s is assigned the new character based on the calculated new_index**
