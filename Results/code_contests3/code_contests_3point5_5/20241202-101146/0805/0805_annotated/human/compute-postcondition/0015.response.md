Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the character at the `new_index` position in the letters list. The value of `new_index` is calculated using the formula `new_index = (index + N) % 26`. The initial state variables are used to calculate the new character to be added to `new_strings`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character based on the calculations.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string of uppercase English letters, new_strings is updated with the new character**
