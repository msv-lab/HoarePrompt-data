Example Answer:
`new_strings` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables N and S are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `new_strings` is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `new_strings` is an empty string**
