Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer N as input representing the shift value and a string S as input. It then shifts each character of the string by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles shifting the characters and wrapping around if the shift value exceeds 26. The logic of finding the new index, calculating the shift, and updating the new string is implemented correctly. The program covers all uppercase English letters and shifts them accordingly. The program also correctly handles the case when N is 0, which means no shifting is required. Overall, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.
