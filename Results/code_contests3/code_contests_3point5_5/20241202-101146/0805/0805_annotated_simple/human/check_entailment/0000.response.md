Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input `N` and a string input `S`. It then shifts each character of `S` by `N` in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly uses the provided constraints and shifts the characters as described in the problem description. The program correctly handles all uppercase English letters and ensures that if the shift exceeds the alphabet range (26), it wraps around correctly.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for and is correct.
