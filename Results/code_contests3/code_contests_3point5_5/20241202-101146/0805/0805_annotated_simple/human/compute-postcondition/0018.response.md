Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value `index + n`, where `n` is an input integer and `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`. The value of `added_index` is dependent on the inputs provided, so the output state will vary based on the specific values of `n` and `index`.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `n` and `index`, `added_index` is calculated accordingly**
