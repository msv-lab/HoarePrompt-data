Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the character `new_s`, which is calculated based on the index `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `new_index` is calculated by adding `n` to the index of the first character `s` in `letters`. The final output state will depend on the specific input values of `n`, `strings`, and `s`. Other variables are not affected explicitly. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the calculated value between 0 and 25, `new_s` is assigned the value of the letter at index `new_index` in `letters`.**
