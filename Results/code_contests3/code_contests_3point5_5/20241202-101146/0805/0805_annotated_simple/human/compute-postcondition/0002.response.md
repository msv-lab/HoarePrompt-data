Example Answer:
`letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The values of `n` and `strings` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'**
