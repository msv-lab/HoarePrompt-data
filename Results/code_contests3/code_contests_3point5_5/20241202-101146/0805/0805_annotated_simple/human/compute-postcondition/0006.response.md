Example Answer: 
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the first character in `strings` in the `letters` string. Since `index` is determined based on the first character in `strings`, the value of `added_index` will vary depending on the input values of `n` and `strings`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`**
