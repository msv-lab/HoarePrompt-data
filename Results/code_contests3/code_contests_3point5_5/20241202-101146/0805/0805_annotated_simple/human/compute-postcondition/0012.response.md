Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the character `s` in `letters` and `n` is the input integer. The result of `added_index` can vary based on the input values of `n` and `index`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`**
