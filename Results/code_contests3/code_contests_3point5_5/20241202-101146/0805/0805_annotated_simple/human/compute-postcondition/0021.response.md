Example Answer:
The value of `new_strings` is concatenated with the value of `new_s`, so after execution, `new_strings` will have the combined value of the two. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` is updated with the new value.
Output State: **`new_strings` is updated with the new value**
