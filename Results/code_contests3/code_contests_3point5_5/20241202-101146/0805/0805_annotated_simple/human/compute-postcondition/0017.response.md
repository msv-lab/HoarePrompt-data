Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value of the index of character `s` in the string `letters`. The value of `s` can be any character from input, and `letters` is fixed. Therefore, `index` will be the index of `s` in the string `letters`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the updated character corresponding to `new_index` in `letters` for the next character in `strings`**
