Example Answer: 
`strings` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input and assigns it to `strings`. The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string from input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string from input**
