According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `strings` variable. If the string is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `new_strings` is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `strings` is not empty and `s` is the first character in the `strings`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is the first character in `strings`**
