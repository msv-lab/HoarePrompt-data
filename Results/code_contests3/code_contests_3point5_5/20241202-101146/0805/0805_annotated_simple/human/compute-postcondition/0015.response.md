Example Answer:
`new_strings` is updated by adding `new_s` to it. The value of `new_s` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `s`, `letters`, and the calculations involving `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index`. Therefore, after execution, the `new_strings` will contain the updated characters based on the calculations.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the updated character corresponding to `new_index` in `letters`**
