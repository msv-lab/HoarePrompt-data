Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `new_index` is the remainder of `index + n` divided by 26. The values of `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `s`, `index`, `added_index` are given. By calculating the new index, we can determine the new character in `letters`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the updated character corresponding to `new_index` in `letters`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string with the updated characters based on the calculations, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the updated character corresponding to `new_index` in `letters`**
