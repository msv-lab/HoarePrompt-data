Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value at index `new_index` in the `letters` list. The value of `new_index` is unknown, so the specific value of `new_s` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the specific values of `n`, `index`, and the `letters` list.
Output State: **Output state depends on the specific values of `n`, `index`, and the `letters` list**
