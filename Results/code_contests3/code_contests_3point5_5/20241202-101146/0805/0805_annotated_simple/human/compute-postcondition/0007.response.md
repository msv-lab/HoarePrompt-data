Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of the first character in `strings` in the string `letters`, and `n` is an input integer. Therefore, after calculation, `new_index` will be a value between 0 and 25. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string from input, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the calculated value between 0 and 25**
