Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not correctly solve the problem description. The program reads the input values as strings and performs operations on them without converting them to integers. This will lead to incorrect results when trying to find the minimum distance to be traveled. Additionally, the program is missing the necessary import statement for numpy. 

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
4
2 3 7 9

Expected Output:
7

Actual Output:
6

The program does not handle the input values correctly and does not provide the expected output.
