Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the raw input. The number of elements in the list depends on the input provided. Since the initial state does not specify the input values, the output state will be: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a_i are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the raw input.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a_i are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the raw input**
