Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The initial state includes `N` as a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` as integers between 0 and 1000, `a` as a list of integers obtained by splitting the raw input, and `ans` as the calculated absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`. 
Output State: **The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a` is printed.**
