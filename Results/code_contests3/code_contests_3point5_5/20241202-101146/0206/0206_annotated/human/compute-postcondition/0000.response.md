Example Answer:
N is assigned the value of raw_input(), where raw_input() accepts input as a string. The value of N is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a_i are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, a_i are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N**
