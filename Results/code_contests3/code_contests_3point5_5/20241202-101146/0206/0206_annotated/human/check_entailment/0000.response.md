Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program reads the input values and calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`, but it does not find the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description. The program simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not the same as the minimum distance to be traveled.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should calculate the minimum distance to be traveled by sorting the list `a` and finding the absolute difference between adjacent elements.
