Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which does not guarantee the minimum distance traveled by AtCoDeer. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 5 7 8
```
The correct output should be `6` (minimum distance is traveled when starting at house 5 and ending at house 7), but the program will output `6` as well because it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
