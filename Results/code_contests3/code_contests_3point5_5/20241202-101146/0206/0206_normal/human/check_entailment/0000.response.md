Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to find the minimum distance to be traveled when AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions. However, the code provided simply calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list, which does not necessarily give the minimum distance traveled. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The correct output should be 7, as the minimum distance to be traveled is from 2 to 9. However, the code provided will output 7, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
