Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. Since the `raw_input()` function is not valid in Python 3 and beyond, the code snippet will result in a syntax error. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer. Each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000.
Output State: **N is a positive integer. Each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000**.
