Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using the `np.abs` and `np.max` functions. The input values for `a` are integers between 0 and 1000. The maximum and minimum values in this range are 1000 and 0, respectively. Therefore, the absolute difference between them is 1000. 
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, each `a_i` is an integer such that 0 <= `a_i` <= 1000, `a` is a list containing the input values, `ans` is 1000**
