Example Answer:
The input is split and stored as a list in variable `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `N` or the elements of `a`, the output state will be: N is a positive integer, each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000, `a` is a list containing the input values.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i <= 1000, `a` is a list containing the input values**
