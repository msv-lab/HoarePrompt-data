Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description. The program is missing the necessary import statement for numpy, and it is using the `raw_input()` function which is not valid in Python 3. Additionally, the program is calculating the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input list `a`, which is not equivalent to finding the minimum distance to be traveled. 

To correct the program, it should be modified as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def func():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    min_distance = min(a[-1] - a[0], 2 * a[-1] - a[0] - a[-2], 2 * a[1] - a[0] - a[1])
    print(min_distance)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the list `a` and then calculates the minimum distance to be traveled based on the positions of the houses. The minimum distance is calculated considering three possible scenarios: starting from the first house, starting from the second house, and starting from the second to last house. This ensures that the minimum distance to be traveled is calculated correctly for any given input.
