Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The values in `a` are between 0 and 1000 inclusive. After execution, the variable `ans` will contain this absolute difference.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a_i` is an integer for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` contains the input values split, `ans` contains the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`**
