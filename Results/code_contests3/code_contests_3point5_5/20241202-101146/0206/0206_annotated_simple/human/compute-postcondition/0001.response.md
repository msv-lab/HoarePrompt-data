Example Answer:
The input is split based on whitespace and stored in list `a`. The values of `N` and `a_i` remain unchanged. The values in list `a` will depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` contains the input values split.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` contains the input values split**
