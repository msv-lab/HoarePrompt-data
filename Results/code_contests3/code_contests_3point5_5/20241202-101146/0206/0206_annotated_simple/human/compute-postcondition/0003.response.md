Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the input list `a`. The initial state includes `N` as a positive integer, `a_i` as integers within the specified range, and `a` containing the input values split. The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a` is stored in the variable `ans`. Thus, after running the code, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a_i` is an integer for each i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, `a` contains the input values split, `ans` contains the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`**
