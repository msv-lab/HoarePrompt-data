According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `a[j]` is False. The loop increments `j` by `i` each time it runs. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value that satisfies the loop condition.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements corresponding to multiples of 2 (starting from the 2nd element) are set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is the next value that satisfies the loop condition**
