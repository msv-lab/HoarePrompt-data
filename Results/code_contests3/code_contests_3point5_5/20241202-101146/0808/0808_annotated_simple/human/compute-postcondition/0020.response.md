According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999999. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the next value of `i` is 1000000. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements corresponding to multiples of prime numbers (starting from the square of the prime number) are set to False, `i` is 1000000, `j` is the next value that satisfies the loop condition, and all elements in `a` corresponding to multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` are set to False.**
