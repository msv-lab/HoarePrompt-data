Example Answer:
The list `a` is created with 1000000 elements, all set to `True`. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 elements all set to True.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 elements all set to True**
