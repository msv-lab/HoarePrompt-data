Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements corresponding to multiples of prime numbers (starting from the square of the prime number) are set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is the next value that satisfies the loop condition, and all elements in `a` corresponding to multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` are set to False.***
