According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes it 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements corresponding to multiples of 2 (starting from the 2nd element) are set to False, `i` is 3, and `j` is the index being updated in each iteration until it reaches n**
