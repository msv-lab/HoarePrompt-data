Example Answer:
The value of `j` is 2, so `a[2]` is set to False. The rest of the elements in the list `a` remain True. The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches the end of the range (2<n). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with the 2nd element set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented in each iteration until it reaches n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with the 2nd element set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is incremented in each iteration until it reaches n.**
