Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of prime numbers from the square of the prime number to 999,999 set to False, `i` is 1000000, `j` is the next value that satisfies the loop condition within the range `i`, and all elements in `a` corresponding to multiples of prime numbers up to the square root of `n` are set to False.***
