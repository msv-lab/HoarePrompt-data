Correctness: **True**

The program reads an integer `n` and correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark all non-prime numbers as False in a list `a`. Then, it reads integers from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in the sublist of `a` from index 1 to the integer value read from `sys.stdin`, which represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to that integer.

The program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality for all potential cases.
