The function initializes a list of 1000000 elements where all non-prime numbers are set to False using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. Then, it reads input values from sys.stdin, prints the count of True values in a sublist of the list `a` until there are no more values to read. The function does not accept any parameters.
