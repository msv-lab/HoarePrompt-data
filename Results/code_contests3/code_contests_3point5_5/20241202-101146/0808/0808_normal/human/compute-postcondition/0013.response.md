Example Answer:
The code sets the value at index `j` in list `a` to False. Since `j` is not defined in the code snippet, we need to consider the value of `i` which is 3. Therefore, the value at index 3 in list `a` will be set to False. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `3 ≤ i ≤ 1000000` and the value at index 3 in list `a` is False**
