According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000000. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 1000001**.
