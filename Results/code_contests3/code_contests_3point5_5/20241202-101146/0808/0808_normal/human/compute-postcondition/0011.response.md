According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the boolean value at index `i - 1` in the list `a`. If the value is True, the loop continues with the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `a[1]` is True. So for the loop to execute one more time, the boolean value at index `i` (2) needs to be True.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then the program continues with the current state of variables `n`, `a`, and `i**`.
