Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized with 1000000 boolean values all set to `True`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 boolean values all set to True.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 boolean values all set to True**
