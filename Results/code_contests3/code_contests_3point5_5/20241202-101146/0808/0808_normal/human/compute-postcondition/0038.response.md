Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list `a` of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True, excluding indexes that are perfect squares. It then iterates through a range and updates the elements in `a` accordingly. The function reads input from standard input, iterates over the input values, and prints the count of True values in `a` up to the input value. The function does not explicitly return any value and operates within the constraints where `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. The functionality is limited to processing inputs and printing results based on the content of list `a`.**
