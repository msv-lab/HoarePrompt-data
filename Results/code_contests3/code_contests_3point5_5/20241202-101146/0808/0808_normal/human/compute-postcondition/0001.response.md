According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 2 to 999,999. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is now 2. 
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 boolean values all set to True, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the first time**
