According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input provided via `sys.stdin`. Since the loop will execute for the current state of variables `n`, `a`, and `i` only if `a[i - 1]` is True, we need to ensure that `a[i - 1]` is True. In this case, `i` is 1000000, so we need to adjust the state to `a[999999]` is True for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 1000000, `a[999999]` is True for the loop to execute**
