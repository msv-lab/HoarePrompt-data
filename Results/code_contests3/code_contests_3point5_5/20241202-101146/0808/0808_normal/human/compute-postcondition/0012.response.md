Since the loop depends on the variable `i` and the indices `j` in the loop are calculated based on `i`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. 

1. Since `j` is calculated based on `i`, the loop will execute if `i` is within the range of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range of `a`, specifically `3 ≤ i ≤ 1000000`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `3 ≤ i ≤ 1000000`**
