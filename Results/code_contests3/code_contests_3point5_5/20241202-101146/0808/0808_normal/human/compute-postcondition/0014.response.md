According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and the value at index 3 in list `a` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased, and the corresponding index in list `a` should be checked for the condition to continue the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 4, for the loop to execute `4 ≤ i ≤ 1000000` and the value at index 4 in list `a` is False**
