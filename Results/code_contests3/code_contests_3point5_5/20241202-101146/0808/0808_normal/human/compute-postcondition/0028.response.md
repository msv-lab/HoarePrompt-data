Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square; `i` is 1000001. If a[i - 1] is True and n ≥ 1000000, then all elements in list `a` that are multiples of `i` starting from `i` will be modified.***
