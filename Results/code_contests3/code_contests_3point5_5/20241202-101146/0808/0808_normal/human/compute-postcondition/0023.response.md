According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000001 and `j` is 1000002000000 - 1. The loop updates the value at index `j` in list `a` to False. To execute one more time, the loop needs to find the next value of `j` that satisfies the range condition. As `j` is greater than or equal to `i ** 2 - 1`, the next value of `j` should be the next index in the range `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. Therefore, the next value of `j` should be 1000002000001 which is the next multiple of `i` after the current value of `j`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1000000, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with elements set to True where the index is not a perfect square, `i` is 1000001, `j` is 1000002000001**
