According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop executes if the range provided has a valid starting point and ending point. In this case, the loop will execute as long as the starting point `(i ** 2 - 1)` is less than 1000000. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- `n` remains the same as it does not affect the loop execution directly.
- The list `a` needs to have the (i-1)th element as True, which is already the case.
- `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 for the loop to execute the first time.
- `j` needs to be calculated based on the updated value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values all set to True, `i` is 2, `(i-1)`th element of `a` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `(i ** 2 - 1)` and less than 1000000**
