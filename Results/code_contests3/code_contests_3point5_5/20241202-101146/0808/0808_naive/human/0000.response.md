Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly initializes a list `a` with True values for all indices representing prime numbers. It then iterates through the list starting from 2, marking all multiples of each prime number as False. Finally, for each input dataset, it counts the number of True values in the list up to the input value and prints the count, which represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The program handles multiple datasets and performs the prime number count correctly for each input.
