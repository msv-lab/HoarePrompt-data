According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`. Since `i` is 1002, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the array `a` needs to be adjusted to have values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i ** 2 - 1`. 
State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i ** 2 - 1`**.
