According to the code, the loop can execute if the range specified is valid. This means `i ** 2 - 1` should be less than 1000000 and `i` should not be 0. The value of `a` at index `i-1` being true is also a condition for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **`n` is 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is an array, value of `a` at index `i-1` is true, for the loop to execute the first time `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000**
