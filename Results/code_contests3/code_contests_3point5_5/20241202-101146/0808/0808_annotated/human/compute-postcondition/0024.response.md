Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is currently `i`, and `i` is 1002. Therefore, the value at index 1002 in array `a` is set to `False`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is updated to `i`.**
