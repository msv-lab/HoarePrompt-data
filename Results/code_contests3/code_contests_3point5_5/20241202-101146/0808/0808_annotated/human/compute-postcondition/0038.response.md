Functionality: **The function `func` initializes an array `a` of size 1000000 with all values set to True. It then iterates over a range of numbers and marks multiples of prime numbers as False in the array. The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, converts it to an integer, and prints the count of True values in the array up to that integer. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
