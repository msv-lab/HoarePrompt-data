Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value False, where `j` is 1000000. The array `a` now has the value at index 1000000 as False. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is an array with the value at index 1 as False and the value at index 1000000 as False.
Output State: **`n` is 999,999, `i` is 2, `a` is an array with the value at index 1 as False and the value at index 1000000 as False**
