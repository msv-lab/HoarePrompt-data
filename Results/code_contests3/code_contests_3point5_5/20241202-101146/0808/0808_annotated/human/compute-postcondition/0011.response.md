According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified. In this case, the loop is iterating from 2 to 999,999. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 999,999. Therefore, the next iteration should start with `i` as 1001.
State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1001, and `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to 999,999.**
