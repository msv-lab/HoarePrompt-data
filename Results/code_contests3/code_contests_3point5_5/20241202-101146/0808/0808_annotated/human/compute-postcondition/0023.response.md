According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1002. In the for loop statement, `j` is updated based on `i` and starts from `i ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration. Since `j` is updated by `i`, the next value of `j` should be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`. Also, since the loop continues until `j` is less than 1000000, the next value of `j` should not exceed 1000000.
State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, and the array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to `i ** 2 + i - 1` if it does not exceed 1000000**
