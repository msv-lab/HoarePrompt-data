According to the code, the loop can execute as long as i is within the range 2 to 999,999. Before the loop starts, n is an integer within the range 1 to 999,999, so it does not ensure that the loop will execute. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, n should be adjusted to 999,999, and i should be 2.
State: **n is 999,999, i is 2, for the loop to execute the first time**
