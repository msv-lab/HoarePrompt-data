According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the array `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1001 and `j` is 1001. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value after 1001 in the range of `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000. Therefore, `j` should be set to the next value in the range. 
State: **`n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1001, `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to 999,999, `j` is set to the next value after 1001 in the range of `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000**
