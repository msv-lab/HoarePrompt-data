Example Answer:
The value of the array `a` at index `j` is updated to `False`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and the array `a` are not affected by this update. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 999,999, `i` is 3, and `a` has the value at index 7 as False and the value at index 1000000 as False.
Output State: **`n` is 999,999, `i` is 3, `a` has the value at index 7 as False and the value at index 1000000 as False**
