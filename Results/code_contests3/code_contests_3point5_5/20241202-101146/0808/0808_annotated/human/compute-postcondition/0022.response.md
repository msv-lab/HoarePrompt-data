Example Answer:
`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact impact on the array `a`. However, since `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`, we can assume that the non-prime number at index `j` will be set to False. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, and the array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`.
Output State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, and the array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`**
