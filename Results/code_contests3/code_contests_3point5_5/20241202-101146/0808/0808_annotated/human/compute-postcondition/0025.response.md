According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is updated to `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `i` and checked if it is less than 1000000.

State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, array `a` has values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to `i`, and `j` is updated to `i + i` for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1000000**
