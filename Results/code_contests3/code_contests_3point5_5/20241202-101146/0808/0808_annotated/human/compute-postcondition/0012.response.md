According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variables `j`, `i`, and `1000000` have to be adjusted. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
- The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, so `j` should be equal to `i ** 2 - 1`.
- The loop goes up to 1000000, so `1000000` is fine.
- The loop increments by `i`, so `i` should match the current `i`.

State: **`n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1001, `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to 999,999, `j` is set to `i ** 2 - 1` for the loop to execute the first time**
