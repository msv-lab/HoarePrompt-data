According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if the value of `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1001, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to become 1002. Therefore, the following adjustments need to be made for the next iteration:
State: **After the if block executes, `n` remains 999,999, `i` is 1002, and `a` is an array with values set to False at indexes corresponding to non-prime numbers less than or equal to 999,999.**
