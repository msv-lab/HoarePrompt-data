Correctness: **True**

The program initializes an array `a` of size 1000000 with all values set to True. It then iterates over a range of numbers and marks multiples of prime numbers as False in the array. Finally, it reads input from `sys.stdin`, converts it to an integer, and prints the count of True values in the array up to that integer.

This program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input integer `n` for each dataset provided.
