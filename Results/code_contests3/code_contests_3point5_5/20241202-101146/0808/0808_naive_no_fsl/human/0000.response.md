Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly reads an integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers. The program initializes a list of boolean values where True represents a prime number, then iterates through the list to mark non-prime numbers as False. Finally, it counts the number of True values (prime numbers) up to n and prints the result.

The program handles multiple datasets as specified in the problem description and follows the logic of finding prime numbers accurately. Since the program meets all the requirements and there are no potential cases identified where it would fail to produce the correct output, the correctness is deemed to be True.
