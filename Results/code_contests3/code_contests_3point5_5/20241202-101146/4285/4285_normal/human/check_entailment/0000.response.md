Correctness: **False**

The given code does not match the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the n-th even-length palindrome number, but it actually checks if a given input is a palindrome or not by converting it to lowercase and filtering out non-alphabetic characters. This is completely different from the required functionality of generating the n-th even-length palindrome number. The output hints also mention that the code results in an AttributeError due to attempting string manipulation on an integer input, which further confirms that the code does not meet the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
