Example Answer:
`x` is created by joining each lowercase letter in the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the string representation of `n` will only contain digits, not letters. Therefore, the list comprehension will not have any elements to iterate over, resulting in an empty string being joined. Hence, `x` will be an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an empty string**
