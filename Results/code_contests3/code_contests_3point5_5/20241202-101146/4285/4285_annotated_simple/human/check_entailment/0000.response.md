Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem described in the prompt. The program is attempting to check if a given string is a palindrome by converting it to lowercase and checking if it is equal to its reverse. This is not the correct approach to find the n-th even-length palindrome number.

The program should generate the n-th even-length palindrome number, which involves constructing numbers that are palindromic by design, not checking if a given string is a palindrome.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
