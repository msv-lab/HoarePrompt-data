Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem described. The function `func_1` is attempting to check if a given input `n` is a palindrome, but the problem requires finding the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. Additionally, the logic inside the function is incorrect as it is trying to convert alphabetic characters to lowercase and check if the input is a palindrome, which is not relevant to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
