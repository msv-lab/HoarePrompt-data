You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pari has a friend who loves palindrome numbers. A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward or backward. For example 12321, 100001 and 1 are palindrome numbers, while 112 and 1021 are not.

Pari is trying to love them too, but only very special and gifted people can understand the beauty behind palindrome numbers. Pari loves integers with even length (i.e. the numbers with even number of digits), so she tries to see a lot of big palindrome numbers with even length (like a 2-digit 11 or 6-digit 122221), so maybe she could see something in them.

Now Pari asks you to write a program that gets a huge integer n from the input and tells what is the n-th even-length positive palindrome number?

Input

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10100 000).

Output

Print the n-th even-length palindrome number.

Examples

Input

1


Output

11


Input

10


Output

1001

Note

The first 10 even-length palindrome numbers are 11, 22, 33, ... , 88, 99 and 1001.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
