The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, the program returns True if the value of `n` is equal to its reverse; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return True if the value of `n` is equal to its reverse. If the value of `n` is not equal to its reverse, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns `True` if the value of n is equal to its reverse. If the value of n is not equal to its reverse, it returns `False`.**
