According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If there are more iterations based on the input value, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted based on the last iteration of the loop.
State: **If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9, `c` is set to 1, and then based on the new value of `a`, if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) then print -1, else calculate the result of `a / 4 + c` for the next iteration.**
