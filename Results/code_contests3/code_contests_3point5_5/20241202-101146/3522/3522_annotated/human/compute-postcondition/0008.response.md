According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a` and the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If `a` is in the list, the loop will print -1, otherwise it will print the result of `a / 4 + c`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop behavior was not specified. Since we do not have information about the specific values of `a` and `c` at the end of the last iteration, we cannot determine the exact states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration. Therefore, we need more information about the values of `a` and `c` at the end of the previous iteration in order to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
