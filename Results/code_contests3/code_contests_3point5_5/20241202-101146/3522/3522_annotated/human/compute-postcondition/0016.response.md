Example Answer: 
Initially, `a` is taken as input. If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. Then, based on the new value of `a`, if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) then -1 is printed, else the result of `a / 4 + c` is calculated for the next iteration. Since the input value of `a` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output state without knowing the input value.
Output State: **Dependent on the input value of `a`**
