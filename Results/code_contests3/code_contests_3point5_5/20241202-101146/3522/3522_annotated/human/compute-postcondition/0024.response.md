Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a specified number of input values. For each input value, it checks if the value is odd, subtracts 9 from it if it is odd, sets a flag `c` to 1 if the value was odd, and then prints -1 if the value is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the value divided by 4 plus the flag `c`. The final value of `c` will be 1 if at least one of the input values was odd; otherwise, it will remain 0.**
