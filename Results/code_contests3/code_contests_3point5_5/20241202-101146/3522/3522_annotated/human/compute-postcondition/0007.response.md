Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, then `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. The remainder of the new `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a` or `c`. After that, the code snippet checks if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`.

Output State: **Dependent on the value of `a`, if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`.**
