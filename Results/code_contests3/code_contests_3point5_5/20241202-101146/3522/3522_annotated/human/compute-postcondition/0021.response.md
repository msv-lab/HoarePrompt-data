Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. If `a` is not in the set, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. If `a` is an odd number, `c` is assigned the value 1, otherwise `c` remains 0. Based on the initial state, we do not have the value of `a`. Therefore, the output state can be either `c` is 1 or `c` is 0.
Output State: **`c` is 1 or `c` is 0**
