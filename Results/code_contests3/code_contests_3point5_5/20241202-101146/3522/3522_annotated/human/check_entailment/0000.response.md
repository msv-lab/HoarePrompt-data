Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates over a specified number of input values, checks if each value is odd, subtracts 9 from it if it is odd, sets a flag `c` to 1 if the value was odd, and then prints -1 if the value is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the value divided by 4 plus the flag `c`. This logic ensures that the program calculates the maximum possible number of composite summands for each input value as required by the problem description.
