Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
1
6

Expected Output:
1

Actual Output:
-1

For the input value of 6, the program should output 1 as 6 can be represented as 4 + 2 which are composite numbers. However, the program incorrectly outputs -1 for this case. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
