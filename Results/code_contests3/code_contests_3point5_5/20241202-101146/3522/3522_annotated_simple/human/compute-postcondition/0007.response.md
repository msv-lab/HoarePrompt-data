Example Answer:
If `a` is not divisible by 2, then `a` is updated by subtracting 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is one of the numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `a` is divided by 4 and added with the value of `c`.

Output State: **`ni` is 1, `a` is updated based on the condition, `c` is set based on the condition. The result is either -1 or the division of `a` by 4 added with `c`.**
