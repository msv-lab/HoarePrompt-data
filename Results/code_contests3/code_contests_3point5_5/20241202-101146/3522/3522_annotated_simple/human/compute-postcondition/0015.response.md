According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ni` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the input value must be greater than 0.
State: **`ni` is 1, `a` is updated based on the condition, `c` is 1, `a` is decreased by 9 if a is odd, the output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else `a` / 4 + `c`, for the loop to execute again the input value must be greater than 0**
