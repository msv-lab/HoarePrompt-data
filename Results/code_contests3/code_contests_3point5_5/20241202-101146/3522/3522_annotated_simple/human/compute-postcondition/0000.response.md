According to the code, the loop will execute `input()` number of times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `input()` must be greater than 0. Since each query contains a single positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. So, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to `ni` is a positive integer and `ni` is 1.
State: **Each query contains a single positive integer `ni` (1 ≤ `ni` ≤ 10^9), for the loop to execute `ni` is a positive integer and `ni` is 1**
