Functionality: **The function `func` reads a series of positive integers `a` from the user, adjusts the value of `a` based on whether it is odd, and then calculates a result based on specific conditions. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1. It then checks if `a` is in a predefined set of numbers, and if it is, it prints -1; otherwise, it calculates `a` divided by 4 and adds `c` to the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
