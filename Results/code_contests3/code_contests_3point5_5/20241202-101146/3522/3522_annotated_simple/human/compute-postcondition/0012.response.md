Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The value of `c` is now 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ni` is 1, `a` is updated based on the condition, `c` is 1, `a` is decreased by 9.
Output State: **`ni` is 1, `a` is updated based on the condition, `c` is 1, `a` is decreased by 9**
