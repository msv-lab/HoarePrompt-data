Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated based on the condition. If `a` % 2 != 0, `c` is set to 1 and `a` is reduced by 9. Then, based on the updated value of `a`, the code either prints -1 if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or prints `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. 
Output State: **`ni` is 1, `a` has been updated based on the condition, `c` is either 0 or 1, and a value has been returned based on the conditions.**
