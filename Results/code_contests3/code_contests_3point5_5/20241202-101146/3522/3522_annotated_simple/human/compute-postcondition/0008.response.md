According to the code, the loop can execute based on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ni` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 1.
State: **`ni` is 1, `a` is updated based on the condition, `c` is set based on the condition. The result is either -1 or the division of `a` by 4 added with `c`, for the loop to execute one more time the input value must be greater than 1**
