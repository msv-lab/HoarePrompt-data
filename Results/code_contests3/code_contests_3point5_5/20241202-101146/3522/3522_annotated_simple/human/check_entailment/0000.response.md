Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands for each query. It first checks if the input number `a` is odd, if so, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1. Then, it checks if `a` is one of the numbers that cannot be split into composite summands, if so, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of summands by dividing `a` by 4 and adding `c` if it was originally an odd number.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and outputs the correct result for each query.
