Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The code is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input number is already a composite number greater than 1. The code only checks for a specific set of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and if the input number is not in this set, it divides the number by 4 and adds a constant 'c'. This logic does not cover cases where the input number can be represented as a sum of composite summands. 

For example, if the input is 12, the code will output 3 which is the correct answer. However, if the input is 15, the code will output 4 which is incorrect. The correct answer for 15 should be 3 (15 = 9 + 3 + 3). 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
