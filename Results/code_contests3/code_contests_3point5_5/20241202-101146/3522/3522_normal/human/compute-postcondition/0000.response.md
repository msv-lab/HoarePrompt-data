According to the code, the loop will execute 'input()' number of times. The loop will execute if the value of 'input()' is greater than or equal to 1. As each query value ni is a positive integer greater than 1, we need to adjust the state before the loop starts to indicate that 'input()' is at least 1.
State: **Each query value ni is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute 'input()' is at least 1**
