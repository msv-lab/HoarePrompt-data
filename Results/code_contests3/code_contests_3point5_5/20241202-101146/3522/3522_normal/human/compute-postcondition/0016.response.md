Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the new input value, which can be any value. `c` is assigned 1 if `a` is odd and 0 if `a` is even. Therefore, after execution, `a` will hold the new input value, and `c` will be either 1 or 0 based on the parity of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the new input value, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, otherwise `c` is 0**
