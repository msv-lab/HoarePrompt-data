Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since each query value `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the value of `a` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: Each query value `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a positive integer.
Output State: **Each query value `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a positive integer**
