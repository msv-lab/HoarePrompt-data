Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its current value. The previous value of `a` is unknown as it was assigned the input value. Therefore, after execution, `a` will be updated accordingly. The value of `c` remains 0 as it is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on the input value, `c` is 0**
