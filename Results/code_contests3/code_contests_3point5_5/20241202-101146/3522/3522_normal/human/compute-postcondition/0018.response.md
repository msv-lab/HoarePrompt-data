Example Answer:
`a` is reassigned the value of `a` minus 9. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the new value of `a` is `a - 9`. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned the new input value - 9, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the new input value - 9, `c` is 0**
