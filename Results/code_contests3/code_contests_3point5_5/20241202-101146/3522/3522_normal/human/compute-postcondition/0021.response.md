Example Answer:
If `a` is an odd number, `a` will be updated to `a - 9` and `c` will be set to 1. If `a` is one of the numbers in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 will be printed. Otherwise, `a` will be divided by 4 and added to `c`, and the result will be printed. 
Output State: **Depending on the value of `a`, either -1 will be printed or the result of `a / 4 + c` will be printed.**
