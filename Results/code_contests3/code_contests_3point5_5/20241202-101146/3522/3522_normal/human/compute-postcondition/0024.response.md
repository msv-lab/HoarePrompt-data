Functionality: ** The function `func` iterates over a range of values based on user input. For each iteration, it takes an input value `a`, performs certain operations based on whether `a` is odd, and then prints a specific output. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1. It then checks if `a` is in a predefined set of values and prints -1 if it is, otherwise it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
