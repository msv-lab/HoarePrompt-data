Example Answer: 
If `a` is an even number, `c` is set to 1. If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed. Since the initial state of `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, and there is no information given about `a`, `c`, or `n`, the output state can vary depending on the input values. If `a` is even, `c` will be set to 1 and -1 will be printed. If `a` is not in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then the value of `a / 4 + c` will be printed.
Output State: **Output state can vary depending on the input values**
