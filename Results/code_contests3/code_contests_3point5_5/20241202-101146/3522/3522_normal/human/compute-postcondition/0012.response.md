Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` is 1. The value of `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated based on the input value, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on the input value, `c` is 1**
