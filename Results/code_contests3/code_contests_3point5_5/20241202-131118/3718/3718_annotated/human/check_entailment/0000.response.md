Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program defines a function that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. However, the program does not actually solve the problem described in the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum detection radius for a radar given the coordinates of a city and the flatland ring surrounding it. The program does not implement this logic and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
