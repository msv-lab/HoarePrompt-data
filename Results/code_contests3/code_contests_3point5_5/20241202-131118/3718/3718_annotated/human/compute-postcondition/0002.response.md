Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points and calculates the Euclidean distance between them using the formula sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2). The function returns the calculated distance. The precondition states that x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers within the range -10^4 to 10^4 and x1 is not equal to x2 or y1 is not equal to y2.**
