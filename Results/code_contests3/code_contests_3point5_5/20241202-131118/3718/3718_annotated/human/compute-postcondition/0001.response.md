The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1, y1, x2, y2`, which are integers satisfying the constraints -10^4 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^4 and x1 != x2 or y1 != y2. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integers `x1, y1, x2, y2` representing two points, and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points and returns the Euclidean distance between them.**
