The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraint |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 104. After executing the function body, the program returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between x1 and x2, and y1 and y2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters within the specified constraints and calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of their differences. 
Functionality: **The function accepts integer parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 satisfying |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 104 and returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between x1 and x2, and y1 and y2.**
