Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly defines a function `func_1` to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.
- The code reads the input for the coordinates of the cities and the flatland rings and calculates the distance between the two cities using the `func_1` function.
- The code then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The output is formatted to display the minimum detection radius with 6 decimal places.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases as specified.
