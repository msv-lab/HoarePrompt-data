Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes the coordinates and radii of the city and flatland ring as input. It calculates the distance between the two points and then determines the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

For all potential cases, the program correctly computes the minimum detection radius as per the given conditions of the problem. It handles scenarios where the sum of radii is less than the distance between the points, as well as cases where the absolute difference of radii is greater than the distance between the points. The program also formats the output to the required precision.

Hence, based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented in the program, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
