The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points in a Cartesian plane, calculates the Euclidean distance between these two points using the distance formula, and returns the result. The function correctly computes the Euclidean distance between the two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as described in the annotations. The function handles any integer values within the specified range (-10^4 to 10^4).
