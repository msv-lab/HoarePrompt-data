Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). However, the problem description requires finding the minimum detection radius for a radar that can detect both flatland rings. The program does not address the problem requirements and therefore does not follow the problem description.
