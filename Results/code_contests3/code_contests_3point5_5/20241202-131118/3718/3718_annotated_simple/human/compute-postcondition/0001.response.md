The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, and y2, all of which are integers within the range -10000 to 10000. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing two points in a Cartesian plane and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points in a Cartesian plane and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points.**
