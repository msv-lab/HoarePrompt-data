Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the given input of city coordinates and flatland ring distances. It considers all possible scenarios where the radar can be placed to detect the movements of both flatland rings. The formula used to calculate the minimum detection radius is based on the distance between the two cities and their respective radii. The program handles cases where the circles do not intersect, intersect at one point, or one circle is completely inside the other circle. The output is formatted to display the result with the required precision. Overall, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
