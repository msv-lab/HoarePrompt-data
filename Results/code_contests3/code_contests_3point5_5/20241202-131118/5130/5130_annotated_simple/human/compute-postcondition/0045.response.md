Output State: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `col` is incremented by 2, `i` is 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` contains the index of the last element in `comps` list that was updated, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is updated to the value of `col`, for the loop to execute again `j` needs to be reassigned the value of `p[j]` and `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j`, `comps[j]` is updated to the value of `col`.
