Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is assigned the value 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `comps[i] == 0`, then all elements in the `comps` list have been assigned the value of `col`, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the last element in `comps` list that was updated, and `col` remains the same.***
