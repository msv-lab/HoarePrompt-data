Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `col` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`**
