Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element parsed by `map` from the input split by spaces. The variable `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5.
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5**
