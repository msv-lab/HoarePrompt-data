Example Answer:
A list `comps` is created with `n` elements, each initialized to 0. The value of `n` is known to be an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0**
