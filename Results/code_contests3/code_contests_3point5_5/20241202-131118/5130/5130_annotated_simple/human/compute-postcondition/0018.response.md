Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, but the value of `col` is not specified in the initial state. The loop will execute again when `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, but the initial state of `p[j]` is also not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: comps[j] is assigned the value of col.
Output State: **comps[j] is assigned the value of col**
