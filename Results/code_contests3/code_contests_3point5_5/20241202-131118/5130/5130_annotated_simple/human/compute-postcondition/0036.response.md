According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `i` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` contains the index of the last element in `comps` list that was updated, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than `n+1`**
