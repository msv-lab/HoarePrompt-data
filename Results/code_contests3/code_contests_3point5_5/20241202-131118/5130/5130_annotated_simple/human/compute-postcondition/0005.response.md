According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variables `n` and `col` are already initialized appropriately. However, to ensure the loop executes, the value of `i` should be set to 0 at the beginning.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is assigned the value 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
