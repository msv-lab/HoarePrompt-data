According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `comps` list and the index `p[j]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `p[j]` is used as an index. For the loop to execute the first time, the value at index `p[j]` in the `comps` list needs to be 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is assigned the value 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is 0.**
