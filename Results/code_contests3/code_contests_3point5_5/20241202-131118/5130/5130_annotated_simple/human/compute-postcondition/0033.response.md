Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `col` is incremented by 1. The values of `comps` are updated accordingly. The value of `j` is assigned the new value of `p[j]`, and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` is set to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with updated values, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, updated `comps` list, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`**
