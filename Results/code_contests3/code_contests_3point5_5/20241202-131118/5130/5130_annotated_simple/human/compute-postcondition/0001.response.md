Example Answer:
Each element in the list `p` is assigned the value of `(int(v) - 1)` for each `v` in the input provided by `raw_input().split()`. Since the input is not specified, the exact values of `p` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5.
Output State: **n is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5**
