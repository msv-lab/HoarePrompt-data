According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is the new value of `p[j]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` must be 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `comps[p[j]]` which should be set to 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
