Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where each element corresponds to the value of `col`, `col` is the total number of unique colors used, `i` is n-1, `j` is the index of the last element in `comps` list that was updated. All elements in the `comps` list have been updated with the value of `col` after all iterations of the loop have finished.**
