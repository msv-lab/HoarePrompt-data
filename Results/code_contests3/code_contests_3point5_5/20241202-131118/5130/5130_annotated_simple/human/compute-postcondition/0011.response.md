Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, where `p` is a list. The value of `j` is initially 0, so `p[0]` will determine the new value of `j`. Since `comps[0]` is equal to 0, `p[0]` will not affect the value of `j`, so `j` will remain 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, comps is a list of n elements where comps[i] is equal to 1 for the first element and 0 for the rest, col is assigned the value 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0, comps[0] is equal to 0, j is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, comps is a list of n elements where comps[i] is equal to 1 for the first element and 0 for the rest, col is assigned the value 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0, comps[0] is equal to 0, j is 0**
