Example Answer:
The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. The new value of `j` will depend on the previous value of `j` and `p`. Since the initial state of `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, the output state will depend on the initial values of `j` and `p`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is assigned the new value of `p[j]`**
