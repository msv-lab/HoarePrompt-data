Example Answer:
j is assigned the value of p[j]. The value of p[j] is used to index comps, and the loop will execute again if comps[p[j]] is equal to 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: comps[j] is assigned the value of col, for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0.
Output State: **comps[j] is assigned the value of col, for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0**
