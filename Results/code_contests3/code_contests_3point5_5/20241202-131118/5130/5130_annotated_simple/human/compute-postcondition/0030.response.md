Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `col` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**
