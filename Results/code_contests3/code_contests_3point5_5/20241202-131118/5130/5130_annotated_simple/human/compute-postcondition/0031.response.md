According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `comps[p[j]]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 2*10^5, `comps` contains `n` elements with `comps[i]` assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is the new value of `p[j]`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` needs to be 0, and `j` needs to be assigned the value of `p[j]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `j` is the new value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**
