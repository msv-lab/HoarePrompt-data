According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. To ensure the loop executes again, `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to be equal to 0 after the assignment. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: comps[j] is assigned the value of col, for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0**
