According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. 

1. The loop can execute only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0.
2. Right before the loop, `p[j]` is equal to 0, so `comps[p[j]]` refers to the first element of the `comps` list.
3. `comps[i]` is equal to 1 for the first element and 0 for the rest, so for the loop to execute the first time, `comps[0]` should be equal to 0.
4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where `comps[i]` is equal to 1 for the first element and 0 for the rest, `col` is assigned the value 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[0]` is equal to 0**
