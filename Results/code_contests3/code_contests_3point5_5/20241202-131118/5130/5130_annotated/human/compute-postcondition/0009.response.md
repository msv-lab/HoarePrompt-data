Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is currently 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in `comps` is equal to 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The element at index `i` in `comps` is equal to 1**
