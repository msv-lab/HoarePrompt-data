According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
