Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list where all elements are equal to 3, `col` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the final value based on the chain of indices in list `p`, and `comps` is updated accordingly with `col`. The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `comps` have been updated to `col` where the loop condition was satisfied.***
