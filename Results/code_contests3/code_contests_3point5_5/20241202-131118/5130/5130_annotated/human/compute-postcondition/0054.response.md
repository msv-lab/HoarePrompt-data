Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input, processes it, and prints a value based on certain conditions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The code initializes variables, processes the input data to update the `comps` list, calculates the value of `col`, and prints the sum of 0 or 1 based on the conditions.**
