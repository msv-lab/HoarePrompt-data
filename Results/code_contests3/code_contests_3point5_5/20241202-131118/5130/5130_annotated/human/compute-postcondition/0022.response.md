Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros. If `comps[i]` equals 0, all elements in `comps` are equal to `col`, `col` is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is the next valid index in `p` such that `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
