Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list where all elements are equal to 3, `col` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the final value based on the chain of indices in list `p`, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `comps` is updated accordingly with `col`, for the loop to execute `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0 and for the loop to execute one more time `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0**.
