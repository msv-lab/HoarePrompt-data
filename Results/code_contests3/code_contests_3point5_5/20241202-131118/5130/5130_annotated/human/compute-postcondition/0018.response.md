Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list where comps[j] is equal to col, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is a valid index in `p` such that `comps[p[j]]` is 0, and `j` is updated to the new value of `p[j] for the loop to execute again, `j` is updated to the new value of `p[j], `comps[j]` is equal to `col`.**
