Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values to integers and stores them in the variable `b`. The `raw_input().split()` function splits the input values by spaces. Since `n` is an input integer, and `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, the output state will be `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, and `b` contains the input values converted to integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers**
