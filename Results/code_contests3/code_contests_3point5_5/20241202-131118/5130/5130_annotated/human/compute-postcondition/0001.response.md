Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the list comprehension result of applying the `int(v) - 1` operation to each value `v` in the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since `n` is an input integer, the values in the list `p` will be `n - 1` for each element. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`**
