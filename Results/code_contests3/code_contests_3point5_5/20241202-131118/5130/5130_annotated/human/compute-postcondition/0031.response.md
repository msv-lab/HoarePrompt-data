According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the value at index `p[j]` in list `comps` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, it means the value at index `p[j]` in list `comps` needs to be 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is `n - 1`, `b` contains the input values converted to integers, `comps` is a list where all elements are equal to `col`, `col` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to the new value at index `j` in list `p`, value at index `p[j]` in list `comps` is 0**
