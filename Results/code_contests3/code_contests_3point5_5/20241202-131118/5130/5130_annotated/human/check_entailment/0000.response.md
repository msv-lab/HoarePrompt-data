Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. The program processes the input data, updates the `comps` list based on the permutation `p`, calculates the value of `col`, and prints the sum of 0 or 1 based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

The program ensures that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements by updating the `comps` list and calculating the value of `col`. It correctly handles the case where all skewers are already in the correct position (`col == 1`) and the case where all skewers need to be reversed (`sum(b) == 0`).

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
