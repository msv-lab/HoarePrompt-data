Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5**
