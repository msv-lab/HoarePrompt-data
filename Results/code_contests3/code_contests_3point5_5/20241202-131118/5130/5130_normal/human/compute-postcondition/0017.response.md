Output State: **n is greater than 0, p is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values, i is 0, comps is a list of n elements where the element at index i is incremented by 1, col is incremented by 1, j is adjusted so that p[j] is a valid index in comps and comps[p[j]] is equal to 0, comps[j] is assigned the value of col for the loop to execute one more time, j is updated to the value at index j in list p**.
