Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values, `i` is 2, `comps` is a list of n elements where each element is incremented by 1, `col` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `j` is such that `p[j]` is a valid index in `comps`, `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is not 0, then `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is equal to 2, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` for the last time**
