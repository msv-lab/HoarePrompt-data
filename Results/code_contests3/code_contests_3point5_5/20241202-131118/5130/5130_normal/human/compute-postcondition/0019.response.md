Output State: **n is greater than 0, p is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values, i is 0, comps is a list of n elements where each element is incremented by 1, col is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, j is such that p[j] is a valid index in comps and comps[p[j]] is not equal to 0, j is updated based on the value at index j in list p, comps[j] is assigned the value of col, the loop stops when there are no more valid indices left in p**
