Example Answer:
The variable `col` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values, b is a map object containing the integers from the input split, comps is a list of n elements initialized with 0, col is 0**
