Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values, `i` is equal to n-1, `comps` is a list of n elements where each element is incremented by 1, `col` is equal to the total number of unique components in comps, `j` is such that `p[j]` is a valid index in `comps` and `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, the loop stops when there are no more valid indices left in p.**
