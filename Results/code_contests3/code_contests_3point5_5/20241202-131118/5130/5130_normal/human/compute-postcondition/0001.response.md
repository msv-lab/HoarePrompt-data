Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list `p` by taking input, splitting it, converting each element to an integer, and subtracting 1 from it. The input values are unknown, but since `n` is a positive integer, `p` will contain elements that are 1 less than the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the input values**
