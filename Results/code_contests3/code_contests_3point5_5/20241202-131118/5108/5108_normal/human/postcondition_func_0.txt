The function `func` reads a string `a` from the user input. It then iterates over each character of `a` and if any character is 'H', 'Q', or '9', it prints 'YES', assigns 'tstr123' to `a`, and breaks out of the loop. After the loop, if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and has no explicit return value.
