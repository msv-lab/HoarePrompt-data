Example Answer: 
The code snippet just prints 'YES' and does not have any impact on the initial state variables `p` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a string with the value 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a string with the value 'tstr123'**
