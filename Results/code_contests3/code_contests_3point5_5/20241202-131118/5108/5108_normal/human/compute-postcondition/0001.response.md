According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If the input string `a` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the string `p` containing between 1 and 100 characters does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a string with at least 1 character.
State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, for the loop to execute `a` is a string with at least 1 character**
