Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty iterable. If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123' and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `i` is not in ['H', 'Q', '9'], `a` remains unchanged and the loop continues. The loop will execute another time if `i` is not 'H', 'Q', '9' or `a` does not contain 'tstr123'.***
