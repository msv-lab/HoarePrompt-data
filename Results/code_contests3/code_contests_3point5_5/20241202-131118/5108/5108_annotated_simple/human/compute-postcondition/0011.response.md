Postcondition: ***p is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII-code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive. a is a non-empty string. If i is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], then if a is 'tstr123', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
