Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. The function `raw_input()` takes user input as a string and assigns it to `a`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: p is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII-code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a string containing user input.
Output State: **p is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII-code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a string containing user input**
