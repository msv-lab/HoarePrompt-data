Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `a` as input and iterates through each character. If any character in `a` is 'H', 'Q', or '9', it prints 'YES' and updates `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of the characters match, it prints 'NO'. The function executes an HQ9+ program represented by the input string `p`, but there is a missing return value or explicit output.**
