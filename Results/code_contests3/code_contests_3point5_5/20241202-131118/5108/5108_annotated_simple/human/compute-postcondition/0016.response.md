Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII-code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is a non-empty string, processing the next character in 'a' for the loop to execute one more time. If the character `i` in 'a' is 'H', 'Q', or '9', 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
