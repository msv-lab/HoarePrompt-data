Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII-code of each character between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is a non-empty string, processing the next character in 'a' for the loop to execute one more time, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
