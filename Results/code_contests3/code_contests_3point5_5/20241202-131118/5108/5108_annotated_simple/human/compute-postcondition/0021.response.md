The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to execute a program written in HQ9+ language, represented by a string `p` containing ASCII-codes of characters between 33 and 126 inclusive. The function does not return any value explicitly, as the execution of the program will result in some output or side effects based on the HQ9+ commands in the input string `p`.
