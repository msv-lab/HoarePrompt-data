According to the code, the loop does not execute due to the break statement. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the condition for the loop to execute must be satisfied. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is len(nums) - 1. Since the loop did not execute, the index `i` was not incremented. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the `i` index needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums)**
