According to the code, the loop will only execute if `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False which means the loop will not execute. To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `flag` to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1**
