According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index `i` is less than the length of the list `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1**
