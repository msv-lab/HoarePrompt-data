Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
