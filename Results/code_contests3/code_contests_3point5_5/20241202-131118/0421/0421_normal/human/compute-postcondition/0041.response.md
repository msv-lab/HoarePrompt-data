According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` has at least 2 elements. To execute the loop one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` must be less than 2 to avoid setting `flag` to False and breaking out of the loop.
State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time if the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2**
