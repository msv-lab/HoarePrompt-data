Example Answer: 
The value of `flag` is unchanged as it is already False. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1.
Output State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1**
