According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object. For the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must not be empty. Therefore, `nums` needs to be adjusted so that it is not empty.
State: **n is a string representing the user input, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty**
