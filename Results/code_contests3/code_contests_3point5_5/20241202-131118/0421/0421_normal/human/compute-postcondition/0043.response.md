Output State: `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time if the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
