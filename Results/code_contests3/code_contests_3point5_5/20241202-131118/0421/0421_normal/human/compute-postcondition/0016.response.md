Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i + 2]` is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
