Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
