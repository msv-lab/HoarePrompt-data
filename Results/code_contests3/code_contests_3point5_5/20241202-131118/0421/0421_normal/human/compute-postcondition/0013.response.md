According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, `flag`, and the condition related to the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next iteration of the loop must satisfy the conditions. Specifically, the next iteration should ensure that the absolute difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i + 2]` is not greater than or equal to 2 to prevent setting `flag` to False and breaking out of the loop.

State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i+1]` and `nums[i + 2]` is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again.**
