Output State: `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1, for the loop to execute the first time `flag` remains True and `nums` is not empty. The absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
