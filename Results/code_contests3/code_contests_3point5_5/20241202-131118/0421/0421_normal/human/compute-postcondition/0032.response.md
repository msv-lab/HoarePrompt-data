Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
