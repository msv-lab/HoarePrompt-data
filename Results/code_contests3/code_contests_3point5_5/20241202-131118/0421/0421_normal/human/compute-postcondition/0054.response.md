Functionality: **The function `func` reads the input `n` as a string representing the size of an array and a list of positive integers. It then iterates over the list `nums` and checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2. If the condition is met for all elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function implicitly assumes the constraints provided for `n` and `ai`. However, the code does not handle invalid inputs, error checking, or edge cases where the list may become empty during execution.**
