Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums). If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater or equal to 2, then the flag is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
