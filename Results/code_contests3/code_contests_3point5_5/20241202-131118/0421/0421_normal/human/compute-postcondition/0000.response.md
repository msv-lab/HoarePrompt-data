Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` is now a string representing the user input. The array `ai` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a string representing the user input, ai is a list of n positive integers representing the height of a stack of ravioli.
Output State: **n is a string representing the user input, ai is a list of n positive integers representing the height of a stack of ravioli**
