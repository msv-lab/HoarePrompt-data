According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` could be either True or False, and `nums` has the maximum element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must remain True, and `nums` must not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed, `i` is len(nums) - 1, for the loop to execute again `flag` must remain True and `nums` must not be empty**
