According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` is not empty, the loop will execute. State before the loop starts: `n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0. 
State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
