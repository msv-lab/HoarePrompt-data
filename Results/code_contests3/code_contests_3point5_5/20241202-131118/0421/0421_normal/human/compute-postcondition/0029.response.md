According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than len(nums) - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums). So for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 1**
