According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time if the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2**
