Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time if the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
