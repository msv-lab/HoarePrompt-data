Output State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
