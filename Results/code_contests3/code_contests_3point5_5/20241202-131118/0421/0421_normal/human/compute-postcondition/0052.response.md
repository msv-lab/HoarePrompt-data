Output State: **`n` is a string representing the user input, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False (based on the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `nums`), `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the maximum element has been removed, `i` is len(nums) - 1. The loop will terminate when the flag is set to False or when the nums list is empty. The output 'YES' is printed if flag is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
