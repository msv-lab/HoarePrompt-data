Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input array has two stacks next to each other that differ in height by two or more. When this situation occurs, the algorithm should not sort the array correctly according to the problem description. The code only checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2, which is not sufficient to ensure the correct sorting behavior as described in the problem. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
