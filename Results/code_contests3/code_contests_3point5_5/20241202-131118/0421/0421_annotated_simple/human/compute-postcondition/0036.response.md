According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2. Also, the loop requires `i` to be less than the length of `nums` - 1. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
