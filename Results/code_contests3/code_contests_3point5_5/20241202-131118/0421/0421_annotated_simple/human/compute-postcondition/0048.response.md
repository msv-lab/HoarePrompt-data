Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 2 for the loop to execute another time. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks out. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
