According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with length of at least 2, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` should be at least 3 and `i` should be 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with length of at least 3, `i` is 1**
