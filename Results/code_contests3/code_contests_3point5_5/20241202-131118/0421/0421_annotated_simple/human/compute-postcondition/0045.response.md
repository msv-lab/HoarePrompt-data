According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1. Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`. If this condition is not met, the loop will execute one more time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 2 for the loop to execute another time**.
