Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
