According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a map object. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state to make sure `flag` remains True and `nums` is not empty. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object**
