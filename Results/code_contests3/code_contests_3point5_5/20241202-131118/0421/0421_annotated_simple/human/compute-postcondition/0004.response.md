According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of `nums` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `flag` is True does not affect the loop execution. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with length of at least 2, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
