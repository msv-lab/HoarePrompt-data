According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2 and `flag` is set to False, then the loop breaks. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map object with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1**.
