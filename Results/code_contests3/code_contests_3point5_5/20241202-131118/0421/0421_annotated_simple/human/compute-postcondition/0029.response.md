According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, which means there is still room for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2, `i` is less than len(nums) - 1**
