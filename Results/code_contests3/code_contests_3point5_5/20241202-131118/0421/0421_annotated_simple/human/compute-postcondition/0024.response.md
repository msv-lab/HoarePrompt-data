Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` remains True, and `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2 for the loop to execute. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
