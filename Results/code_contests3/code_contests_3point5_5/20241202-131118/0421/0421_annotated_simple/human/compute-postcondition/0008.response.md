Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with length of at least 2, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False, indicating a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
