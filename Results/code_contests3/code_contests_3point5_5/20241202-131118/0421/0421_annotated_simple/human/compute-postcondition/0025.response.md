According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` remains True, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `flag` should remain True unless the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` remains True, and `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than len(nums) - 2**
