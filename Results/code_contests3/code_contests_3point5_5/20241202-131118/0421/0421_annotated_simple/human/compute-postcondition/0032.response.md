Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 2, `i` is less than len(nums) - 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
