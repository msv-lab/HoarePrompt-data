Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, but now it is changed to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with length of at least 2, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
