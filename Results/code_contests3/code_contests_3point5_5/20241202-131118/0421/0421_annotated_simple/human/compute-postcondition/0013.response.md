According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `nums` must still have a length of at least 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 3, `i` is 2**.
