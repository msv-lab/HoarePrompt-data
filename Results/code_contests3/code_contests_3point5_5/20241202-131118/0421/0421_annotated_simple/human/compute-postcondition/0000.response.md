Example Answer:
n is assigned the value of input(), where input() accepts an input. The value of n is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of n. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, and ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, and ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100**
