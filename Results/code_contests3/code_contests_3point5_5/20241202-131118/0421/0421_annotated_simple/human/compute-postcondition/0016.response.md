Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 3, and `i` is 2. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
