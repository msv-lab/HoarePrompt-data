The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it is implied that the function works with an array of integers. The parameter constraints state that n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, and ai is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the function implicitly accepts an array of integers with the specified constraints.

The function `func` does not have a specified return value or output mentioned in the given information.
