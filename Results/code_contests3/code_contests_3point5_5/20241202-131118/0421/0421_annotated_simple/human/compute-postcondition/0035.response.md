According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, and `nums` is a map object with a length of at least 1 after removing the maximum element from it.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `flag` needs to be adjusted to True.
- `nums` needs to be adjusted to a non-empty map object.
  
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `flag` is True and `nums` is a non-empty map object**.
