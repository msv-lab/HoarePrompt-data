The function `func` takes input for the size of an array (n) and the elements of the array (ai). It then iterates through the array elements, checking if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is at least 2. If such a pair is found, the function sets the flag to False and exits the loop. After that, it removes the maximum element from the array. Finally, it prints either 'NO' if the flag is False or 'YES' if the flag is True. The function works with implicit parameters, an array of integers, and its purpose is to determine if there are consecutive elements with an absolute difference of at least 2 in the array.
