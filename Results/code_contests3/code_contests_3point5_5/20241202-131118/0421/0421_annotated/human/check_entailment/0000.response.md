Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by iterating over the stack heights and removing the tallest stack in each iteration. It updates a flag based on the absolute difference of adjacent stack heights, which determines whether the algorithm can sort the array correctly. Finally, it prints "YES" if the flag is True and "NO" if the flag is False, as specified in the problem description. The loop in the program ensures that the algorithm considers the sliding of ravioli from taller stacks onto shorter stacks, which is a key requirement for the sorting algorithm to work correctly.
