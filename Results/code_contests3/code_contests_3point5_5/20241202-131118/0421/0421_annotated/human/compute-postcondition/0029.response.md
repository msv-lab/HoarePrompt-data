According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 1, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so i is now len(nums) - 2
- The maximum number in `nums` must be removed again
- The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is maintained to be at least 2
- If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then flag remains False

State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2**
