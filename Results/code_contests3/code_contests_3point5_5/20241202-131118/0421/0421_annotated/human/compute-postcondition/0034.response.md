Example Answer:
The maximum number in the list `nums` has been removed. Since the list `nums` is not empty and the maximum number has been removed, the list `nums` is still not empty after the removal. The condition that there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2 still holds true. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 0, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified nums list with an absolute difference of less than 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 0, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified nums list with an absolute difference of less than 2**
