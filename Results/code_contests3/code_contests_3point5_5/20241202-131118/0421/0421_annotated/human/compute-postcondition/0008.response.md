Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time len(nums) is at least 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then flag is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
