Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is set to False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, flag depends on the presence of adjacent numbers with an absolute difference of at least 2 in the modified nums list. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
