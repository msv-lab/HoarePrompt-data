According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. The loop will iterate over the range of the length of `nums` - 1. Since the loop starts at index 0, the loop can execute if `nums` has at least 2 elements. 

Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2**
