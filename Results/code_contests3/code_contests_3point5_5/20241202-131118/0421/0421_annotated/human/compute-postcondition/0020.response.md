According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. Since i is len(nums) - 2, and nums is not empty, the loop will execute. For the loop to execute again, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and flag depends on the presence of adjacent numbers with an absolute difference of at least 2 in the modified nums list. 
State: **Output State: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, flag depends on the presence of adjacent numbers with an absolute difference of at least 2 in the modified nums list**
