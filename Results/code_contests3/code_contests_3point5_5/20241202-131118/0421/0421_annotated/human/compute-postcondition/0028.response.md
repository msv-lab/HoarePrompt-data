Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 1, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then flag is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
