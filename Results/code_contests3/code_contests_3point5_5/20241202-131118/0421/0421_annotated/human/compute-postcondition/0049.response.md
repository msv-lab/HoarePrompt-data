Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2. If there is at least one pair of adjacent numbers in `nums` with an absolute difference greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.**
