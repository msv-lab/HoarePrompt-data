Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False or remains True based on the modified nums list, nums is not empty, i is either 0 or len(nums) - 1. The loop removes the maximum element from nums each iteration and updates flag based on the presence of adjacent numbers in nums with an absolute difference of at least 2. The program prints 'NO' if flag is False, and 'YES' if flag is True.**
