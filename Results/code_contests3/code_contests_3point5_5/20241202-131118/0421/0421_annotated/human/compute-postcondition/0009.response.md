According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition specified in the loop statement is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 0, and len(nums) is at least 2.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop iterates over `len(nums) - 1`, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be updated to 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2. This condition must be maintained.
- No other changes are required in the provided state.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 1, for the loop to execute one more time len(nums) is at least 2, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2**
