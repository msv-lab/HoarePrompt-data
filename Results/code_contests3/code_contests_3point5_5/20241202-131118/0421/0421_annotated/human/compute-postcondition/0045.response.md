According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2**
