Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
