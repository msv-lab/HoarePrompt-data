Example Answer:
The value of `flag` is changed to False. The previous value of `flag` was True. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time len(nums) is at least 2. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time len(nums) is at least 2. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2.**
