Example Answer:
The value of `flag` is set to False. This assignment does not affect any other variables as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2**
