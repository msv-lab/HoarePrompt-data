According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition involving nums[i] and nums[i + 1]. If the absolute difference between these two numbers is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2, and the maximum number in nums has been removed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must have an absolute difference of at least 2.

State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 1, the maximum number in nums has been removed, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is at least 2**
