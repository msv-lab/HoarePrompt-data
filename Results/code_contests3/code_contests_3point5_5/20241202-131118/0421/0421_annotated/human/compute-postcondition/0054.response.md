Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the size of an array and a list of `n` positive integers `ai` representing the height of a stack of ravioli. It then iterates over the list `ai`, removing the maximum element each iteration, and updates a flag based on the absolute difference of adjacent numbers. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag is True, indicating the stack is stable, and 'NO' if the flag is False, indicating the stack is not stable. However, the function lacks explicit parameter handling and return statements based on the annotations provided.**
