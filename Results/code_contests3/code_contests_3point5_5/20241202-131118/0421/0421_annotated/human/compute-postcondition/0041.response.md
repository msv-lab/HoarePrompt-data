According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 as the loop is iterating over `nums` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the new state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2.**
