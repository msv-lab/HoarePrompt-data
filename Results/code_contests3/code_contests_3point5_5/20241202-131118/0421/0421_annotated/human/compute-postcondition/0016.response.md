Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 2, len(nums) is at least 2, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
