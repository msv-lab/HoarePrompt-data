According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than the length of nums minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1 and len(nums) is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1 to 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 2, len(nums) is at least 2, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2**
