Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The value of `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the array. The list `ai` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the size of the array; ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of the stack of ravioli.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the array; ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of the stack of ravioli.**
