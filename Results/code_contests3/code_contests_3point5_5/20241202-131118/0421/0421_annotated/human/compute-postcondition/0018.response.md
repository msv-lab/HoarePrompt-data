Output State: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is len(nums) - 2. After executing the code, the maximum number in nums is removed. The impact on flag depends on the newly modified nums list. If there still exists a pair of adjacent numbers with an absolute difference of at least 2 in the modified nums list, flag will be False; otherwise, flag will remain True.
