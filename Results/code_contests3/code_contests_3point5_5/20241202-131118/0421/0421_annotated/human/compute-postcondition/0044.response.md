Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and there are adjacent numbers in the modified `nums` list with an absolute difference of less than 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
