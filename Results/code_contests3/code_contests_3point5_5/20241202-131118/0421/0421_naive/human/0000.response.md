Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm for all potential cases. Specifically, it does not handle the scenario where two stacks of ravioli are next to each other and differ in height by two or more, causing the top ravioli of the taller stack to slide down on top of the lower stack. 

Example:
Input
3
3 1 2

Output
NO

In this case, the program will not produce the correct output as the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, resulting in an incorrect array {2, 2, 2}. This example demonstrates a scenario where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
