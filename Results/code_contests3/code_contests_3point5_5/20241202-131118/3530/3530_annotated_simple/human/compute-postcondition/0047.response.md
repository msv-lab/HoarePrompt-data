Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `i` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated with modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 2, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`***.
