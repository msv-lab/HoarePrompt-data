Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains 1, `dp` continues to be fully updated using modulo operation with `MOD`, `N` remains a positive integer, `a_{i,j}` values are either 0 or 1, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `a` remains a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` remains n, `mask` is still less than `1 << n + 1`, the loop to execute `j` remains at 1.***
