According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `_` is n. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should be less than n.
State: **`i` is 1, `dp` has dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) with the first row filled with 1s, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers obtained by mapping int to the input split by spaces, `_` is n, for the loop to execute `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `mask & 1 << j` is true, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the mentioned formula**.
