Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The value of `N`, `a_{i,j}`, and `MOD` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, the values of a_{i,j} are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, the values of a_{i,j} are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007**
