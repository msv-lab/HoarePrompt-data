According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if i is within the range from 0 to (2^n - 1). At the end of the last iteration, N is a positive integer and the loop executed for the first time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, i should be incremented by 1 and it should still be within the range from 0 to (2^n - 1).
State: **N is a positive integer, values of a_{i,j} are either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, a is a list of length n filled with lists of integers obtained by mapping int to the input split by spaces, _ is n, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) filled with zeros, for the loop to execute i is in the range from 0 to (2^n - 1), dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1, i is in the range from 0 to (2^n - 2)**
