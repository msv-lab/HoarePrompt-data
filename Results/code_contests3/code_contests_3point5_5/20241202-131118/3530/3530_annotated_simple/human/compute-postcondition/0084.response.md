Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `j` remain unchanged. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n` with the `j-th` bit set to 0 for the next value of `j`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **`i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n` with the `j-th` bit set to 0 for the next value of `j`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.**
