Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the previous value `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `j` satisfies the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, and then taking the modulus of the result with `MOD`.
Output State: **`i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `dp[i][mask]` has been updated and taken modulus by `MOD`**
