Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` is incremented by 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated after these operations. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `n`, `N`, `dp`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated according to the provided conditions.
Output State: **`i`, `n`, `N`, `dp`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated according to the provided conditions.**
