Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD` of its current value. The variables `i`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if else block executes, `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` maintain their initial values. The updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. `j` has been increased by 1 for the next iteration, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.
