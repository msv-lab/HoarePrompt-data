Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the new value, where the value of `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of the division of its previous value by `MOD`, `j` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the `j-th` bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.***
