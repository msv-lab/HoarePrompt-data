Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` maintain their initial values. For every possible value of `j` within the range of `n`, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. Each `dp[i][mask]` value has been incremented by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. After the loop executes for the second time, `j` becomes `n` and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`. Now, `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its value modulo `MOD`.***
