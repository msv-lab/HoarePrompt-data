Example Answer:
The code snippet updates each value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus by `MOD`. Additionally, it increments `dp[i][mask]` by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are already calculated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. Therefore, after executing the code, the updated Output State would be: All variables maintain their initial values, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated and incremented as described.
Output State: **All variables maintain their initial values, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated and incremented as described**
