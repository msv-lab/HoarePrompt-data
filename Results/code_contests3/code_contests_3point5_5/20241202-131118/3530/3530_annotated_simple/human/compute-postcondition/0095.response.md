Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, the variables `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` maintain their initial values. The values of `dp[i][mask]` have been updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` for all possible values of `j` within the range of `n`.**
