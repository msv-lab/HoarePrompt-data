Postcondition: ***`i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `dp[i][mask + 1]` have been updated based on conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` for all possible values of `j` within the range of `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
