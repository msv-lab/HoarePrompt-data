Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `n`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values. The value of `mask` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute another time if `n` is greater than 0. `j` remains 1. 
Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
