According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2 and `n` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
