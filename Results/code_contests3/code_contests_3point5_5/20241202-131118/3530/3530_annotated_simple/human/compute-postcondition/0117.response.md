Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` maintain their initial values. For every possible value of `j` within the range of `n`, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. Each `dp[i][mask]` value has been incremented by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. For the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)`, the state of the program is such that the if condition is true. `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`.**
