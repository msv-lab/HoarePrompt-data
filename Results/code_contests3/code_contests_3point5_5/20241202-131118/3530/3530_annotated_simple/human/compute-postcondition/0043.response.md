Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `i` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with modulus operation applied.***
