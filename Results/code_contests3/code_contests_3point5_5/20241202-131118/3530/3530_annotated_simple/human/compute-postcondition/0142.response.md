Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1. If `n` is greater than 0, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop for all valid `j` values in the range of `n`. The final `dp[i][mask]` will contain the accumulated values from all iterations of the loop.**
