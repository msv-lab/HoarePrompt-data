Postcondition: ***`i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. `dp[i][mask]` is then recalculated as the modulus of `MOD`.***
