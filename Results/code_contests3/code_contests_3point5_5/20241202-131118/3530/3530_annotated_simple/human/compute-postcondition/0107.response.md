Output State: **All variables maintain their initial values. `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` for all possible values of `j` within the range of `n`. Each value of `dp[i][mask]` has been taken modulus by `MOD`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next value within the range of `n`. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and each updated value is taken modulus by `MOD`.**
