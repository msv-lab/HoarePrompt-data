The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `i` is 1, `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 1, and `dp` has dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) with the first row filled with 1s. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` will result in updating the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on this calculation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `dp` has been updated based on the formula, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers obtained by mapping int to the input split by spaces, `_` is n, `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `mask & 1 << j` is true.**
