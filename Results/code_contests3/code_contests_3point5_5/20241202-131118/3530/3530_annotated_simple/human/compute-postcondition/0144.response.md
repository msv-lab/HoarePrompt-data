According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is now 0. Additionally, `mask` needs to be updated to reflect the fact that it is incremented by 2 before the loop starts.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
