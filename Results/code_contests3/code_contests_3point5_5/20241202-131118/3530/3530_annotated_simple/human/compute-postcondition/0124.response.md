Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are unknown. The result is stored in `dp[i][mask]` after taking modulo `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` maintain their initial values, `j` is `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions stated, with each value taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` maintain their initial values, `j` is `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions stated, with each value taken modulo `MOD`**
