Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` and the value of `MOD` are not provided, so the output state is that `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its new value after taking the modulo operation.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to its new value after taking the modulo operation**
