According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a certain value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **After the if else block executes, the variables `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` maintain their initial values. The updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after applying the modulo operation is dependent on the conditions that `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.**
