Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. For all possible values of `j` within the range of `n`, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated and incremented based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, and each value of `dp[i][mask]` has been taken modulus by `MOD`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be the next value within the range of `n`.***
