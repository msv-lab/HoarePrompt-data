Output State: **After the loop has executed completely, `i` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated with modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, `a_{i,j}` values are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1`. The values of `dp[i][mask]` have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid combinations of `i` and `mask`.**
