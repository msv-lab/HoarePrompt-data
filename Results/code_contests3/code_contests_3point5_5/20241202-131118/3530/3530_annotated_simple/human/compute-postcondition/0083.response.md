Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n` with the `j-th` bit set to 0 for the next value of `j`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1.***
