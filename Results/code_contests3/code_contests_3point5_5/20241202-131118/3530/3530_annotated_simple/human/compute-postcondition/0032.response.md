Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the program maintains the initial conditions mentioned in the precondition. The program checks if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and if `mask & 1 << j` is true. If both conditions are met, the program updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the specified formula.***
