Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 2, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
