According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `mask` is incremented by 2, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **`i`, `n`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask` maintain their initial values. `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its new value after taking the modulo operation. `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` is incremented by 2, `j` is 2**
