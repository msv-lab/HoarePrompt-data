Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `j` is not given, so the exact value of `mask ^ 1 << j` cannot be determined. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulus by `MOD`. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, the next value of `j` within the range of `n` should be considered.
Output State: **The values of i, dp, N, a_{i,j}, MOD, a, _, mask remain the same, and dp[i][mask] has been updated and taken modulus by MOD. The loop should consider the next value of j within the range of n.**
