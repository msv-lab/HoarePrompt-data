Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `dp` is fully updated with modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1`, for the loop to execute `j` is 0. The element at index `j` of the list at index `i - 1` of `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.***
