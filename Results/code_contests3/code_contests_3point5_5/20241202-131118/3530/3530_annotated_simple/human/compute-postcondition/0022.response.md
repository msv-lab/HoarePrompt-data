Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of variables `i`, `n`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `mask & 1 << j` remain the same. After execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the sum of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 
Output State: **`i` is 1, `dp` has dimensions (n+1) x (2^n) with the first row filled with 1s, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers obtained by mapping int to the input split by spaces, `_` is n, for the loop to execute `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `mask & 1 << j` is true, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the mentioned formula.**
