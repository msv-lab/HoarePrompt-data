Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of the current value. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus.
Output State: **After the execution, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with modulus operation applied.**
