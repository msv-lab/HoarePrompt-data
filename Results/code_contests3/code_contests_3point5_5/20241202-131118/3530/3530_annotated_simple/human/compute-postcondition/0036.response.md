Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
