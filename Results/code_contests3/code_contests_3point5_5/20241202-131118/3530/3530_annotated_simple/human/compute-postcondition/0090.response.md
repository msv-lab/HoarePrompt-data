Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, the variables `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` maintain their initial values. The updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is dependent on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.***
