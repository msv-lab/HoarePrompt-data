According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `mask` needs to be less than `1 << n`. 
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 2.**
