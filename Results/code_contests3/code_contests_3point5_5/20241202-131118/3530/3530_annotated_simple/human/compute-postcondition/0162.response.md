Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values to construct a matrix of size N x N, where each element a_{i,j} can be either 0 or 1. It then performs calculations on this matrix using dynamic programming techniques to calculate and print a specific value. The function does not accept any parameters and works solely based on the input data provided during execution.**
