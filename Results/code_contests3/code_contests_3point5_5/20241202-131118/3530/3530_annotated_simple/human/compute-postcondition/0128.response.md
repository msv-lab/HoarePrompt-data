According to the code, the loop can execute again if `mask` is within the range of `(1, 1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1**
