Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are not explicitly mentioned, so we don't have enough information to calculate the exact values. After the loop executes one more time, `j` should be increased by 1.
Output State: **After the if else block executes, the variables `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` maintain their initial values. The updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. `j` has been increased by 1 for the next iteration.**
