Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` added to `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo of the result.**
