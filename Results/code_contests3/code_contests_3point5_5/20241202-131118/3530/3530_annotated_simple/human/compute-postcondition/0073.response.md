Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `MOD`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` remain unchanged. Since `i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated, and the modulo operation is performed using `MOD`, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the sum of the previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 
Output State: **`i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the new value**
