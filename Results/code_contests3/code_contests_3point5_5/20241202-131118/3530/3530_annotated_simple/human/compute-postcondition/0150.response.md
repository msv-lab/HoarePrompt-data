Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `j`, `n`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and the initial values of `dp`, `mask` are maintained. After the execution, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 
Output State: **Updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the previous calculations and initial values of other variables are maintained.**
