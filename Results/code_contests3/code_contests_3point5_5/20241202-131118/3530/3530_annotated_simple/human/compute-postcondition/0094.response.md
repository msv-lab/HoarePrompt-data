Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `i`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, and `j` maintain their initial values. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by incrementing it with the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Furthermore, `j` is increased by 1 for the next iteration, and `dp[i][mask]` is calculated modulo `MOD`.***
