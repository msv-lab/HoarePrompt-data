According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. 
Before the loop starts, `i` is `n + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Also, since the loop variable is `j`, it needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
