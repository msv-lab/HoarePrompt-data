Output State: **`i` is 2, `dp` has been fully updated with the modulo operation using `MOD`, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, for the loop to execute `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. The loop iterates through each element `j` in the range of n, checks if the corresponding element in `a[i - 1]` is 1 and if the `j-th` bit in `mask` is set to 1. If both conditions are true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.**
