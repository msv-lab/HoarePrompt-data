According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `mask`, `i`, `j`, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j`. If this condition is satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` is updated as specified in the description. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` needs to be met. 

So, for the next iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **After the if statement executes, `i` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated, `N` is a positive integer, values of `a_{i,j}` are either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list of length n filled with lists of integers, `_` is n, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 1.**
