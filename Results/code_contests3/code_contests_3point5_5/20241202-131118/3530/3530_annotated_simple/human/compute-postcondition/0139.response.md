Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `dp`, `N`, `a_{i,j}`, `MOD`, `a`, `_` maintain their initial values, `mask` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
