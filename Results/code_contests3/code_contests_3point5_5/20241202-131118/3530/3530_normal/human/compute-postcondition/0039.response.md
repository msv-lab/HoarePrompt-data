Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1. `i` and `j` are both integers. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and the j-th bit in `mask` is set to 1, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], followed by taking modulo MOD to prevent overflow.***
