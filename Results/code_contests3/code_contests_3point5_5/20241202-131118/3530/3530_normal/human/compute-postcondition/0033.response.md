Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, `i` is n+1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1. The final state of dp will have all values updated according to the conditions inside the loop for all valid iterations.**
