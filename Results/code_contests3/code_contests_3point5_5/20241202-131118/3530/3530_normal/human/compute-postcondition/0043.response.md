Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `i` and `j` are both integers. For each dp[i][mask], if a[i - 1][j] is 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated to dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.***
