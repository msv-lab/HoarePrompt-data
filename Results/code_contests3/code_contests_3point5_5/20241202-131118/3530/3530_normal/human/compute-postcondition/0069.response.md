Output State: MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, i is the next integer value after the last processed value in the loop, for the loop to execute mask ranges from 1 to (1 << n) - 1. The element at position (i, mask) in dp is updated by adding the value of element at position (i-1, mask ^ 1 << j) in dp.
