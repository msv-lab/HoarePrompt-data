Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and performing modulo operation with MOD. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, and dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and performing modulo operation.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, and dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and performing modulo operation**
