Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is 0, j is 1.
