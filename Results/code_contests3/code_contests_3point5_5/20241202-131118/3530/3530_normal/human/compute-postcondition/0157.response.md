Output State: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, and `j` is 0. The values of `dp[i][mask]` have been updated for all valid conditions in the loop and taken modulo MOD for all iterations of the loop.
