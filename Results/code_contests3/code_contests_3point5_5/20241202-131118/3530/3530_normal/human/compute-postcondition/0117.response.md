Example Answer:
The code snippet `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. Since `MOD` is fixed, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be recalculated based on this modulo operation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, and the updated values of dp[i][mask] after taking modulo with MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, and the updated values of dp[i][mask] after taking modulo with MOD**
