Example Answer:
The code snippet performs modular division on `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. This ensures that the result remains within the range of `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1 and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1 and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
