Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is 0, `j` is 2. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then the program will update the state accordingly.***
