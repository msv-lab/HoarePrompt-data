Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. After the if-else block executes, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is increased by 1**
