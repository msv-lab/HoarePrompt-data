Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then it is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `MOD`, `n`, and the initial state of `dp` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD**
