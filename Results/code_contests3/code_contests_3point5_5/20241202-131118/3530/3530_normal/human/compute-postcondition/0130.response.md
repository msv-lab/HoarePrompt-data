Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` must be less than (1 << n). Additionally, in the loop, if (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) holds true***
