Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. The values in the dp array have been updated for all iterations of `i`, `mask`, and `j` based on the conditions in the loop code.**
