According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `n` holds the input value. Since `_` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again `_` needs to be 1 less than `n`.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value, `a` is a list containing the mapped integer values from the input split, `_` is 1 less than `n` for the loop to execute a second time**
