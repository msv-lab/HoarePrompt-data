Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is n-1. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the jth bit set to 1.**
