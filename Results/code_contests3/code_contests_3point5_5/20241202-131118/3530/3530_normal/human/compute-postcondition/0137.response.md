Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is 0, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` with 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then the program updates the state accordingly based on these conditions.***
