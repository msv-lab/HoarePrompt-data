Example Answer:
Since `a` is assigned an empty list, the value of `MOD` and `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value, `a` is an empty list.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value, `a` is an empty list**
