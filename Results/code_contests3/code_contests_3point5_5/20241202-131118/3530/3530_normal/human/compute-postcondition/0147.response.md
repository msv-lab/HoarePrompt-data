Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the jth bit set to 1. Then dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. Since the initial state is not provided for i and mask, we can only infer that dp[i][mask] will be updated accordingly based on the previous values of dp and mask, and then taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **dp[i][mask] is updated and taken modulo MOD**
