Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `MOD` is 1000000007, and `n` now holds the input value. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value**
