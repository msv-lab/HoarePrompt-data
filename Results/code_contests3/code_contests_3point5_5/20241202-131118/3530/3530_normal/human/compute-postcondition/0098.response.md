Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is at a value less than (1 << n), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute. The value at a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1.***
