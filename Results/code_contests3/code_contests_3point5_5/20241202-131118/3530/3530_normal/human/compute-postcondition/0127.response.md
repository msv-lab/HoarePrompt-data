Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of dp[i][mask] have been updated based on the conditions a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, and then taken modulo MOD.**
