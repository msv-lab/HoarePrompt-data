Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD**
