Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since `dp[0]` is all 1s, and `mask` is at a value less than `(1 << n)`, the specific value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is added to `dp[i][mask]`. The value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is at a value less than (1 << n), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute, the value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is at a value less than (1 << n), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute, the value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1**
