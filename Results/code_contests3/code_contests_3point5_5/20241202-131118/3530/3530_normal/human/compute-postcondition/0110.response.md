Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. The values in the dp array are updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations. `mask` can take any value less than (1 << n) after the loop finishes.**
