Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is 0, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then update the values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the affected variables.***
