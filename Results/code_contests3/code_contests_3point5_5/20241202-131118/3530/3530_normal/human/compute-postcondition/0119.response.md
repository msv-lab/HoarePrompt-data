According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, for the loop to execute again `j` should be less than `n+1`**
