Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated and taken modulo MOD.***
