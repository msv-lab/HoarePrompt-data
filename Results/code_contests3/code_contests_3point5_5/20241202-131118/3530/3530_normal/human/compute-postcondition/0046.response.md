Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and finding the remainder after dividing by MOD. Since `MOD` is 1000000007, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `i` and `j` are both integers.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `i` and `j` are both integers**
