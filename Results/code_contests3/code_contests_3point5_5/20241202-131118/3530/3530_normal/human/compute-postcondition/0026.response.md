Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time if a[i][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].**
