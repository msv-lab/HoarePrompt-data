Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `^` is the bitwise XOR operator. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not specified in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The output state will be updated based on the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the affected variables.
Output State: **updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the affected variables**
