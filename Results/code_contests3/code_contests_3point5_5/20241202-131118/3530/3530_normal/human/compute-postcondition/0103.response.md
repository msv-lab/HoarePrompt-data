The value at dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value at dp[i-1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and dp array are specified. After execution, the output state will be the updated dp array with the new value at dp[i][mask].
Output State: **Updated dp array after executing the code**
