Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, mask is at the maximum value (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1. The loop has fully executed, and dp has been updated based on the conditions in the loop code for all possible values of `j`.**
