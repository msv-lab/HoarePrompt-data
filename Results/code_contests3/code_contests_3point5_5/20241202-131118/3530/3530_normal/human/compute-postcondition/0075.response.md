Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, i is the next integer value after the last processed value in the loop, for the loop to execute mask ranges from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is less than n-1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated as dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.***
