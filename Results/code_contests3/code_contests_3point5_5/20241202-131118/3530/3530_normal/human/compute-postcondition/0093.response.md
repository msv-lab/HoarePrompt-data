Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value. This operation does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is updated based on conditions, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is updated based on conditions, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD**
