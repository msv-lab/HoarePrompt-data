Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is 1, dp is updated based on conditions, mask is incremented to the next value in the range 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD***
