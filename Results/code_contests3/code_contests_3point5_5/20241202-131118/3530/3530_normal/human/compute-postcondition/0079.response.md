Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. i is the next integer value after the last processed value in the loop, for the loop to execute mask ranges from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, j is less than n-1 incremented by 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] has been updated based on the calculation mentioned above.***
