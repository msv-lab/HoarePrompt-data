Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `i` and `j` are both integers. The loop updates dp[i][mask] based on the conditions specified in the loop code for all valid values of i and mask.**
