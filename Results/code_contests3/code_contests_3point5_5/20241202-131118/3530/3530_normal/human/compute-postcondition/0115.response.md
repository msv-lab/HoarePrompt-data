Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. For the loop to execute, `mask` ranges from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` ranges from 0 to (n-1). In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of `mask` is set to 1***
