Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, a contains mapped integer values, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, i and j are both integers, mask is increased by 1 and less than (1 << n), for the loop to execute the second time j is 2, if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has 1 shifted left by j positions, then dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. Additionally, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD.***
