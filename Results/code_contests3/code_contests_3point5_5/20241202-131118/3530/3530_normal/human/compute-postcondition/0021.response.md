Postcondition: ***MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. In addition,  a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j***
