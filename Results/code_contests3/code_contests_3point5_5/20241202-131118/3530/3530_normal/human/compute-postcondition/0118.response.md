Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s. After the if else block, the updated values of dp[i][mask] after taking modulo with MOD based on the conditions a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j are determined.***
