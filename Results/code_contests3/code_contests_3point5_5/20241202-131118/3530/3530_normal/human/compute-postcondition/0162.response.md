Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, then reads a 2D matrix `a` of size n x n. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and fills it based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints a specific value from the `dp` array. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
