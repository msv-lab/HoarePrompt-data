According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` which means `j` should be less than n-1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1**
