Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute the first time. The element at index (i-1, j) in `a` is 1 and the j-th bit in `mask` is set to 1. The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].**
