According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and it should be less than `1 << n`.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` contains mapped integer values, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) initialized with 0s, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1**
