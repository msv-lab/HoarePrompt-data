According to the code, the loop executes for `n` iterations where `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s**
