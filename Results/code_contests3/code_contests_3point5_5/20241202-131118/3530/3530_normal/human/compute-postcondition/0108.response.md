Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is at a value less than (1 << n), `j` is 2, the value at dp[i - 1][j] is 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] %= MOD**.
