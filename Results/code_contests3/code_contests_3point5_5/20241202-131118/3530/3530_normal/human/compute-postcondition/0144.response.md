According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n-1`.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, `mask` is (1 << n) - 1, `j` is n-1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than (1 << n) - 1**
