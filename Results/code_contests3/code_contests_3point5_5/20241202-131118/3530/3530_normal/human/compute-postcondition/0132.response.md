Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder after dividing by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the affected variables.
Output State: **updated values of `dp[i][mask]` based on the result of the bitwise XOR operation and the affected variables**
