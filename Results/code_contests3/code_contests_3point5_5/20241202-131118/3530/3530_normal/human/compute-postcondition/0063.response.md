Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, a contains mapped integer values, dp is a 2D list of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where dp[0] is all 1s, i and j are both integers, mask is increased by 1 and less than (1 << n), dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and taking modulo MOD for all valid j and mask values.**
