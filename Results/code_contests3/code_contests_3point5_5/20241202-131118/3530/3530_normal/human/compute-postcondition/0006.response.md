Example Answer: 
The `map` function is applied to the input split and the resulting integers are appended to list `a`. The variable `_` is calculated as 1 less than `n`. The value of `MOD` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value, `a` is a list containing the mapped integer values from the input split, `_` is 1 less than `n` for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` holds the input value, `a` is a list containing the mapped integer values from the input split, `_` is 1 less than `n` for the loop to execute a second time**
