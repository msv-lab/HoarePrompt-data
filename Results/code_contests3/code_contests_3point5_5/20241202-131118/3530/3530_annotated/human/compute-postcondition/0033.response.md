Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is n. The loop will execute for all values of j from 0 to n-1, updating dp[i][mask] based on the conditions provided in the loop code.**
