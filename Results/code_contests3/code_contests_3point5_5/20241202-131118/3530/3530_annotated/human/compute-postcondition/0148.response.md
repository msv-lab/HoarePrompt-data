Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 0, mask is adjusted to (1 << n) - 1, j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided and taken modulo of MOD for all iterations of the loop. Additionally, dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j.***
