Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit in the binary representation of mask is also 1, then the overall state of the program remains unchanged.***
