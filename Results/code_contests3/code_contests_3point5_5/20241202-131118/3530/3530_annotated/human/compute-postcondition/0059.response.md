According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `j` is increased by 1 so `j` becomes 2 and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is n+2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 2, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
