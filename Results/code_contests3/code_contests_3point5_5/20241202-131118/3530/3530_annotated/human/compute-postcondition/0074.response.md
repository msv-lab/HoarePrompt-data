Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is computed as dp[i][mask] modulo MOD. Since dp[i][mask] is initially set to 1 and MOD is 1000000007, taking the modulo does not alter the value. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 1, j is n, value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, j-th bit of mask is set to 1, and the updated value of dp[i][mask] is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 1, j is n, value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, j-th bit of mask is set to 1, and the updated value of dp[i][mask] is 1**
