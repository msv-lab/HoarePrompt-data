Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 0, mask is 2, j is 0. The element at index (i-1, j) in a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated modulo MOD**
