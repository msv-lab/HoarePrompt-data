Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the first time n is greater than 0, j is 0. The element at index (i-1,j) of a is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left-shifted by j is not equal to 0, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the calculation dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
