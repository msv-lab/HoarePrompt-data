Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a 2D array `a` of size n x n with binary values. It then performs a dynamic programming algorithm to calculate and update values in a 2D list `dp`. Finally, it prints the value at position `(1 << n) - 1` in the last row of `dp`. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on the input provided during execution.**
