Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is less than n for the loop to execute. The value of a at position (i - 1, j) is 1 and the bitwise AND between mask and 1 shifted left by j is not zero.***
