Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 3, mask is 1, for the loop to execute the first time mask starts from 1 and goes up to (1 << n) - 1, j is adjusted from 0 to n-1. In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j is true.***
