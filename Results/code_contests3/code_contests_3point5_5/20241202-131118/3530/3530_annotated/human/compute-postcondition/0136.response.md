Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is still appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 3, mask is updated to include the next value of j that satisfies the condition, j is adjusted from 0 to n, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, mask & 1 << j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided and taken modulo of MOD for the loop to execute one more time. dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] mod MOD.**
