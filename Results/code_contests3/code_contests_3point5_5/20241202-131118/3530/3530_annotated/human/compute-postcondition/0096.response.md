According to the code, the loop can execute again if the mask is less than 2^n. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 2. Since mask is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, mask should be less than 2^n, which means mask should be less than (1 << n).
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3**
