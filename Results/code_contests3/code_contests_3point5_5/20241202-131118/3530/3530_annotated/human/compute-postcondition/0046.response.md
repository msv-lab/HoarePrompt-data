Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, where `MOD` is 1000000007. Therefore, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n+1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the calculation mentioned in the code snippet**
