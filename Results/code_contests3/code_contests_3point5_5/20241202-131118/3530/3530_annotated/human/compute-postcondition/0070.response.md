Output State: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 1, j is n-1 for the loop to execute the first time. The value at a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. After executing the provided code, dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with MOD.
