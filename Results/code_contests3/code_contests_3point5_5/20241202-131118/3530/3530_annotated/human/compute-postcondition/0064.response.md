Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is n-1. The loop will have updated dp[i][mask] for all possible combinations of i, mask, and j based on the conditions provided in the loop code.**
