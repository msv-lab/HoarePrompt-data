Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known and remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
