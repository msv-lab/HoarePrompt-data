Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 0, mask is 2, j is 2. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated based on the calculation formula provided and recalculated modulo MOD.***
