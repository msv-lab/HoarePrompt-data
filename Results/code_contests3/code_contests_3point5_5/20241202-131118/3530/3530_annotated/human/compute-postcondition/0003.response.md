According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007 and `n` is an input value. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
