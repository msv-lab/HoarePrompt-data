Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `i-1` is -1, and the value of `mask` is 2. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to 2 ^ j. Since `dp` is filled with ones, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is 1. So, `dp[i][mask]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 0, mask is 2, for the loop to execute j is 0. The element at index (i-1, j) in a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1.
