According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the second time n is greater than 0, j is 1. Since there are no conditions specified for `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`, the only condition is that j is less than n. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, j should be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the third time n is greater than 0, j is 2**
