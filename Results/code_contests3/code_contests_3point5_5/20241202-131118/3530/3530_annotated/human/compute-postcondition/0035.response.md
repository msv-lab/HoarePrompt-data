According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `n` which means the loop will not execute. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be less than `n`.

State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is n+1, `j` is less than n for the loop to execute**
