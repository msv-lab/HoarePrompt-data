According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n+1**
