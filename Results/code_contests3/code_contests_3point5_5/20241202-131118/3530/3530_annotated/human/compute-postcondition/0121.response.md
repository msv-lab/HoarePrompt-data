Output State: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 3, mask is the next value in the sequence, for the loop to execute one more time j is adjusted from 0 to n-2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask & 1 << j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided where dp[i][mask] will have the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] added to it. dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo of MOD.
