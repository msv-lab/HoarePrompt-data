Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 2. The loop updates the values in dp based on the conditions provided in the loop code for each iteration, calculating and storing the results modulo MOD.**
