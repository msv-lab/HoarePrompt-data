According to the code, the loop can execute again if `mask` is less than 2^n. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1, and n is greater than 0. The next value for `mask` should be 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2**.
