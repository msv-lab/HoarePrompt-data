Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the sum of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking modulo with `MOD`. After this operation, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated according to the result of the modulo operation. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n, dp[i][mask] is updated with the sum of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n, dp[i][mask] is updated with the sum of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
