According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration to start `j` should be 2.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 0, mask is 2, j is 2**
