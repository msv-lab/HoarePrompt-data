According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n-1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` should be less than `n-1` in the next iteration. Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 1, j is n, value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, j-th bit of mask is set to 1.**
