According to the code, the loop will execute for the next iteration if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is n-1. Since the loop starts with i=1, for the loop to execute one more time, i should be 2.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is n-1**
