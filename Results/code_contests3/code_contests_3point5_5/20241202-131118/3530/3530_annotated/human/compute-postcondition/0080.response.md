Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1. All elements in `a` are 1, and for each mask value from 0 to 2^n - 1, `dp[2][mask]` contains the sum of all valid combinations based on the conditions inside the loop.**
