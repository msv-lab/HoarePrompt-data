According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` starts at 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
