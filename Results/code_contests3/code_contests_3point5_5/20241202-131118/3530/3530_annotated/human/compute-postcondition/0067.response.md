For the loop to execute the first time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, `mask` is 1, j is n-1 for the loop to execute the first time**
