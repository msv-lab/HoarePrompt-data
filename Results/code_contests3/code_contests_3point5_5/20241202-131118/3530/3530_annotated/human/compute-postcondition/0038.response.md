Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is less than n for the loop to execute, the value of a at position (i - 1, j) is 1 and the bitwise AND between mask and 1 shifted left by j is not zero. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**.
