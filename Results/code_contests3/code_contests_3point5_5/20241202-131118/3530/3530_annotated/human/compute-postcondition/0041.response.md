Example Answer:
The value at dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of i is 1, mask is n+1, and j is n. This operation modifies the 2D list dp. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 1, mask is n+1, j is n, dp[i][mask] is updated with the sum of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
