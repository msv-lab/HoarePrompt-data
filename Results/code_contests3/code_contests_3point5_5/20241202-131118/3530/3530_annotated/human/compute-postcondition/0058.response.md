Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is n+2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.***
