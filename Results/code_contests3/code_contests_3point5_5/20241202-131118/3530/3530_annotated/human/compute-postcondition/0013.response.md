According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. Since the loop starts from 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be 1 and `dp[0][1]` should be assigned the value 1.
