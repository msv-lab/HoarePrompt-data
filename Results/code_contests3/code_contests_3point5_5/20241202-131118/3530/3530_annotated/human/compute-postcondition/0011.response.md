According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, and `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with zeros. Since the loop starts from 0, the initial state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
