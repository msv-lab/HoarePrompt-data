According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n`**
