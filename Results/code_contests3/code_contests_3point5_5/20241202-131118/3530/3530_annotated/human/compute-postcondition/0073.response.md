Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the specific value at `a[i - 1][j]` are given. After the execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 1, j is n, value at a[i - 1][j] is 1, j-th bit of mask is set to 1, and the updated value of dp[i][mask].
