Example Answer:
`a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for the second time. The value of `n` is greater than 0, and MOD is 1000000007. The previous values of `a` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for the second time.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for the second time**
