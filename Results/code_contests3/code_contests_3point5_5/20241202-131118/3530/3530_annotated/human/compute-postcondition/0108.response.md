Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the third time n is greater than 0, j is 2, the value at dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.**
