According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, so it needs to be adjusted to 0. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as j is less than n, so `j` needs to be adjusted to 0. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 0, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is 0**
