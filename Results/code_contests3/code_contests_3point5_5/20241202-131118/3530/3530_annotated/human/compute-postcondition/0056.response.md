Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `i - 1` is 0. The value of `mask` is `n + 2`, and `j` is 1. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` is calculated as `(n + 2) ^ (1 << 1)`. The previous values of `dp` are all ones. After the calculation, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1, dp[i][mask] is updated**
