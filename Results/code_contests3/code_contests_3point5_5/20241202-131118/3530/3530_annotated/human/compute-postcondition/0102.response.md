According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, j is 0. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the next state should be:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, i is 2, mask is 3, for the loop to execute the second time n is greater than 0, j is 1**
