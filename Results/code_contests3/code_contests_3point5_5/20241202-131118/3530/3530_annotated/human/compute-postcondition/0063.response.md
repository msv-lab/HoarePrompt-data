Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is n+2. The loop will update `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions given in the loop code for all values of `j` from 0 to n-1.**
