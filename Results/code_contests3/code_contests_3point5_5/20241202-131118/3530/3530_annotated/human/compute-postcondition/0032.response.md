Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, `dp` is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, `dp[i][mask]` is modulo divided by `MOD`.***
