Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, a is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for n times, dp is a 2D list with n + 1 rows and 2^n columns filled with ones, `i` is 1, mask is n+2, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, a[i-1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j is true. After executing the code snippet, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].**
