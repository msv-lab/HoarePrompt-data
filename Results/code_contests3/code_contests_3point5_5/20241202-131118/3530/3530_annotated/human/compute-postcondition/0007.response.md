According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007 and `n` is greater than 0. The variable `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than 0.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is appended with the result of mapping integers from input split for the second time**
