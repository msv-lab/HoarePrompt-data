Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by initializing x to 0, iterating through the string S to increment or decrement x based on the character 'I' or 'D' respectively, and finally printing the maximum value taken by x during the operations. The logic implemented in the program ensures that the maximum value is correctly calculated. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
