Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D' characters, i is 2. If S[2] == 'I', the result can be either 3 or 1 for the loop to execute a third time. If S[2] != 'I', the result can be either 2 or 0 for the loop to execute a third time. In the if part, the result is incremented by 1. In the else part, the result is decremented by 1.***
