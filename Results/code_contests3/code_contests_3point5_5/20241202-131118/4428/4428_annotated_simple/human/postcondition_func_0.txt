The function `func` reads a positive integer N and a string S of length N composed of only 'I' and 'D' characters. It then iterates through the string and increments the result by 1 for each 'I' character and decrements by 1 for each 'D' character. If the final result is negative, it is set to 0. Finally, the function prints the resulting value. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but reads input from the user.
