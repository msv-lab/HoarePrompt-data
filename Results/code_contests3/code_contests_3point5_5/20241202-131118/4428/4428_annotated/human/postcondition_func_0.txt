The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` containing only 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, it returns the positive difference. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, it returns the negative difference. If the counts are equal, it returns 0. If the calculated result is negative, it sets the result to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the final result.
