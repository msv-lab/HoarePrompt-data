Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` containing only 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string, which represents the maximum value taken by `x` during the operations. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, it returns the positive difference. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, it returns the negative difference. If the counts are equal, it returns 0. The program also handles the case where the calculated result is negative by setting the result to 0. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
