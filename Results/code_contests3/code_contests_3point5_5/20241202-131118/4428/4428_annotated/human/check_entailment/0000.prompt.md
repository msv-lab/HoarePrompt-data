You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have an integer variable x. Initially, x=0.

Some person gave you a string S of length N, and using the string you performed the following operation N times. In the i-th operation, you incremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`I`, and decremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`D`.

Find the maximum value taken by x during the operations (including before the first operation, and after the last operation).

Constraints

* 1≤N≤100
* |S|=N
* No characters except `I` and `D` occur in S.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the maximum value taken by x during the operations.

Examples

Input

5
IIDID


Output

2


Input

7
DDIDDII


Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'.
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    S = raw_input()
    result = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'I':
            result += 1
        else:
            result -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'. If there are more 'I's than 'D's in the string S, result is the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are more 'D's than 'I's in the string S, result is the negative difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are an equal number of 'I's and 'D's, result is 0.
    if (result < 0) :
        result = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, the result is the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, the result is the negative difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are an equal number of 'I's and 'D's, the result is 0. If the result is less than 0, the function does not have an else part.
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` containing only 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, it returns the positive difference. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, it returns the negative difference. If the counts are equal, it returns 0. If the calculated result is negative, it sets the result to 0. The function does not accept any parameters and prints the final result.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
