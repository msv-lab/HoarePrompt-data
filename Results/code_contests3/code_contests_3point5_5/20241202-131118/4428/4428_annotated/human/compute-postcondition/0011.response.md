Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 1, so after execution, `result` becomes 0. The value of `i` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', result is 0, i is 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', result is 0, i is 1**
