Example Answer:
The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but after execution, `result` will be increased by 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', i is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, result is incremented by 1**
