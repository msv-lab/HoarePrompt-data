Example Answer:
The variable `result` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'; result is 0.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'; result is 0**
