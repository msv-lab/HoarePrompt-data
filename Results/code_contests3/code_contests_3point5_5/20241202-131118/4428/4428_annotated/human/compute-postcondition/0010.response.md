Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 1, so after execution, `result` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', result is 2 if the character at index i in string S is 'I', otherwise result is -1, i is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D', result is 2 if the character at index i in string S is 'I', otherwise result is -1, i is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
