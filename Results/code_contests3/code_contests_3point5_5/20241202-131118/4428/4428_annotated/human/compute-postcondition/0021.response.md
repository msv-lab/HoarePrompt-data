Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, S is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, the result is the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, the result is the negative difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are an equal number of 'I's and 'D's, the result is 0. If the result is less than 0, the function does not have an else part.**
