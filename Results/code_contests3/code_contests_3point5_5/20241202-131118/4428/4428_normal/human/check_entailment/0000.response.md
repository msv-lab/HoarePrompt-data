Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer N and a string S as input, then iterates through the string counting occurrences of 'I' and other characters. It calculates the difference between the counts and prints the result. If the result is negative, it sets it to 0 before printing. The code follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases. The maximum value taken by x during the operations is correctly calculated and returned. The code does what is expected and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
