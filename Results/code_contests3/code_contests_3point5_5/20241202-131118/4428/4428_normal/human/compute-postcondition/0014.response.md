Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` can be 2, 0, 1, or -1. Therefore, the new value of `result` can be 3, 1, 2, or 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`result` can be either 3, 1, 2, or 0, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S` is a list of characters**
