Since the loop depends on the variables `i` and `N`, we need to adjust the state before the loop starts to ensure that the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `result` being 0 does not guarantee that the loop will execute. In order for the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0 at the start.
State: **`result` is 0, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
