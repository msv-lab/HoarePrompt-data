Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in, considering the constraints on the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section. The program iterates through the nuts, adjusting the number of divisors and nuts accordingly to determine the minimum number of boxes needed. The provided examples also match the expected output based on the problem description.
