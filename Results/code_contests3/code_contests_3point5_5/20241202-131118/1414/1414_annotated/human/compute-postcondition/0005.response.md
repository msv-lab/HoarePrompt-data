Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v` from its previous value. Since `k` and `v` are integers between 2 and 1000, and `a` was initially between 1 and 1000, the new value of `a` will also fall within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`; `res` is 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`; `res` is 1**
