Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0. After execution, `res` becomes 1. Therefore, the Output State is: k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; res is 1.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; res is 1**
