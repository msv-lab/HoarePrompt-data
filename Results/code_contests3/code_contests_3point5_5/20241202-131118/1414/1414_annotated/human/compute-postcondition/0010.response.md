Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers in the specified ranges; `res` is 1, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers in the specified ranges; `res` is 1, `b` is 0**
