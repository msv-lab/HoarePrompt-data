Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0, `b` is 0**
