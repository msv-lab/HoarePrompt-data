Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0. If b ≥ k, `a` is updated to a - k * v and `b` is decreased by k - 1. If b < k, `a` is updated to a - (b + 1) * v and if b is not greater than 0, `a` remains greater than 0.***
