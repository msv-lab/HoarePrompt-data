Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `a - k * v`. If `b` is less than `k`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `res` is incremented by 1 and if `b` is greater than 0, then `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
