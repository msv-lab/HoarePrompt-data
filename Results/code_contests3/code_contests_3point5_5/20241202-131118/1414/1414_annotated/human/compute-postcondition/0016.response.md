Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1, so the value of `res` increases by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0**
