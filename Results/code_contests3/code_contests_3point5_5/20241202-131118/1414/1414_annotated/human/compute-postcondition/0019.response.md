Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from it. The values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0**
