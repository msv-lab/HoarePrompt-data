Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. As `k` remains unchanged, `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1` from its previous value. The values of `k`, `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `a - k * v`; `res` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `a - k * v`; `res` is incremented by 1**
