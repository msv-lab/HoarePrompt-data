Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values and then iterates a loop to distribute the nuts into boxes according to the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of boxes needed to distribute all the nuts while ensuring that each box does not have more than `k` sections and each section does not have more than `v` nuts. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
