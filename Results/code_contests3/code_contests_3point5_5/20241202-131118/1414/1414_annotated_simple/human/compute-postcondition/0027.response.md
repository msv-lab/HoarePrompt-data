Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. The previous value of `b` is unknown but `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `b` is updated, `v` remain unchanged, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is updated to the value of `a - k * v`.
Output State: **`k`, `b` is updated, `v` remain unchanged, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is updated to the value of `a - k * v`**
