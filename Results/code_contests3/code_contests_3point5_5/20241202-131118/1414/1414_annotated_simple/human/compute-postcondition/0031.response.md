Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers within the specified range. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute again.***
