Example Answer:
`k, a, b, v` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `k, a, b, v`. Therefore, the output state is: `k, a, b, v` are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **`k, a, b, v` are integers within the specified range**
