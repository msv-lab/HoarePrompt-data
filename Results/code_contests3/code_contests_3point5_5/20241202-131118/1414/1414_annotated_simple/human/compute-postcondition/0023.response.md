Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers within the specified range, `res` is 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `a` is greater than 0. If b >= k, after running the code, `a` is updated to its previous value minus the product of `k` and `v`. `b` is updated to its previous value minus an unknown integer value. If b > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` becomes 0. If b <= 0, then `a` is decremented by `v`.***
