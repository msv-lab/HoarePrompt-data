Postcondition: ***`k, a, b, v, res` are integers within the specified range. `res` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `a` is greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by the product of `k` and `v`. If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation: `a = a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is now 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decremented by `v`.***
