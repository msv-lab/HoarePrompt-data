Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the affected variables are: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers within the specified range and `res` is increased by 1. Since `b` is updated to 0, the loop condition `b must be greater or equal to k` is not satisfied. The value of `a` remains the same as it is not updated in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers within the specified range, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is not updated.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers within the specified range, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is not updated**
