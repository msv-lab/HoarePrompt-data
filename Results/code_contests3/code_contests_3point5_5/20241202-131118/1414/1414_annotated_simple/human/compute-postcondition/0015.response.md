According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is 1 and `a` is greater than 0. No other variables were mentioned to have specific conditions for the loop execution. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`k, a, b, v, res` are integers within the specified range. `res` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `a` is greater than 0**
