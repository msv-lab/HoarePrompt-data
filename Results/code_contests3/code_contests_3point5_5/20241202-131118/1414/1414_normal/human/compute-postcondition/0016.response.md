Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k, a, b, and v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k, a, b, and v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2**
