According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is greater than 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; res is 1**.
