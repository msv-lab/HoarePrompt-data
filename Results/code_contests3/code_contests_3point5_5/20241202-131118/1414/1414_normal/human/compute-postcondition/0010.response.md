Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `b` is unknown, so the output state is: k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; res is 1. b is less than k. b is greater than 0, a is updated according to the formula.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; res is 1. b is less than k. b is greater than 0, a is updated according to the formula**
