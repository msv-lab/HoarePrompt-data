Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1. If b >= k, the state remains the same as the precondition. If b < k and b > 0, `k`, `a` are between 1 and 999, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1. If b = 0, `k`, `a` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000; `b`, `v` are integers such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1.***
