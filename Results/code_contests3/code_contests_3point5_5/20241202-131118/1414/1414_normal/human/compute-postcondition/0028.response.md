Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from it. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are known but the previous value of `res` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1**
