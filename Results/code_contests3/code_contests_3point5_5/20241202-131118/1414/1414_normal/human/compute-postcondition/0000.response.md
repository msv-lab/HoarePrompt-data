Example Answer:
k, a, b, and v are assigned values based on the input split by spaces. The values of k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000**
