Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The value of `b` is now 0. The other variables are not affected, so the Output State is: `k, a, b, and v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the previous value of `a`, `b`, and `v`, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`k, a, b, and v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the previous value of `a`, `b`, and `v`, `b` is 0**
