Postcondition: ***`k, a, b, and v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2. If b is greater than 0, `a` is updated based on the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v`, and `b` is set to 0. If b is not greater than 0, `a` remains the same and `b` is set to 0.***
