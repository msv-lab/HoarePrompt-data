Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1. If b > 0, the state remains the same as the precondition. If b = 0, `k`, `a` are between 1 and 999, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1.***
