Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is decremented by `v`. The previous value of `a` is unknown so after execution, `a` is now `a - v`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a is a - v, b is less than k, b is less than or equal to 0, res is 1.
Output State: **a is a - v, b is less than k, b is less than or equal to 0, res is 1**
