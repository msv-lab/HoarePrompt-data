Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for k, a, b, and v. It then iterates a loop based on the value of a and updates a, b, and res accordingly. The loop terminates when a becomes non-positive. The function prints the final value of res, which represents the number of iterations executed by the loop. The loop logic involves decrementing a based on conditions related to k, b, and v. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the output is based solely on the input values provided during execution.**
