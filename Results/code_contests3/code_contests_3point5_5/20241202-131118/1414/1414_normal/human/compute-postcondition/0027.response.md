Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`. Since `k` is between 2 and 1000 inclusive, `b` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 999, 0 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1**
