Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in boxes based on the constraints provided in the problem description. It iterates through the process of distributing nuts into boxes while considering the maximum number of sections allowed in a box and the number of divisors available. The logic of the program aligns with the problem statement, ensuring that all nuts are distributed efficiently. Additionally, the program handles different scenarios such as when the number of divisors is greater than or equal to the maximum allowed sections in a box, and when there is only one divisor available. There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
