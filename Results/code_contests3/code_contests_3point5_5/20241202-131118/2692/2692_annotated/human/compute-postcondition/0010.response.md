Functionality: **The function `func` reads an even integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50 from the user input. It then reads a ticket number as a list of integers of length `n`. The function calculates the sum of the first half of the digits and compares it with the sum of the second half (or the sum of the second half plus the last digit if `n` is odd). If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and it appears incomplete as it lacks a return statement.**
