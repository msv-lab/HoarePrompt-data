Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, the ticket number is an integer of length n, digits is assigned the map object resulting from converting the input using raw_input().strip() to integers. If the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits (or the sum of the second half plus the last digit if n is odd), 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, the sum of the first half of the digits is not equal to the sum of the second half of the digits.***
