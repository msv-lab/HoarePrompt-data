Correctness: **True**

The program reads an even integer `n` and a ticket number as a list of integers of length `n`. It then calculates the sum of the first half of the digits and compares it with the sum of the second half (or the sum of the second half plus the last digit if `n` is odd). If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This matches the problem description exactly, making the program correct.
