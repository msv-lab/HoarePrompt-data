Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the requirement that the ticket number should be a lucky number (contains only the digits 4 and 7). The program only checks if the sum of digits in the first half equals the sum of digits in the second half, but it does not verify if the ticket number is a lucky number or not.

For example, if the ticket number is "1234", the program would incorrectly output "YES" because the sum of digits in the first half (1+2) equals the sum of digits in the second half (3+4), even though the ticket number is not a lucky number.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description and is incorrect.
