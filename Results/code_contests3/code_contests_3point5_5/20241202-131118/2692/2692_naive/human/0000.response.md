Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the ticket number is lucky by comparing the sum of digits in the first half with the sum of digits in the second half. The condition `sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])` accurately determines if the ticket number is lucky or not. Additionally, the program handles the input as specified in the problem description. Since all potential cases have been considered and the logic is implemented correctly, the program is correct.
