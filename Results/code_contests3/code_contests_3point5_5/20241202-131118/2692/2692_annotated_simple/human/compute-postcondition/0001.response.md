Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the integer input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The value of `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**
