Functionality: **The function `func` reads an even integer `n` from the input within the range 2 to 50, followed by a list of integers of length `n`. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the list is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The exact task performed based on the sum equality is not specified in the given information.**
