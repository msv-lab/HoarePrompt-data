Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console. It does not affect any variables in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive even integer, ticket number is a positive integer of length n, digits is a map object containing integer values of the input after stripping whitespaces. 
Output State: **n is a positive even integer, ticket number is a positive integer of length n, digits is a map object containing integer values of the input after stripping whitespaces.**
