Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` representing the length of a ticket number and a sequence of integers as the ticket number. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits of the ticket number is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
