The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` representing the length of a ticket number and a sequence of integers as the ticket number. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits of the ticket number is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
