Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the function `func_1` returns `True` if the string `ch` does not contain any vowels (a, e, i, o, u); otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the code does not handle the case when a block of consonants has all letters the same, which should not be considered a typo according to the problem description. For example, if the input word is "back", the code will output "b a c k" which is incorrect. This case is not handled by the current implementation, making the code incorrect.
