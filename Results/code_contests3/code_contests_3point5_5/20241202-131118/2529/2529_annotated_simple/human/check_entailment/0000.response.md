Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

1. The program reads the input as floating-point numbers, but the problem description specifies that the input will be arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c.
2. The program counts the occurrences of each floating-point number in the input list, but it should be counting the number of ships ending up at the same coordinate.
3. The program does not correctly parse the arithmetic expressions to extract the coordinates.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
