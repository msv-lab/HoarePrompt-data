The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes the input consisting of m ships, where m is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 200,000. Each ship's jump coordinate is provided as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function does not return any specific output; it processes the input ships' jump coordinates according to the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function processes the jump coordinates of m ships, where m is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, with each ship's jump coordinate being in the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits.**
