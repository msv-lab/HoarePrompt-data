Example Answer:
`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a floating-point number**
