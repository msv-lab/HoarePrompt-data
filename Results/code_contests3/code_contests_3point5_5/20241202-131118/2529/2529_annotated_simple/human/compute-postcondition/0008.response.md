According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `test_list` is a list containing the new floating-point number `e`, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `m` should still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` is a list containing the new floating-point number `e`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute another time `m` must be greater than 2**
