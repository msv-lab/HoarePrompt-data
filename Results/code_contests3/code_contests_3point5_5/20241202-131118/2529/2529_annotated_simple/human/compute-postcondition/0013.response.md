According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, my_list is still empty. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the test_list.
State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, for the loop to execute the first time test_list is a list containing `m` floating-point numbers input by the user with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in test_list, my_list is an empty list**
