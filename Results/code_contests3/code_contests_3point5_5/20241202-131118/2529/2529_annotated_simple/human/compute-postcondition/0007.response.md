Example Answer:
A new floating-point number `e` is appended to the list `test_list`. The value of `i` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `test_list` is a list containing the new floating-point number `e`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` is a list containing the new floating-point number `e`, `i` is 1**
