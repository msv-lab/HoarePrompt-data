According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `i`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is a list containing the floating-point number `e`, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must be greater than 1 and `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` is a list containing the floating-point number `e`, `i` is 1**
