Example Answer:
The code appends the count of occurrences of the first element `i` in the `test_list` to `my_list`. Since `test_list` contains at least 1 element and `i` is the first element, the count of `i` in `test_list` will be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is a list containing `m` floating-point numbers input by the user, `i` is the first element in `test_list`, `my_list` is a list containing the count of `i` in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is a list containing `m` floating-point numbers input by the user, `i` is the first element in `test_list`, `my_list` is a list containing the count of `i` in `test_list`**
