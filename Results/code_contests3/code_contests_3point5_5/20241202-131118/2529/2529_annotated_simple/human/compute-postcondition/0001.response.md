Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `test_list`. Since `test_list` is empty, it does not have any impact on the value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list**
