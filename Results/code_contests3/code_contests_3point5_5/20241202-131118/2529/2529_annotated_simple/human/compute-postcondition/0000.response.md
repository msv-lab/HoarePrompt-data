Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000**
