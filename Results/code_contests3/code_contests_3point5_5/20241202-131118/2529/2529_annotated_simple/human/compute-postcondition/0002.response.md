According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `m` is at least 1. Since `test_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
