According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than 1**
