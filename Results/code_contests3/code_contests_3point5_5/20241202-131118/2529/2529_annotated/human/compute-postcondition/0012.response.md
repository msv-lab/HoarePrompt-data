Example Answer:
An empty list `my_list` is created. The initial state indicates that `m` is greater than 0 and `test_list` contains `m` elements, each equal to a floating-point number entered as input. Since `my_list` is empty, the program does not affect the values of `m` or `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` elements each equal to a floating-point number entered as input, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` elements each equal to a floating-point number entered as input, `my_list` is an empty list**
