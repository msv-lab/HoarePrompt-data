Example Answer:
`e` is appended to `test_list`. Since `test_list` already contains `e`, after execution, `test_list` will have two `e` elements. The value of `m` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two `e` elements.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains two `e` elements**
