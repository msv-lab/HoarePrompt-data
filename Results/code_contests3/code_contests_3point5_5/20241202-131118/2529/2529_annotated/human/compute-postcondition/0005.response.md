According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `e` is an input floating-point number. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must still be greater than 0 and nothing else needs to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `e`, `e` is an input floating-point number**
