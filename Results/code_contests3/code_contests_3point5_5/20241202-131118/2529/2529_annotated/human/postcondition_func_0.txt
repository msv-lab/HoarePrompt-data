The function `func` reads an integer `m` from the user, then reads `m` floating-point numbers and stores them in a list `test_list`. It then counts the occurrences of each unique element in `test_list` and prints the counts separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the counts of unique elements in the input list.
