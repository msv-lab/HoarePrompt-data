The function reads an integer `m` from the user, then reads `m` floating-point numbers to create a list `test_list`. It then iterates over `test_list` to count the occurrences of each unique element and store them in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each unique element in `test_list` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and simply executes the described process.
