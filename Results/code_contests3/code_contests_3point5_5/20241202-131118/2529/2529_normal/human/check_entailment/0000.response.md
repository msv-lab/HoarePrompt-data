Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is reading floating-point numbers as input, while the problem description specifies that the input should be in the form of arithmetic expressions like (a+b)/c. Since the code does not handle the input format specified in the problem description, it is incorrect.
