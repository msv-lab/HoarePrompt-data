Example Answer:
`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `m` and `test_list` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `my_list` is an empty list**
