According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `e` is an input floating-point number, and `i` is less than `m`. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `m+1`. Additionally, `e` should be appended to `test_list`.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `e` is an input floating-point number, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `m+1, `test_list` has `e` appended to it**
