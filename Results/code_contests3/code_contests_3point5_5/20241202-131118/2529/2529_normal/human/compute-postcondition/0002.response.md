Since the loop will execute based on the value of `m`, which is an input integer, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `test_list` is an empty list, so it does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
