The code snippet appends the count of the third element in `test_list` to `my_list`. Since the count of the third element in `test_list` is 2, after execution, `my_list` will contain the values [2, 2]. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, `my_list` contains the values [2, 2], `i` is the third element in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, `my_list` contains the values [2, 2], `i` is the third element in `test_list**
