Example Answer:
`e` is appended to `test_list`, which is an empty list. Therefore, after execution, `test_list` will contain the value of `e`. The value of `m` and the fact that `e` is a floating-point number do not change. 
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `e` is an input floating-point number**
