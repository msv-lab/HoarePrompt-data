Example Answer:
The floating-point number `e` is appended to the `test_list`. Since `e` is an input floating-point number, it gets added to the `test_list`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is less than `m+1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e` and the value of `i` is less than `m+1.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `i` is less than `m+1**.
