Example Answer:
The `print` function joins all elements of `my_list` into a string with a space in between each element. The elements of `my_list` are the count of each unique element in `test_list`. The variable `i` is the last element in `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` elements, `my_list` contains the count of each unique element in `test_list`, `i` is the last element in `test_list`, and the count of each unique element in `test_list` is printed with spaces between them.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` elements, `my_list` contains the count of each unique element in `test_list`, `i` is the last element in `test_list`, and the count of each unique element in `test_list` is printed with spaces between them**
