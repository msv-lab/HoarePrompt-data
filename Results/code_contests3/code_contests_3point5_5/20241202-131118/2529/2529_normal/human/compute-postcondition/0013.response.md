According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start, `m` is greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `my_list` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `test_list` must contain at least 1 element, and `i` should be the first element in `test_list`.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains at least 1 element, `my_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
