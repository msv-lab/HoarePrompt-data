Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time each trolleybus can reach the final station based on the provided formula in the problem description. It iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time using the given formula, and updates the maximum time required for all trolleybuses. The program then prints the time for each trolleybus in the order given in the input. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the expected output, it is correct.
