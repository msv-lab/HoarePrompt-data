Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station. Then, for each trolleybus, it calculates the minimum time it takes to reach the final station based on the provided formula. It updates the maximum time value throughout all iterations and prints the maximum time calculated for each trolleybus.

The program ensures that trolleybuses do not overtake each other and that they arrive at the final station as quickly as possible. It correctly calculates the time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on their maximum speed and acceleration. The program handles the special case where a trolleybus catches up with another one and they travel together until the final station.
