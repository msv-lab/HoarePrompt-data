Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values based on user input using `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values based on user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values based on user input**
