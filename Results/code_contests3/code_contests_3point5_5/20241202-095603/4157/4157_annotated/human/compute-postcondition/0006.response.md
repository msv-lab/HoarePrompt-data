Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `t`, and no other variables are affected in this scenario. The value of `t` depends on the comparison of `t1 + ti` and its current value, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state is simply the value of `t` being printed.
Output State: **The value of `t` is printed**
