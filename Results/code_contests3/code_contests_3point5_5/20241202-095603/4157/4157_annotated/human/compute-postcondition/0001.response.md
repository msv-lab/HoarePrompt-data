Example Answer:
The values for `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping the integer values obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are dependent on the input given, so the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values based on user input**
