Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of `t` that was updated earlier in the program. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to a new value and printed, `i` needs to be incremented and less than `n`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input split by space.
Output State: **`t` is updated to a new value and printed, `i` needs to be incremented and less than `n`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input split by space**
