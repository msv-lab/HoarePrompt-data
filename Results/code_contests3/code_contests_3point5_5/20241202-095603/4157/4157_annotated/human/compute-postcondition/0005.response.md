Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `t1` and `ti` are calculated based on user input, while the current value of `t` is 0.0. The output state will depend on the comparison between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. 
Output State: **Depends on the comparison of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
