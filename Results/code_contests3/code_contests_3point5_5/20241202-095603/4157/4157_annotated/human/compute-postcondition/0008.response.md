Example Answer:
`ti, v` is assigned the values returned by mapping the input values to float after splitting them. The values of `ti` and `v` will depend on the input provided. The value of `t` is printed, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `t` is printed, the values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on user input, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The value of `t` is printed, the values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on user input, and `i` is incremented by 1**
