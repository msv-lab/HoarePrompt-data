Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. Otherwise, `t1` is calculated as the square root of `2 * d / a`. The variables `v`, `a`, `d` are involved in the calculations. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to a new value and printed, `i` needs to be incremented and less than `n`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input split by space.
Output State: **`t` is updated to a new value and printed, `i` needs to be incremented and less than `n`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input split by space**
