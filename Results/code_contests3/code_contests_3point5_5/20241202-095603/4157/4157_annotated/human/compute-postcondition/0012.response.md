According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated to a new value and that value is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than `n`.
State: **`t` is updated to a new value and that value is printed, for the loop to execute another time `i` needs to be incremented and less than `n`**
