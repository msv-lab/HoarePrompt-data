Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated using the first expression, otherwise it is calculated using the second expression which involves `math.sqrt()`. The values of `v`, `a`, and `d` are taken from user input. The output state is: 
Output State: **The value of `t` is printed, `t1` is calculated based on user inputs for `v`, `a`, and `d`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
