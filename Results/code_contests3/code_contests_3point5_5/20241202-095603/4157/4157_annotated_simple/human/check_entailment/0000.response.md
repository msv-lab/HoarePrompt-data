Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given constraints. It considers the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance to calculate the arrival time for each trolleybus. The program iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time it takes to reach the final station, and updates the overall maximum time. The output of the program is the arrival time for each trolleybus in the order they are given in the input, which matches the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
