Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from mapping the input values after splitting them. As the initial state does not provide any input values, the output state will be: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from user input**
