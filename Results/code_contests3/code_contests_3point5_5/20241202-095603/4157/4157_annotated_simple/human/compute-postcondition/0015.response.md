Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `t1`, `ti`, and `v` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `t` is updated to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **the value of `t` is updated to the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
