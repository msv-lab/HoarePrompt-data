According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `t` was printed. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.
State: **Printing the value of `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**
