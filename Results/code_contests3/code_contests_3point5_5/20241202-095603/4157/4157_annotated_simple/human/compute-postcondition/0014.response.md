Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional statement. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If the condition is not met, then `t1` is calculated as the square root of `(2 * d / a)`. The previous values of `t`, `ti`, and `v` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float, and `t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement.
Output State: **the value of `t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float, and `t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement**
