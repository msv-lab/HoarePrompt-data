According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `t` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **the value of `t` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1**
