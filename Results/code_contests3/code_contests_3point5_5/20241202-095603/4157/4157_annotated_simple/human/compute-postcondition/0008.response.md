Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to float. The variables `t`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `n` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `n` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**
