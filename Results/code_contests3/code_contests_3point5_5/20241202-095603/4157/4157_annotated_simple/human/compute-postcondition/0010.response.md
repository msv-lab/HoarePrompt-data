Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The value of `t1` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, while `i` is increased by 1 if the loop executes again and `n` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`, `i` is increased by 1 if the loop executes again, `n` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**
