Example Answer:
The variables `ti` and `v` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The function `map(float, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it, converts each element to a float, and then assigns them to `ti` and `v`. The value of `t` is not affected, and `i` is not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: the value of `t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **the value of `t` is printed, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
