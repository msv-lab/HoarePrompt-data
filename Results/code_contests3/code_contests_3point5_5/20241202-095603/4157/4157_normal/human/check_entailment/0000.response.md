Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. It calculates the minimum time required for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given conditions, but it does not consider the constraint that trolleybuses cannot overtake each other. This means that the code does not handle the scenario where a trolleybus catches up with another one and they travel together to the final station. Additionally, the code is missing an import statement for the math module, specifically for the sqrt function, which may cause an error when trying to use it.

Thus, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all cases as specified in the problem description.
