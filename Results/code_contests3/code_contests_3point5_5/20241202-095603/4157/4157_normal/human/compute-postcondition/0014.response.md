Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value of the conditional expression `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, otherwise it is assigned the square root of `2 * d / a`. The values of `v`, `a`, and `d` are assigned float values from input, `t` is printed, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input, and `t1` is assigned a float value based on the given conditional expression.
Output State: **`t` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input, `t1` is assigned a float value based on the given conditional expression**
