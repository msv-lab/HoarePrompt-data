According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will run. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0. 
State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer inputs, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
