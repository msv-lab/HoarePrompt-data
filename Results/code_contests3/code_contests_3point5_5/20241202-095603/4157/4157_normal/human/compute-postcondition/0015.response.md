Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `ti` and `t1` are unknown, so the new value of `t` will depend on their values. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value of (t1 + ti) and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input, `t1` is assigned a float value based on the given conditional expression.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value of (t1 + ti) and the current value of `t`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input, `t1` is assigned a float value based on the given conditional expression**
