Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values of the float conversions of inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The previous values of `ti` and `v` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input.
Output State: **`t` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input**
