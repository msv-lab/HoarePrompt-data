Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values of float numbers obtained by splitting the input values. The values of `ti` and `v` are determined by the input provided during execution. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value; `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values based on the input.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value; `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values based on the input**
