Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping integer inputs obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the input values, the output state after executing this code is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer inputs from user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer inputs from user input**
