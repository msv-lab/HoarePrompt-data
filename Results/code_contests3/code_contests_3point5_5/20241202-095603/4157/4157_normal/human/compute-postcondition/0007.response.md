According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value. So for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value, and `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
