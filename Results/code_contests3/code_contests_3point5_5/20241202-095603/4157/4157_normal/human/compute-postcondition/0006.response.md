Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `t`. The value of `t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value, but the initial value of `t` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum value between the calculated value and the current value**
