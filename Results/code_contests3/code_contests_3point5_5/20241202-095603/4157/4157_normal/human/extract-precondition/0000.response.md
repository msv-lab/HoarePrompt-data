**Precondition**: 
- n is an integer representing the number of trolleybuses, where 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- a is an integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, where 1 <= a <= 10^6.
- d is an integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station, where 1 <= d <= 10^6.
- Each of the n following lines contains two integers ti and vi, where 0 <= t1 < t2 < ... < tn-1 < tn <= 10^6 and 1 <= vi <= 10^6, representing the time when the trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, respectively.
