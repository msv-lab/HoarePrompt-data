Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the provided constraints of acceleration, maximum speed, and distance. It considers the scenario where one trolleybus catches up with another and they travel together to the final station. The logic used to calculate the arrival time for each trolleybus is sound and follows the problem description accurately. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each trolleybus.
