Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the value of `n` will be a positive integer within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9**
