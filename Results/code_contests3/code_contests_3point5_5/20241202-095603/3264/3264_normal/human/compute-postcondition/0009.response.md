Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the value of `n` remains the same. If `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 10^9, then two new values are calculated: ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2. If `n` is a positive even integer between 3 and 10^9, then two new values are printed: (n^2 / 4) - 1 and (n^2 / 4) + 1.***
