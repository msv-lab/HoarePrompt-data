Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and based on the value of `n`, it performs different calculations. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is odd, it calculates and prints two values: ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, it calculates and prints two values: (n^2 / 4) - 1 and (n^2 / 4) + 1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.**
