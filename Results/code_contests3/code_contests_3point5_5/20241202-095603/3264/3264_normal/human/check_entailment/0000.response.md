Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints mention that the code should print two integers `m` and `k` such that `n`, `m`, and `k` form a Pythagorean triple. However, the code does not actually print the values of `m` and `k` as intended. The code contains syntax errors and does not perform the necessary calculations to find `m` and `k` correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
