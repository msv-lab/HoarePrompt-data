Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has syntax errors and logical errors. Firstly, the `raw_input()` function is not valid in Python, it should be `input()`. Secondly, there are issues with parentheses and division in the `if-elif-else` conditions that will throw syntax errors.

Additionally, the logic inside the `if-elif-else` conditions is incorrect. The calculations to find the Pythagorean triples are not correct and will not give the desired output for all potential cases. For example, for the input `6`, it will not give the correct output as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
