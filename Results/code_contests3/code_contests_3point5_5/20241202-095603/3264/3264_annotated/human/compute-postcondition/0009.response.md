Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, then the function does nothing. If n is a positive odd integer larger than 2, where n * n - 1 is divisible by 2 and n * n + 1 is divisible by 2, the function returns the values ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If n is an odd positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the function returns (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1).***
