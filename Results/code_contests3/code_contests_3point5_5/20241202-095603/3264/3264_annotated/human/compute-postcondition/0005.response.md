Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, both calculations will result in integers. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive odd integer, (n * n - 1) / 2 is an integer, (n * n + 1) / 2 is an integer.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, (n * n - 1) / 2 is an integer, (n * n + 1) / 2 is an integer**
