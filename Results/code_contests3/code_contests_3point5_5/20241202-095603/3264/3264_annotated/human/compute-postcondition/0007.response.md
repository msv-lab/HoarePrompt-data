Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two values: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. Since n is an odd integer larger than 2, both values will be integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive odd integer, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the two calculated values are n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the two calculated values are n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1**
