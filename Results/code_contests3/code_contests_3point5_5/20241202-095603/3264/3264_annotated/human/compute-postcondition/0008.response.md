Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is larger than 2. If n is an odd positive integer, where n * n - 1 is divisible by 2 and n * n + 1 is divisible by 2, then the program returns the values (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If n is an odd positive integer, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the program returns n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1.***
