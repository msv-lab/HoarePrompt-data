Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, it prints the values ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is an odd positive integer between 1 and 10^9, it prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and does not have a return value.**
