Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input `n` and follows the problem description accurately. It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and prints -1 in that case. If `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, it prints the values ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2). If `n` is an odd positive integer between 1 and 10^9, it prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The program covers all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct outputs.
