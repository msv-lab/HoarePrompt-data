Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The program produces incorrect results for some inputs. For example, if the input is 3, the program will output 4 5, which is not a valid Pythagorean triple. The correct output should be -1 according to the problem description. Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for and is incorrect.
