Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function does not modify `n`. If `n` is between 3 and 10^9 inclusive, the function updates `n` to be a positive odd integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive if `n` is odd. If `n` is an even number, the function keeps `n` as a positive integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive.***
