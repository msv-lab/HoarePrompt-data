Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2, it calculates and prints two values based on whether `n` is odd or even. For odd `n`, it prints two values derived from `n`. For even `n`, it calculates and prints two values. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.**
