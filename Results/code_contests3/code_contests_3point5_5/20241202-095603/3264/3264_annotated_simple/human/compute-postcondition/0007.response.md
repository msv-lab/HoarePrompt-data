Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is an even number, the result will be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive and `n` is an even number.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive and `n` is an even number**
