Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd positive integer, the result will be an integer as well. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 10^9 inclusive**
