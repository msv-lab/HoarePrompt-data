Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the input is specified to be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, the value of `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9**
