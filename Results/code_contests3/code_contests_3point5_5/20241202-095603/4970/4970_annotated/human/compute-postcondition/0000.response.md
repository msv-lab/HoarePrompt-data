Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value at the index given by the user input from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the initial state specifies that the input integer 'a' is between 0 and 15, the output state will be the value at the index 'a' in the list. 
Output State: **The value at index 'a' in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is printed.**
