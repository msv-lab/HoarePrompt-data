Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func` that takes no parameters. It prints a specific element from a predefined list based on the user input. Since the problem description specifies that the input will be a single integer between 0 and 15, and the program prints the corresponding element from the list based on this input, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
