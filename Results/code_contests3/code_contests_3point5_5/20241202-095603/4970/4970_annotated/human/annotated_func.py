#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15.
def func():
    print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prints a value from a predefined list based on the user input. The function does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to display a specific element from a list based on user input without accepting any parameters and without returning any value.
