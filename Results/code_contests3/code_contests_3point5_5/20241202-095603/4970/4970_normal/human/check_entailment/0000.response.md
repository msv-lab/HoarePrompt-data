Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code prompts the user for an integer input, then prints the corresponding element from a predefined list based on the input value. The list contains the elements in ascending order from 0 to 15. Since the input is restricted to be between 0 and 15, the code will always output the correct element from the list based on the input. The code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the program is working correctly.
