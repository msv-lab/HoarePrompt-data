Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the element from the list based on the input value. The input value is taken using `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer. The list contains elements in a specific order. Based on the input value, a specific element from the list is printed. Since the input value is taken from the user, the output state will vary depending on the input value provided.
Output State: **a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15.**
