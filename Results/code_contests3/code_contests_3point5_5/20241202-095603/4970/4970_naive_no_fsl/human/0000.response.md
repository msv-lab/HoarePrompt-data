Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an integer input and directly uses it as an index to access the corresponding element from a predefined list. Since the input is restricted to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive) and the list contains 16 elements, the program will always output the correct integer based on the input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
