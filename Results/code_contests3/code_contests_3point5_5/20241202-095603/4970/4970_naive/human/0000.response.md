Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer input `a`, then uses that input to index into a list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and prints the corresponding element of the list. Since the input is guaranteed to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive), and the list contains elements for all possible values in that range, the program will always output the correct value for any valid input. Therefore, the program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases.
