The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input. The function will output different messages based on the value of the integer `a` which is constrained to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive). 

If `a` is less than 5, the function will return "Low value".
If `a` is between 5 and 10 (inclusive), the function will return "Medium value".
If `a` is greater than 10, the function will return "High value".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to output a message based on the value of the integer `a` within the specified range. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns different messages based on the value of the integer `a` within the range 0 to 15.**
