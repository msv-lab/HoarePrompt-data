Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the element from the list based on the integer input provided. The list contains elements in a specific order, and the input determines which element to print. Since the input is taken using `raw_input()` function, the value entered will determine the output element. Given the initial state where `a` is an integer between 0 and 15, the output state will depend on the value of `a` and the list indexing. 
Output State: **Output will be the element at the index specified by the input value in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]**.
