Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called func that takes no arguments. Within the function, it creates a list containing integers from 0 to 15 in a specific order. It then takes an integer input using raw_input() and uses that input to index the list and print the corresponding value.

Since the program always returns the correct value based on the input integer by indexing the predefined list, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
