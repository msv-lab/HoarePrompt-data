The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the predefined integer variables n, m, a, and b. n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it performs certain operations based on the values of n, m, a, and b.
