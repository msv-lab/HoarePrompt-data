Correctness: **False**

The provided program is empty and lacks any logic to handle the given problem description. It does not perform any operations or return any value, making it impossible to determine the minimal amount of burles that organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for any potential case. The output hints correctly point out that the function does not have any internal logic.
