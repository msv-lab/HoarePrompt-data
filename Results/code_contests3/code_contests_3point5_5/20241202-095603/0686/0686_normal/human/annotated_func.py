#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates with predefined integer variables n, m, a, and b. The function performs certain operations based on the values of n, m, a, and b. However, since the function is empty and lacks any internal logic, it does not execute any specific functionality or return any value explicitly. It can be considered a placeholder function that may need to be implemented with appropriate logic to achieve a specific task.
