#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are all integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the global variables n, m, a, and b. These variables are all integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function does not return any value, but it performs certain operations based on the values of these variables. The actual operations performed by the function are not specified in the code or annotations.
