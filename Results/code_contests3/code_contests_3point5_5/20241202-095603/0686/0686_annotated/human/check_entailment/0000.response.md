Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not provide any implementation details of how the function `func` should operate. Since the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, it is impossible to determine if the function is correctly solving the given problem. The program does not follow the problem description as it lacks the necessary logic to calculate the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations.
