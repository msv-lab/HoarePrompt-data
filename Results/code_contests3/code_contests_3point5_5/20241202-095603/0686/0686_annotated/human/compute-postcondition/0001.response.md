The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the global variables n, m, a, and b. These variables are all integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function does not return any value, but it performs certain operations based on the values of these variables.
