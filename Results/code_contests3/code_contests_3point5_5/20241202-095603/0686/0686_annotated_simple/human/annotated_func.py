#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined integer variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` that satisfy the constraints given. The function should perform a calculation based on these variables and return a specific output. However, since the function body is empty, it does not perform any operations or return any values. This is a missing functionality that needs to be addressed in the implementation.
