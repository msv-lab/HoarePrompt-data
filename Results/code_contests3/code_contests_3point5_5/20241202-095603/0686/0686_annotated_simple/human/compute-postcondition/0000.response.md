Initial State: n, m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.

```
n += a
m -= b
```

Example Answer:
n is incremented by a and m is decremented by b. The previous values of n, m, a, and b are known, so after execution, n will be the previous value of n plus a, and m will be the previous value of m minus b. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a new value based on the previous n and a, m is a new value based on the previous m and b, a and b remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is a new value based on the previous n and a, m is a new value based on the previous m and b, a and b remain unchanged**.
