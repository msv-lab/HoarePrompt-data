#State of the program right berfore the function call: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.**
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes two space-separated float inputs, `t` and `x`, and prints the result of `t / x`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
