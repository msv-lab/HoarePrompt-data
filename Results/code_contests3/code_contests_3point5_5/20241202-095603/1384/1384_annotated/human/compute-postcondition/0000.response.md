Example Answer: 
`t` and `x` are assigned the values of `float(input().split())`. The `input().split()` function accepts input and splits it by spaces, and `float` converts the input to a floating-point number. Therefore, after execution, `t` and `x` will hold the floating-point values entered by the user.
Output State: **`t` and `x` are floating-point numbers entered by the user**
