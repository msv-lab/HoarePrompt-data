Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code takes two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` as input, divides `t` by `x`, and prints the result. This aligns with the problem description which asks for the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality. Additionally, the code handles the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
