Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers as input, representing the number of hours Taro needs to study and the speed at which time passes in World B compared to World A. It then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X, and prints the result.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the output based on the given inputs, it is correct for all potential cases.
