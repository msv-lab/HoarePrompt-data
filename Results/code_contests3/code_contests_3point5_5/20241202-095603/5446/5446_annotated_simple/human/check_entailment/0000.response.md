Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program calculates the maximum possible number of pieces on each plate, but it does not take into account the condition that each plate must contain at least one piece of cake. Additionally, the calculation of x is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description and thus the correctness is **False**.
