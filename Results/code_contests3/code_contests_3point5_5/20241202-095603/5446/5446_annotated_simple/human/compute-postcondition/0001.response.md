Example Answer:
The variable `x` is assigned the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c` as a float. Depending on the input values of `b` and `c`, the value of `x` will vary. 
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input provided; `x` is the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c` as a float.**
