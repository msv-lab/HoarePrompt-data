Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One issue lies in the line:
```
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
```
This line is calculating the ratio between the maximum number of pieces in a cake and the minimum number of pieces in a cake. However, this calculation does not directly relate to the requirement of distributing the cakes among plates such that each plate contains at least x pieces of cake. 

Another issue is with the calculation of the maximum possible number x:
```
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```
The calculation is based on the minimum number of pieces of cake between the two cakes divided by the number of plates, multiplied by the calculated x value. This calculation does not necessarily guarantee the maximum possible number x as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem described.
