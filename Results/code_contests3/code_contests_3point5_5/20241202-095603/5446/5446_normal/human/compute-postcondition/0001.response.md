Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Since `b` and `c` are input integers, their values can vary. Therefore, after execution, `x` will have a specific floating-point value based on the input values of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `x` has a specific floating-point value based on the input values of `b` and `c**.
