Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum possible number of pieces on a plate incorrectly and does not follow the conditions outlined in the problem description. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4 7 10
```
The expected output is 3, but the program outputs 2. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
