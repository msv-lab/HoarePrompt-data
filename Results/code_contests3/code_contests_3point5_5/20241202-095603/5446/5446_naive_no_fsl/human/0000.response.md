Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it is not following the problem description. The formula used to calculate x is incorrect. The program is trying to calculate x based on the ratio of the maximum and minimum number of pieces of cake, which does not align with the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The correct approach should involve distributing the cakes in such a way that each plate contains at least x pieces of cake. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
