Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program incorrectly calculates the value of `x` by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, which is not the correct approach to find the maximum possible number of pieces that can be distributed on each plate. The program also uses the `ceil` function which is not necessary and does not follow the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes according to the conditions mentioned in the problem description for every potential case.
