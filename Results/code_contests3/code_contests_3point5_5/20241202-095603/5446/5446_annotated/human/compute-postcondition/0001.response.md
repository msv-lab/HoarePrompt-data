Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The division result is converted to a float. Since the initial values of `b` and `c` are given as integers, the division result will have a decimal point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float obtained by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float obtained by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`**
