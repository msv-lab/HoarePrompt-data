Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` from user input, calculates a value `x` based on the division of the maximum by the minimum of `b` and `c`, and then prints the result of a mathematical expression involving `n`, `b`, `c`, `x`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output.**
