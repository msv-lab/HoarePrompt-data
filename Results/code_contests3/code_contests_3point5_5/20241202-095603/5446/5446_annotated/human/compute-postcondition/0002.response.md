Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Then, the expression inside the `print` statement is evaluated. The `ceil` function is used to round up the result of `min(b, c) / float(n) * x` to the nearest integer. Finally, the result is printed out. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float obtained by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, the value obtained after the calculation inside the `print` statement is printed as an integer.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values based on the input; `x` is a float obtained by dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, the calculated integer value from the expression inside the `print` statement is returned**
