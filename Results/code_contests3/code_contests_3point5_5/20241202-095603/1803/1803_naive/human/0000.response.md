Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers the letters at positions which are multiples of 3 in the input string, which is not a correct approach to solve the problem. 

For example, if the input is "{a, b, c, a, c}", the program will output 1 instead of 3, as it only considers the letters at positions 1, 4 and 7.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
