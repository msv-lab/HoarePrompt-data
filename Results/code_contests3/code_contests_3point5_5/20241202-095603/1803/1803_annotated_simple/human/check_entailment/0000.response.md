Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The program only considers every third character in the input string, which will not work for all cases. For example, if the input string is "{a, b, a, b, c}", the program will output 2 instead of the correct answer of 3.

To fix this issue, the program should split the input string by ", " and then convert it into a set to get the distinct letters. The correct implementation should be like this:

```python
def func():
    Cadena = input().strip("{}")  # Remove the curly braces from the input
    letters = set(Cadena.split(", "))
    
    print(len(letters))
```

This corrected program will output the correct number of distinct letters in Anton's set for all cases provided in the problem description.
