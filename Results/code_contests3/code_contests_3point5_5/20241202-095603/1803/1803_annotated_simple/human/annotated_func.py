#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string represents a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space. The length of the input string does not exceed 1000 characters.**
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Cadena` length is no longer greater than `k` and greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains elements added from the loop iterations, `k` is incremented by 3 and no longer satisfies the loop condition
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string that represents a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space. It then iterates over the input string, extracts every third character starting from the second character, and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. Finally, it prints the number of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, the code does not handle or indicate any errors if the input format is incorrect or if the input string does not match the expected pattern, which could be considered as a missing functionality.
