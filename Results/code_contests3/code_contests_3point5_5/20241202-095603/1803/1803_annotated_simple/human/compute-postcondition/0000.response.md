The input string represents a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space. The length of the input string does not exceed 1000 characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space**
