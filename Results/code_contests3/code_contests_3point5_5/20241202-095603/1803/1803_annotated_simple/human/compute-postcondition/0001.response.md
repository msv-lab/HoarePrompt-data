Example Answer:
No changes occur to the variable `Cadena`, but an empty list `Arreglo` is initialized. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` is an empty list.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` is an empty list**
