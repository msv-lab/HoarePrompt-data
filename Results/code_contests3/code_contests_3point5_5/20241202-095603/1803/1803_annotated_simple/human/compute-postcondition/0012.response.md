Based on the loop code and the provided output states, we can determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed.

The loop continues as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2. In each iteration, the element at index `k` of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo`, and `k` is incremented by 3.

Given the conditions and the increment value of `k`, we can see that the loop will keep adding elements to `Arreglo` until the length of `Cadena` is no longer greater than `k` and greater than 2. At that point, the loop will terminate.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
Output State: **`Cadena` length is no longer greater than `k` and greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains elements added from the loop iterations, `k` is incremented by 3 and no longer satisfies the loop condition**
