Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is appended with the element at index `k` of `Cadena`, which increases the size of `Arreglo`. `Cadena` and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`Cadena` has a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena` and additional elements from further iterations, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`**
