Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` has a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena` and additional elements from further iterations, `k` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`Cadena` has a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena` and additional elements from further iterations, `k` is incremented by 3**
