Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value 1. Since `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by the code, the output state is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1**
