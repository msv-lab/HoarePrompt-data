Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string that represents a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, with each letter separated by a comma and a space. It then iterates over the input string, extracts every third character starting from the second character, and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. Finally, it prints the number of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. However, the code does not handle or indicate any errors if the input format is incorrect or if the input string does not match the expected pattern, which could be considered as a missing functionality.**
