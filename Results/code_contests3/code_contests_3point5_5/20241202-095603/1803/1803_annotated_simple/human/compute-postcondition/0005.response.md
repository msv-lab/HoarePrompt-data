Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3, so k becomes 4. Since `Arreglo` contains the element at index `k` of `Cadena`, and `k` is now 4, `Arreglo` will contain the element at index 4 of `Cadena`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` has a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` has a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
