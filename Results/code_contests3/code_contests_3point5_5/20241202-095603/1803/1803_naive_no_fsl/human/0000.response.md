Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It has some logical errors in the while loop condition and the way it is trying to extract the letters from the input string. Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the input set is empty.

For example, if the input is "{a, b, c}" the program will output 1 instead of 3 because it is not correctly extracting the letters from the input string.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
