The function `func` reads an input string containing small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets. It then extracts elements from specific indexes in the input string and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. The function then prints the count of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not explicitly return a value.
