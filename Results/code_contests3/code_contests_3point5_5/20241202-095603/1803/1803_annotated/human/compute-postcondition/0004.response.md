Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is appended with the element at index `k` of `Cadena`, where `k` is 2. The length of `Cadena` is not given, so the value at index 2 is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, with a length not exceeding 1000; `k` is 2; `Arreglo` is appended with an unknown element from `Cadena`.
Output State: **Cadena contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, with a length not exceeding 1000; `k` is 2; `Arreglo` is appended with an unknown element from `Cadena`**
