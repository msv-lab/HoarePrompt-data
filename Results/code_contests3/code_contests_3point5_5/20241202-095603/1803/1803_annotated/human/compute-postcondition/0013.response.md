Example Answer:
The elements at indexes 5, 8, and 11 from `Cadena` are appended to `Arreglo`, and then converted into a set to remove duplicates, and finally, the length of the set is printed. Since `k` is 11, the elements are appended to `Arreglo` from the respective indexes. The set operation ensures uniqueness, and the length of the set is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, with a length greater than 11 and greater than 2; `k` is 11; `Arreglo` contains the appended elements from `Cadena` at indexes 5, 8, and 11, and the length of the set of `Arreglo` elements is printed.
Output State: **`Cadena` contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets, with a length greater than 11 and greater than 2; `k` is 11; `Arreglo` contains the appended elements from `Cadena` at indexes 5, 8, and 11, and the length of the set of `Arreglo` elements is printed.**
