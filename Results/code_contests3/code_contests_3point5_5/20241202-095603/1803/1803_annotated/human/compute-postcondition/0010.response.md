Example Answer: 
The value at index 5 of `Cadena` is appended to the list `Arreglo`, which already contains an element. Since `k` is 8, the character at index 8 of `Cadena` is appended to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets with a length greater than 5 and greater than 2, `k` is 8, `Arreglo` contains two elements with the appended element from `Cadena` at index 5 and index 8.
Output State: **`Cadena` contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets with a length greater than 5 and greater than 2, `k` is 8, `Arreglo` contains two elements with the appended element from `Cadena` at index 5 and index 8**
