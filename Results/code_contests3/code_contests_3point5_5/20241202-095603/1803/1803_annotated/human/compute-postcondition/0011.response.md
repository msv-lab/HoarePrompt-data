Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 3`, where `k` is 8. After execution, `k` becomes 11. The variables `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets with a length greater than 5 and greater than 2, `k` is 11, `Arreglo` contains two elements with the appended element from `Cadena` at index 5 and index 8.
