Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set, but it currently extracts elements from specific indexes in the input string and stores them in a list. This will not give the correct count of distinct letters in the set. The program is not fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
