Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `k` is the previous value of `k` plus 3, ensuring that `k` remains less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1, `Cadena` length is greater than 2, `k` is incremented by 3**
