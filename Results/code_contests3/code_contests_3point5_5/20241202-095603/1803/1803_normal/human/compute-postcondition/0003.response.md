According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `Cadena` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. Right before the loop, `Arreglo` is an empty list and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `Cadena` needs to have a length greater than 1 and `k` must be less than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `Cadena` length is greater than 1 and `k` is less than 2**
