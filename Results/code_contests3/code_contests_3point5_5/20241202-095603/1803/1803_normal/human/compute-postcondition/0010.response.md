Example Answer:
The list `Arreglo` is updated by adding the element at index `k` from the list `Cadena`. The value of `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1. The length of `Cadena` is already greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1, `Cadena` length is greater than 2.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena` plus 1, `Cadena` length is greater than 2**
