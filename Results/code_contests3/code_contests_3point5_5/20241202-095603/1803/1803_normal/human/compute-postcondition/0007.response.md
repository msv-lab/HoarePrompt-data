Example Answer:
The element at index `k` of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo` list. The index `k` is adjusted to be less than the length of `Cadena`. Since `Cadena` length is greater than 2, the new element is added to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the length of `Cadena`, `Cadena` length is greater than 2.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the length of `Cadena`, `Cadena` length is greater than 2**
