Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string containing a set of letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets. It then extracts every third character from the input string and stores it in a list `Arreglo`. After processing, it prints the count of unique elements in the `Arreglo` list. The function does not explicitly return any value. The loop continues as long as the length of the input string is greater than the current index `k` and the length of the input string is greater than 2. However, there is a potential issue with the loop termination condition as it only considers the length of `Cadena` and not the length of `Arreglo` which may lead to unexpected behavior if the condition is not met.**
