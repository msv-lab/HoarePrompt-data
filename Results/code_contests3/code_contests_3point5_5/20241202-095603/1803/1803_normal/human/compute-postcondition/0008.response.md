Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` was adjusted to be less than the length of `Cadena`, so after execution, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena`, `Cadena` length is greater than 2.
Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing the updated elements from `Cadena`, `k` is adjusted to be less than the new length of `Cadena`, `Cadena` length is greater than 2**
