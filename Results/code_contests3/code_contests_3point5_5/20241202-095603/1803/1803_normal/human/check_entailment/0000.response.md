Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The loop termination condition only considers the length of the input string `Cadena` and not the length of the `Arreglo` list. This may lead to unexpected behavior if the condition is not met. Additionally, the code does not correctly handle cases where the same letter is repeated multiple times in the input set, as it only extracts and counts distinct letters. 

For example, consider the input:
```
{a, a, b}
```
The code will output `2` instead of the correct answer which is `2`. This shows that the code does not handle repeated letters correctly.
