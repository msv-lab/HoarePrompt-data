Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input text of words, calculates the volume of the text by finding the maximum number of uppercase letters in a single word, and then prints this volume. The program iterates through each word in the text and counts the uppercase letters in each word to determine the maximum volume of the text. The final output is the correct volume of the text. The program covers all cases as described in the problem description and produces the expected output.
