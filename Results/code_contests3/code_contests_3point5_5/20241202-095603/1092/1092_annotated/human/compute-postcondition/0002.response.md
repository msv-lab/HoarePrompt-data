Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value 0. Since the previous values of `n` and `l` are not affected by this operation, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the text; l is a list of words extracted from the input text; m is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text; l is a list of words extracted from the input text; m is 0**
