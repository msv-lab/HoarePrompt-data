According to the code, the loop can execute for each word in the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is a word in the list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l`, `j` is an uppercase letter. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `m` may need to be updated based on the uppercase letters in the next word `i`.
- `i` will be the next word in the list `l`.
- `s` may need to be updated based on the uppercase letters in the next word `i`.
- `j` will be the uppercase letter from the next word `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l`, `j` is an uppercase letter.**
