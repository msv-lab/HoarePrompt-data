Functionality: **The function reads a text input consisting of words separated by spaces and calculates the maximum number of uppercase letters in a single word. It does not explicitly require any input parameters, so the annotations regarding `n` are irrelevant. The function does not return any value, it only prints the maximum count of uppercase letters in a word. Additionally, the function lacks error handling for cases where the input is not in the expected format or if there are no uppercase letters in any word.**
