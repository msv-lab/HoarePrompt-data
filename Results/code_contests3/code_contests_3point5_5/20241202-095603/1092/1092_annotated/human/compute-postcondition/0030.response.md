Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and the current value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the first word in the list `l` which is a string, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and the current value of `m`, `i` is the first word in the list `l` which is a string, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l`**
