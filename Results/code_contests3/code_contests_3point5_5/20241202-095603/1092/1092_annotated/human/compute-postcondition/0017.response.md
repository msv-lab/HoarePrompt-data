According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are still words in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the list `l` and 0, `i` is the last word in the list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the list `l`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and 0, `i` is the second-to-last word in the list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l`.**
