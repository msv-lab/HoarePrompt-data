Example Answer:
The input text is split based on spaces into a list `l`. The length of the list `l` will be the number of words in the input text, which is represented by the positive integer `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the text; l is a list of words extracted from the input text.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text; l is a list of words extracted from the input text**
