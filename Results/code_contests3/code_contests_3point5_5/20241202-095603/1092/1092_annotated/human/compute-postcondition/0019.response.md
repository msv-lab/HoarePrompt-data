According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is an iterable object like a string or list. Since `i` is the second-to-last word in the list `l`, it is likely a string. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be a string that is the second-to-last word in the list `l`. In addition, `s` is set to 0 before the loop starts, so for the loop to execute, `s` should be adjusted to 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list of words with at least one word remaining after removing the last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase letters in all words in the updated list `l` and 0, `i` is the second-to-last word in the list `l` which is a string, `s` is 0 for the loop to execute**
