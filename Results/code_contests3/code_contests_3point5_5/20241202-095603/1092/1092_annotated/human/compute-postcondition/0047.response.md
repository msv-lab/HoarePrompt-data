The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly expects a positive integer `n` representing the length of the text, and a text consisting of `n` words separated by single spaces, with each word consisting of small and capital Latin letters. The function processes the input text and returns some output based on the given constraints and relationships.
