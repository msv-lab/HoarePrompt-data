Example Answer: 
No variables are assigned any values or changed in this code snippet. The `raw_input()` function is called to accept input, but the input is not stored in any variable. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text. The text consists of n words separated by single spaces, where each word contains only small and capital Latin letters.**
