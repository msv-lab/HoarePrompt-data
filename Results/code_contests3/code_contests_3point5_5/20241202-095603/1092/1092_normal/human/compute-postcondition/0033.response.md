According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `i` is iterable. Since `i` is the next word in the list `l`, it implies that `l` is a list of words and `i` is the next word in that list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` should be a word in the list `l`. Additionally, since `j` is used as the loop variable, it should take the value of each element in `i`, which is a word. Therefore, `j` should be the next word in the list `l`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is a word in the list `l` and `j` is the next word in the list `l`**
