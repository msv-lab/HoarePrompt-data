Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The value of `s` represents the total number of uppercase letters in the first word `i` of the list `l`. The maximum value between `s` and `m` is then assigned to `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the first word in the new list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the first word in the new list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`**
