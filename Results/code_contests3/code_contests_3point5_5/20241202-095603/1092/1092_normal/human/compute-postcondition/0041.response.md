Example Answer:
The value of `s` is increased by 1. Since `s` is already increased by 2 in the initial state, after execution, `s` will be increased by a total of 3. The other variables `n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by 3, for the loop to execute `i` is a word in the list `l` and `j` is the next word in the list `l`, if `j` is an uppercase word, then the function executes the if part and `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is a word in the list `l`, `j` is the next word in the list `l`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by 3, for the loop to execute `i` is a word in the list `l` and `j` is the next word in the list `l`, if `j` is an uppercase word, then the function executes the if part and `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is a word in the list `l`, `j` is the next word in the list `l`.**
