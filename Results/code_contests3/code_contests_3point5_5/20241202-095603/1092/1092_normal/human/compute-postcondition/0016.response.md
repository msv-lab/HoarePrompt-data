Example Answer:
`s` represents the total number of uppercase letters in the word represented by `i`. `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Since `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in the word represented by `i`, and `m` is initially 0, if `s` is greater than 0, `m` will be updated to the value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is not empty, m is the maximum value between s and m, i is the first word in the list l, s is the total number of uppercase letters in the word represented by i.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is not empty, m is the maximum value between s and m, i is the first word in the list l, s is the total number of uppercase letters in the word represented by i**
