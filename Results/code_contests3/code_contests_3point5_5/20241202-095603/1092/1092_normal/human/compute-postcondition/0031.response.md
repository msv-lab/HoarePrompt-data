According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the first word in the new list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next word in the list `l` will become `i`, and its total number of uppercase letters will be calculated and stored in `s`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`**
