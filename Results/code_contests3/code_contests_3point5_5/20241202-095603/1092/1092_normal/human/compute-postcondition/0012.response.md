According to the code, whether the loop can execute for another time depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is an uppercase character in the next word, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is not empty, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by 1. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be the first word in the list `l`, and `j` must be an uppercase character in the word represented by `i`.

State: **n is a positive integer, l is not empty, m is 0, i is the first word in the list l, s is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time j is an uppercase character in the word represented by i**
