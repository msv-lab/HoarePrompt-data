Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned as the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Since `m` is already defined as the maximum value between `s` and `m`, there is no change in the value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by the number of uppercase words in the list `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by the number of uppercase words in the list `i`**
