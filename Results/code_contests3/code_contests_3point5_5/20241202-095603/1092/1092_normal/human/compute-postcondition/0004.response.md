Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `l`, `m`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is not empty, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is not empty, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
