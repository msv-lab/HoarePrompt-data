According to the code, the loop will execute if the list `l` is not empty. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, it indicates that there are at least `n` words in the text. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `l` should not be empty and `m` should be adjusted to 0, and `i` should be the first word in the list `l`.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is not empty, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list `l`**
