According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the word represented by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is not empty, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is an uppercase letter. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the word represented by `i` needs to be considered.
State: **n is a positive integer, l is not empty, m is 0, i is the first word in the list l, s is 1, for the loop to execute one more time i is the first word in the list l, and j is the next character in the word represented by i**
