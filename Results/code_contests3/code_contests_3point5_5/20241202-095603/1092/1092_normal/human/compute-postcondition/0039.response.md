Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `s` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute `i` is a word in the list `l` and `j` is the next word in the list `l`, if `j` is an uppercase word, then the function executes the if part and `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is a word in the list `l`, `j` is the next word in the list `l`.***
