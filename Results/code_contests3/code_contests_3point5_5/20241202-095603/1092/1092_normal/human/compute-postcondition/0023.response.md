According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is still within the elements of `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` still has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the first word in the new list `l`, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the first element in `i`, and `j` is uppercase. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should still be within the elements of `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` has more elements, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and `m`, `i` is the first word in the new list `l`, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` is the next element in `i`, and `j` is uppercase.**
