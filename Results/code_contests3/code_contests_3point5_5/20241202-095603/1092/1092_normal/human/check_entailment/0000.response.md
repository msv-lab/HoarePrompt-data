Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided reads an input text of single-space separated words, consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It then calculates the volume of the text by finding the word with the maximum number of uppercase letters in it. The code iterates through each word, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count found so far. Finally, it prints out this maximum count as the volume of the text.

The code directly aligns with the problem description as it correctly identifies the volume of the given text by calculating the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word. It handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples. The output hints also corroborate the functionality of the code by confirming that it calculates the maximum volume of the text accurately. Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem requirements, the correctness of the code can be deemed as True.
