According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If there are words left in the list `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the nth word in list `l`, `s` is 1 if `j` is an uppercase character. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more words left in the list `l`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the (n+1)th word in list `l`, `s` is 1 if `j` is an uppercase character**
