Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `m`. Since no calculations or assignments are made in the code snippet provided, the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the last word in list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the word `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the last word in list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the word `i`**
