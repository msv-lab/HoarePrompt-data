Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of word `i` for the loop to execute. If the first character of the first word in list `l` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is set to 1.***
