According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the word `i` in the list `l`. If there are more words left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `s` are as described.
For the loop to be executed one more time, you need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the (n+2)th word in list `l`, `s` is increased by 1 if `j` is an uppercase character**
