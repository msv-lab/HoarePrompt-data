According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is the (n+1)th word in list `l`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variables that need adjustment are `m` and `s`. The variable `m` needs to be updated to the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, and `s` needs to be updated to the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the (n+1)th word in list `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list `l`**
