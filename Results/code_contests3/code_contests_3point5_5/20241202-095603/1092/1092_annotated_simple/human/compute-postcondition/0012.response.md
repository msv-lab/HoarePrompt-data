According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the word `i` and the current character `j`. If there are more characters left in word `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, `j` is the next character in word `i`. For the next iteration, the character `j` should move to the next character in word `i` and `s` should be updated based on the case of `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, `j` is the next character in word `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters left in word `i` and `s` should be updated based on the case of the next character `j`.**
