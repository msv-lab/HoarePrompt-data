According to the code, the loop can execute if the list l has at least 1 word. Since n represents the number of words in the list l, if n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, m is 0 does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, adjust the state to `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of n words, and `i` is the first word in the list l.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words, m is 0, for the loop to execute the first time i is the first word in the list l**
