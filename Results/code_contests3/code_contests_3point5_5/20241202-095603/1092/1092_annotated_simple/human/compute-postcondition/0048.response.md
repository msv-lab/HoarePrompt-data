Functionality: **The function `func` processes `n` words separated by single spaces, consisting of small and capital Latin letters. It iterates over each word to count the number of uppercase characters in that word and keeps track of the maximum count found among all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase characters found in any single word. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.**
