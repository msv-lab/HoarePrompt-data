Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and `l` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words, m is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words, m is 0**
