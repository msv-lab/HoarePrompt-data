According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` which is the (n+1)th word in list l. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l and the initial value of m, i is the (n+1)th word in list l, s is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l incremented by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the (n+1)th word i should be present in the list l and it should not be the last word in the list.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of (n+1) words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l and the initial value of m, i is the (n+1)th word in list l, s is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l incremented by 2, for the loop to execute one more time i should not be the last word in list l.**
