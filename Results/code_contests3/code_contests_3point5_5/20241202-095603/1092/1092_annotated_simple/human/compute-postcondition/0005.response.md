According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is a word in list `l`. If the list `l` has at least 1 word, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, `i` must be a word in the list `l`. At the start of the loop, `j` will take each character of the word `i`. So, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 0, and `j` is the first character of word `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 0, `j` is the first character of word `i` for the loop to execute**
