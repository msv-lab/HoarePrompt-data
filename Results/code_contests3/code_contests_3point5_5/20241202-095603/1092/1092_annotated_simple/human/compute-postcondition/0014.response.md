Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 1 or 3 depending on the condition, `j` is the next character in word `i`. If the next character `j` is uppercase, then `s` is updated to 2 or 3 based on the previous value of `s`.***
