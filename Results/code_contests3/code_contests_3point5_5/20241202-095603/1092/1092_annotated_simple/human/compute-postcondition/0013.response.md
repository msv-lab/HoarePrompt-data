Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is either 1 or 2, so after execution, `s` will be either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value, `j` is the next character in word `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 2 or 3 depending on the previous value, `j` is the next character in word `i`**
