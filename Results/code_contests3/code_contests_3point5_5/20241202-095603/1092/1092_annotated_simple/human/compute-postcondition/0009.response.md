According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than the length of word `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of word `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in word `i` needs to be considered. If the next character exists in word `i`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the next character in word `i` for the loop to execute**
