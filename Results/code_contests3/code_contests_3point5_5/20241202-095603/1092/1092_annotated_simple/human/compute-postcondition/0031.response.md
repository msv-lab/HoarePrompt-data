According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list l. If there are more words left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer, l is a list of (n+1) words, m is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l and the initial value of m, i is the (n+1)th word in list l, s is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, l is a list of n words with at least 1 word, m is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l and the initial value of m, i is the nth word in list l, s is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in list l**
