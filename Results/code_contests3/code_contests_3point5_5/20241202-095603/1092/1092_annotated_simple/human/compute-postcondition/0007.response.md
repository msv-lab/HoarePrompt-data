Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of word `i` for the loop to execute. The first character of the first word in list `l` is an uppercase letter.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list of n words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of word `i` for the loop to execute. The first character of the first word in list `l` is an uppercase letter**
