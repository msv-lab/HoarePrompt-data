Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads the input values N, Q, S, l, and r. It then iterates through the string S to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to each index and stores this count in the list P. Finally, for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substring by taking the difference between the count at index r and the count at index l.

This program follows the problem description and correctly outputs the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substrings for all queries.
