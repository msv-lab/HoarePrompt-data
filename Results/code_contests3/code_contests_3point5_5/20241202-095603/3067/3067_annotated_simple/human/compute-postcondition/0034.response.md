According to the code, the loop can execute `Q` times. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `Q` needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers representing occurrences of 'AC', `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed**
