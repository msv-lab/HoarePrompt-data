Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers representing occurrences of 'AC' in `S`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the differences between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` for all `Q` iterations are printed**
