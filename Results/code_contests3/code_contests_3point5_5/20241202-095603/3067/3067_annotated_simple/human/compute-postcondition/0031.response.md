According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Q`. If `_` is less than `Q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is greater than 0. Since `_` is the loop variable that increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 1, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers representing occurrences of 'AC', `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed**
