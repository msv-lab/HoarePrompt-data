Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `i` is less than `N`. Since `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, and `P[0]` is 0, after execution, all elements of `P` retain their initial values of 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, `i` is less than `N`, and `P[0]` is 0, and after the execution of the if else block, `P[0]` remains 0 and all other elements of `P` retain their initial values.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, `i` is less than `N`, and `P[0]` is 0, and after the execution of the if else block, `P[0]` remains 0 and all other elements of `P` retain their initial values.**
