Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers with each element incremented by 1 starting from 0, `i` is less than `N + 1`, `P[0]` is 0. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then each element of `P` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]` for the current value of `i`.***
