Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input. The variables `N` and `Q` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned input integers, `S` is a string input.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned input integers, `S` is a string input**
