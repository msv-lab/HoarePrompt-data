Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, `i` is less than `N`, and `P[0]` is 0. After the execution of the if else block, `P[0]` remains 0 and all other elements of `P` retain their initial values.***
