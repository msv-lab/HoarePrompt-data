Example Answer:
`P` is assigned a list of `N + 1` zeros. The values of `N` and `Q` are input integers, and `S` is a string input. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are input integers, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are input integers, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros**
