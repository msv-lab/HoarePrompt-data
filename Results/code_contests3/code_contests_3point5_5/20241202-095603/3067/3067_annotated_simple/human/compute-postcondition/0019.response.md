Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, `i` is less than `N`, `P[0]` is 0. If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is incremented by 1 compared to the previous value. Otherwise, all elements of `P` retain their initial values after the execution of the if else block.***
