Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0. Since `i` is 0 for the first iteration, `P[i]` will be set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is an input integer, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros with the first element set to 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the current loop or if statement. The substring from `S` at index `i - 1` to index `i + 1` is not equal to 'AC'.
