Example Answer:
The code calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' between indices `l` and `r` in the input string `S` using the prefix sum array `P`. It subtracts the number of occurrences at index `l - 1` from the number of occurrences at index `r - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers representing occurrences of 'AC', `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed.
Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input, `P` is a list of `N + 1` integers representing occurrences of 'AC', `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed**
