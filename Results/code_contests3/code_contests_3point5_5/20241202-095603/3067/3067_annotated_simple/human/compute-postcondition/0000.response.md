Example Answer:
`N` and `Q` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string using `split()` and converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `N` and `Q` depend on the input provided, so the specific values cannot be determined without the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned input integers**
