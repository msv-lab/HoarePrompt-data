The function reads inputs for N, Q, and a string S. It then calculates the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string S up to each index and stores them in a list P. After that, for each pair of integers l and r from the input, it prints the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1]. The function does not accept any parameters and only performs the described operations on the inputs provided.
