The function `func` reads input values N and Q, followed by a string S. It then calculates the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to each index i-1 and stores these counts in the list P. After this calculation, it reads Q pairs of integers l and r, and prints the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] for each pair.
