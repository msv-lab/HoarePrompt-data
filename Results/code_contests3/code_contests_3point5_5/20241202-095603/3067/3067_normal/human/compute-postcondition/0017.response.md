Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned as P[i - 1] + 1. Initially, P[0] is 0. The value of 'i' is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of P[i]. Therefore, the Output State is: N, Q, S are assigned values from input. P is a list of size N+1 with updated values according to the conditions specified. If 'i' == 0, 'i' may be incremented by 1 and P[i] is updated if 'AC' is found in the specified substring of S, otherwise 'i' remains the same and P[i] retains its previous value. P[0] is initialized to 0.
