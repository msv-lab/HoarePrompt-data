Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0. The values of N, Q, and S are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N, Q are assigned values from the input split by space; S is assigned the raw input, P is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **N, Q are assigned values from the input split by space; S is assigned the raw input, P is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0**
