According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Q`. If `Q` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `Q` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and the value of P[r - 1] - P[l - 1] is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `Q` must be greater than 0**
