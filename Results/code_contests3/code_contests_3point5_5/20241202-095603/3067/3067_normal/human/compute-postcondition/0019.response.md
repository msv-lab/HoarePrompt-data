Postcondition: ***N, Q, S are assigned values from input. P is a list of size N+1 with updated values according to the conditions specified. If 'i' == 0, 'i' may be incremented by 1 and P[i] is updated if 'AC' is found in the specified substring of S, otherwise 'i' remains the same and P[i] retains its previous value. P[0] is initialized to 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] is updated based on the conditions specified. Otherwise, all values of P except P[0] remain 0 after the execution of the if else block.***
