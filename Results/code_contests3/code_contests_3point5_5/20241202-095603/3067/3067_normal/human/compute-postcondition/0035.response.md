Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned the integer values after splitting the input. The loop will execute one more time if `_` is less than `Q`, but the initial values of `_` and `Q` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are assigned integer values after splitting the input.
Output State: **`l` and `r` are assigned integer values after splitting the input**
