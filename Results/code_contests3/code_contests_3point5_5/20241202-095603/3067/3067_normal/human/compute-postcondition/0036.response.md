Example Answer:
The value of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is printed. The values of `l` and `r` are already assigned integer values after splitting the input. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are assigned integer values after splitting the input.
Output State: **`l` and `r` are assigned integer values after splitting the input**
