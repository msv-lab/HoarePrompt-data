Output State: **N, Q, S are assigned values from input. P is a list of size N+1 with updated values according to the conditions specified. P[0] is initialized to 0. If 'i' == 0 and 'AC' is found in the substring of S, 'i' is incremented by 1 and P[i] is updated. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] is updated based on the conditions specified. Otherwise, all values of P except P[0] remain 0. The loop will execute one more time if 'i' is less than 'N'.**
