Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between the element at index `r - 1` and the element at index `l - 1` in the list `P`. The values of `l` and `r` are obtained from the input after splitting. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting**
