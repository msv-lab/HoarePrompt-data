According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `Q`. If `_` is less than `Q`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` should be less than `Q`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input after splitting, for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be less than `Q`**
