Example Answer: 
The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The initial state of `P` is a list of size `N+1` with updated values according to the conditions specified. If `i` is 0 and 'AC' is found in the specified substring of `S`, then `i` may be incremented by 1 and `P[i]` is updated. If `S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC'`, `P[i]` is updated based on the conditions specified. Otherwise, all values of `P` except `P[0]` remain 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.
Output State: **P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]**
