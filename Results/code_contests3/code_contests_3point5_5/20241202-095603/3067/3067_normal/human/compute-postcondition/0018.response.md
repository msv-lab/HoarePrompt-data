Example Answer: 
P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. Since the initial state of P[0] is 0, P[i] will be 0 for any i greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N, Q, S are assigned values from input, P is a list of size N+1 with updated values according to the conditions specified where all values except P[0] are 0. 
Output State: **N, Q, S are assigned values from input, P is a list of size N+1 with updated values according to the conditions specified where all values except P[0] are 0.**
