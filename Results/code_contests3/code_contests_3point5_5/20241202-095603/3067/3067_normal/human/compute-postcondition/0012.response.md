Postcondition: ***N, Q, S are assigned values from input. P is a list of size N+1 with all elements initialized to 0. i is either incremented by 1 and P[i] is updated as P[i - 1] + 1 if 'AC' is found in the substring of S starting from index i-1 and ending at index i+1, or i remains at 0 and P[i] retains its previous value if 'AC' is not found. The loop continues without making changes to the variables.***
