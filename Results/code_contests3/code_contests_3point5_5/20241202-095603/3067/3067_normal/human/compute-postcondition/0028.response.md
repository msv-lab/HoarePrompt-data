According to the code, the loop will execute Q times. Since the final state of P is a list of size N+1, and each element P[i] depends on the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to index i-1, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **After all iterations of the loop, P will be a list of size N+1 where each element P[i] will contain the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to index i-1. If 'AC' is not found in the substring of S at index i-1 to i, P[i] will be equal to P[i-1].**
