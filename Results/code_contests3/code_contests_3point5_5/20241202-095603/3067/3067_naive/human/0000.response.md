Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of times the substring 'AC' occurs in the specified range of the input string S. The program maintains a prefix sum array P where P[i] stores the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index i in the string S. Then for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified range by taking the difference between P[r-1] and P[l-1]. This logic is consistent with the problem description and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
