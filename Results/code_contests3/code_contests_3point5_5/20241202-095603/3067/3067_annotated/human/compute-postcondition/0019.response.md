Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 with elements P[0] = 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1 and i is increased by 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. After the execution of the if-else block, P[0] remains 0 and the program proceeds to the next iteration or statement.***
