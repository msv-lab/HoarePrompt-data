Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned values based on the input from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `l` and `r` are now integers obtained from splitting the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1, Q is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1, Q is greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input**
