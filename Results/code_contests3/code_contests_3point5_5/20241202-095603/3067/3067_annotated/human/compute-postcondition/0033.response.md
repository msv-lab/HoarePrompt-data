Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the difference between the element at index r-1 and the element at index l-1 in the list P. The values of l and r are based on the input from raw_input(). The output state will be the same as the initial state except for the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1, Q is greater than 0, l and r are assigned values based on the input from raw_input(), the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed.**
