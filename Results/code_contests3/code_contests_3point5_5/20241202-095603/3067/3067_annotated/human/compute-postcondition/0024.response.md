Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is updated to be P[i - 1] + 1. This means that the value at index i in list P will be incremented by 1 compared to the value at index i - 1. The other variables N and S remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 with elements P[0] = 0, the substring of S at index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC'. The value at index i in list P is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 with elements P[0] = 0, the substring of S at index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC'. The value at index i in list P is incremented by 1**
