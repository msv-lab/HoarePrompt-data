Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0. If i == 0, then P[0] is 0 and the program continues with the next iteration or step. When the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is true, the state of the program variables is such that the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1 is equal to 'AC'. P[i] is updated with the value of P[i - 1] + 1.**
