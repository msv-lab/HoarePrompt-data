Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. Since all the elements of P are initially 0, P[i] will also be 0 for all i. The condition that the substring S[i - 1:i + 1] does not equal 'AC' is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0, and P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]**
