Functionality: **The function reads input values N, Q, S, and a list P. It then iterates through the string S to calculate values in the list P based on certain conditions. Afterwards, for each iteration in the range of Q, it reads input values l and r and prints the calculated difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1]. The function does not accept any parameters and returns specific output based on the inputs provided.**
