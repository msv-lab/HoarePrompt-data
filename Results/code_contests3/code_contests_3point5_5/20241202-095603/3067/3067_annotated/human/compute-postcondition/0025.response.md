Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `i` is a specific index. The value of `P[i - 1]` is known as it is specified in the initial state that `P[0] = 0`. Therefore, the value of `P[i]` becomes the same as `P[i - 1]`, which is 0. The other variables `N` and `S` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 with elements P[0] = 0, the substring of S at index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC'. If i == 0, no changes occur to the variables N, S, and P. P[i] is 0**
