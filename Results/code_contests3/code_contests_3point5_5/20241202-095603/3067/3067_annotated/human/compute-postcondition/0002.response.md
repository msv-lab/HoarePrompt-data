Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of size N+1 where each element is 0. The values of N and Q are known but the value of S is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are input integers, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0.
Output State: **N and Q are input integers, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0**
