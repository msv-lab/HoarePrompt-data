Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 with elements P[0] = 0. If the substring of S at index i-1 to i+1 is 'AC', then the value at index i in list P is incremented by 1. If i == 0, no changes occur to the variables N, S, and P. Otherwise, if the substring is not 'AC', then P[i] is set to 0.***
