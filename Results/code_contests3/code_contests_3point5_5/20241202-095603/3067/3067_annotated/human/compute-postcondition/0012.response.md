Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, S is a string input, P is a list of size N+1 filled with 0. If i == 0, then P[0] is 0 and the program continues with the next iteration or step. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', then P[i] is updated with the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
