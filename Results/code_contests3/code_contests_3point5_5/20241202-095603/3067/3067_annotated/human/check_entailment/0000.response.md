Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values N, Q, S, and a list P. It then iterates through the string S to calculate values in the list P based on the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC'. Finally, for each query, it calculates and prints the number of occurrences of 'AC' within the specified substring range.

The program follows the constraints provided in the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
