Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for the length of the string, the queries, the string itself, and the query ranges.
2. It correctly initializes a list P with zeros for storing the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to each index.
3. It correctly iterates through the string and updates the P list based on the number of occurrences of 'AC'.
4. It correctly processes each query by subtracting the values at the specified ranges in the P list and prints the result.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
