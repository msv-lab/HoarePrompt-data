Postcondition: ***`flag` is True if there exists at least one pair of elements in list `c` such that the element at the current index is greater than the next element, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of this condition, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `flag` is True, the function maintains the same state with the previous values of `flag`, `pos`, and `n`. If `flag` is False, the function prints 'NO' and does not change the values of `pos` and `n`.***
