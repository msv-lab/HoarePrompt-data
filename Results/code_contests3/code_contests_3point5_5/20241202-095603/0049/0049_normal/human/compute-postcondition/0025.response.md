Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the input. It then iterates through the string and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the element at the current index is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the last occurrence of this condition in `pos`. Finally, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. It works under the assumption that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5 and `c` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
