Example Answer: 
The variable `n` is reassigned to the first element of the previous list `n`, which means it will now hold a single integer value. The previous list `n` is not accessible anymore. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the previous list after integer conversion.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the previous list after integer conversion**
