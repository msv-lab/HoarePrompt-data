According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2.
State: **`flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is 1**.
