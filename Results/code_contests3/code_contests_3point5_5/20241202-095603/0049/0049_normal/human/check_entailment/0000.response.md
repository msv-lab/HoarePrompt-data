Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the input. It then iterates through the string and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the element at the current index is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the last occurrence of this condition in `pos`. Finally, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it identifies if there is a pair of elements in the string where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it confirms that it is possible to reverse a substring to obtain a lexicographically less string. Otherwise, it correctly prints 'NO'. The code seems to handle all cases as per the problem description and the provided examples.
