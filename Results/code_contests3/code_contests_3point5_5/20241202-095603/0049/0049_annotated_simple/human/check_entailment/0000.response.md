Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input string and then iterates through the string to find the first occurrence where a character is greater than the next character. If such a pair is found, it sets the flag to True and stores the index of the first character in the pair. Then, it prints "YES" and the indices of the pair that needs to be reversed. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

This implementation covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
