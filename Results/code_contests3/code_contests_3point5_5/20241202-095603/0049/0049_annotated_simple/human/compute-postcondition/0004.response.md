According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the first element of the original list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 0 and `flag` is still False.
State: **`n` is the first element of the original list, `i` is 0, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
