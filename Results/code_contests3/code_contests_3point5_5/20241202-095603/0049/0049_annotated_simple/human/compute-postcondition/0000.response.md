Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, then `map(int, ...)` converts the input to integers. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is input integers converted to a list.
Output State: **`n` is input integers converted to a list**
