Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `pos` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the original list, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the original list, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
