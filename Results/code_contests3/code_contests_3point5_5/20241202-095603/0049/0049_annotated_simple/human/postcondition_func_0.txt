The function `func` reads input, processes it, and determines if there exists a pair of elements in the input list such that the element at the current index is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the elements. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
