Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly identifies if there is a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. It iterates through the string and checks if there is a character that is greater than the character following it. If such a character is found, it prints the indices of the characters that need to be reversed. It handles the cases where it is not possible to reverse any substring by setting the flag to False. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
