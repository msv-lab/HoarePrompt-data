Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks for a single decreasing pair of characters in the string `s`. However, the problem description requires finding a contiguous substring that can be reversed to make the entire string lexicographically less.

For example, if the input string is "abcb", the program will output "YES 2 3" which is incorrect. The correct output should be "YES 2 4" as reversing the substring "bc" will result in "aacb" which is lexicographically less than the original string "abcb".

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
