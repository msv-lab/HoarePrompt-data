Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func` that reads an integer `n` followed by a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates through the string to check if there exists a character in `c` that is greater than the next character. If such a case is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the characters involved. If no such case is found, it prints 'NO', which aligns with the problem description.

The program correctly determines if it is possible to reverse a substring of the given string to obtain a string that is lexicographically less. It prints "YES" and the indices of the substring to reverse if such a substring exists, and "NO" otherwise.
