Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` reads input from the user and splits it by spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each element of the input to an integer. The state of `s` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a list of integers based on user input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers based on user input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
