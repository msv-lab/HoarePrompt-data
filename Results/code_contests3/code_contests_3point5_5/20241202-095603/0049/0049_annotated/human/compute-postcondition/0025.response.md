Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` followed by a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates through the string to check if there exists a character in `c` that is greater than the next character. If such a case is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the characters involved. If no such case is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but works with the predefined values of `n` and `c`.**
