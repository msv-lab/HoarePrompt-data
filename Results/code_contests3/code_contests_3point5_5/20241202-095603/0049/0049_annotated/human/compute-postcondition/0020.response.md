Example Answer:
The code snippet prints `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. Since the value of `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, adding 1 and 2 to `pos` will give the indices of the elements following the last occurrence. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer based on the first element of the user input list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string based on the user input, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the first element of the user input list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string based on the user input, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, 'YES' is printed**
