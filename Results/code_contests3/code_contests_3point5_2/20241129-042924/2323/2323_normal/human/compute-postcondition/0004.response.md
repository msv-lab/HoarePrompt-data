According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `copya` has the same value as `a`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `a` should not be equal to 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` is not equal to 0.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 0, copya has the same value as a for the loop to execute the first time**
