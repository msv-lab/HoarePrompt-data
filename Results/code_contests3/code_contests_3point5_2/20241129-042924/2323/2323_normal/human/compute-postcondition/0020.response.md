Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a` modulo `b`. `a` is already computed using the new formula provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in Stepan's integer minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the result of `a` modulo 10. `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a` where `a` is the new value based on the calculation.
