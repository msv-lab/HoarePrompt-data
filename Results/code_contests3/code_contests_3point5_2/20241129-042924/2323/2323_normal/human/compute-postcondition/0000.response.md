Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The input is assumed to be within the constraints provided. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits (inclusive) and does not contain leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer.
