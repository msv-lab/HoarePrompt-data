Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Since `copya` is required to be a non-zero value for the loop to execute again, after division, if `copya` becomes 0, it will need to be updated to a non-zero value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 1, copya has a new value after being divided by 10 and for the loop to execute again copya is a non-zero value.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 1, copya has a new value after being divided by 10 and for the loop to execute again copya is a non-zero value**
