Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` are given, so `ans` will be the result of `a` modulo `b`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an input integer not equal to 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in Stepan's integer, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an input integer not equal to 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in Stepan's integer, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b**`.
