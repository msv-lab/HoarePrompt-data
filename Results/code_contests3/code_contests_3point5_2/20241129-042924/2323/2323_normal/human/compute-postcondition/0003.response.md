Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, and `a` is an input integer. Therefore, after execution, `copya` will have the same value as `a`. The state of other variables is not affected.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits (inclusive) and does not contain leading zeros; The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` has the same value as `a`**
