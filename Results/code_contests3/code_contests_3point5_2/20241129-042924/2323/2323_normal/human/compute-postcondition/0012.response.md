The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2. After execution, `c` becomes 3. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 3, copya has a new value after being divided by 10 and for the loop to execute again copya is a non-zero value.
