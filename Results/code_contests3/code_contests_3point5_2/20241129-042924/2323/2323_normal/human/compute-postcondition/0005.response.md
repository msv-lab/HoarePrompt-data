Example Answer:
copya is divided by 10. The value of copya is dependent on the value of a, which was an input integer not equal to 0. Therefore, after execution, copya will have a new value based on the division by 10. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 0, copya has a new value after being divided by 10**
