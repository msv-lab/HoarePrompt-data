Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an integer after integer division by 10 if `a` % 10 != 0 or `a` is assigned the value 10 if `a` % 10 == 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in Stepan's integer, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `h` is the last digit of `a`.***
