Example Answer:
`copya` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator `//`. The previous value of `copya` is unknown, but it will now have a new value after being divided by 10. The loop will execute again as long as `copya` is a non-zero value. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 2, copya has a new value after being divided by 10 and for the loop to execute again copya is a non-zero value.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 2, copya has a new value after being divided by 10 and for the loop to execute again copya is a non-zero value**
