Postcondition: ***Stepan's integer is a positive integer, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in Stepan's integer, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the result of `a` modulo `b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated to `10` and `c` is decreased by 1. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`.***
