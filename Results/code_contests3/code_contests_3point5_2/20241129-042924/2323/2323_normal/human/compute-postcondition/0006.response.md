Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 1, copya has a new value after being divided by 10.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer, m is an integer between 2 and 10^8, a is an input integer not equal to 0, b is an input integer, c is 1, copya has a new value after being divided by 10**
