Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts of the integer and finds the minimum remainder. The logic seems to be correct and the program should work as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
