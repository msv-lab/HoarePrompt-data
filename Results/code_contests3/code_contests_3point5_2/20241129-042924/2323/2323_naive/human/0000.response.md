Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly computes the minimum remainder of the division by the given number `m` among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible good shifts by shifting the integer to the right and calculates the remainder after division by `m`. The program then updates the minimum remainder found so far. This logic covers all potential cases and correctly implements the problem description.
