According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is the same as `a`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to be truthy (not equal to 0).
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` is truthy (not equal to 0)**
