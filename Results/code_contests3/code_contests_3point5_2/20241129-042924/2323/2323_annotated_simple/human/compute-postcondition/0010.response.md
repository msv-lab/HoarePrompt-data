According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10, so for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10 and for the loop to execute again `copya` needs to be greater than 0**
