Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to the result of dividing `a` by 10 using integer division. Since the initial value of `a` is 10, after execution, `a` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the remainder of dividing `a` by 10, `a` is now 1, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`h` is the remainder of dividing `a` by 10, `a` is now 1, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain unchanged**
