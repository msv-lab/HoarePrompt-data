Example Answer:
The value of `a` is divided by 10 using the `//` operator, which means the remainder is removed. As `h` was initially assigned the value of `a % 10`, it is essentially the last digit of the original `a`. After the division, `a` no longer contains that last digit, so the value of `h` changes accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`h` is the last digit of the original `a` after removing it, other variables remain unchanged**
