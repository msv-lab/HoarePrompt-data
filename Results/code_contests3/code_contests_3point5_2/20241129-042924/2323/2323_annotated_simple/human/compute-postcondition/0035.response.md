According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is updated to 10 and the values of `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain unchanged.
- If `a % 10 == 0`, then `a` is also updated to 10 and the values of `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain unchanged.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: `a` is 10, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `c`.
