Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the remainder of dividing `a` by 10, `a` is now a multiple of 10 times `h`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`h` is the remainder of dividing `a` by 10, `a` is now a multiple of 10 times `h`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged**
