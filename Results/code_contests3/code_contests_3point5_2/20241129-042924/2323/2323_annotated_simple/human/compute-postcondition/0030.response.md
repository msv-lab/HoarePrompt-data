Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and the result of `a % b`. Here, `a` is 11 and `b` is `c`, which is equal to `c`. So, `a % b` is equivalent to 11 % `c`, which will result in an error since you cannot perform modulo operation on a string. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is 11, `b` is `c`, `c` is `c`, `copya` is 10, `ans` is `c`, `i` is `c`, `h` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is 11, `b` is `c`, `c` is `c`, `copya` is 10, `ans` is `c`, `i` is `c`, `h` is 1**
