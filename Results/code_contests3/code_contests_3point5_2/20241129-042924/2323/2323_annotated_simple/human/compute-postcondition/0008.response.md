Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by integer division of `copya` by 10. The loop will continue as long as `copya` is greater than 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10 for the loop to execute again `copya` needs to be greater than 0**
