Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integer inputs `a` and `b`, calculates the number of digits in `a` and then performs a series of operations on `a` and `b` based on the digits of `a`. It finds the minimum value of `a % b` for all iterations and prints the result. However, the code does not handle cases where `b` is 0, which could result in a division by zero error.**
