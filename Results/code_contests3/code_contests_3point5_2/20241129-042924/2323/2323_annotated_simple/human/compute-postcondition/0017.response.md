The value of `h` is assigned as the remainder of `a` divided by 10. The last digit of `a` is extracted and stored in `h`. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will contain a non-zero digit. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `h` contains the last non-zero digit of `a`**
