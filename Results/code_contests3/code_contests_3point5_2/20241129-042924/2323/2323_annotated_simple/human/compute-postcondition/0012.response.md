Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10 and for the loop to execute again, `copya` needs to be greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10 and for the loop to execute again, `copya` needs to be greater than 0**
