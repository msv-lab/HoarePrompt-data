Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are known as input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b**`
