Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is updated to 10 and `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10. Otherwise, `a` is updated to 10 and `h` is the last digit of the modified `a`. In both cases, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged.***
