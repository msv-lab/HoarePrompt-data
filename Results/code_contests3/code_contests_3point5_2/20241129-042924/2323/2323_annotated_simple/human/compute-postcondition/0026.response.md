According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the value of `c - 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to `c` and no other variables need to be modified.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` is `c`, `h` are integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated to 10. Otherwise, `a` is updated to 10**
