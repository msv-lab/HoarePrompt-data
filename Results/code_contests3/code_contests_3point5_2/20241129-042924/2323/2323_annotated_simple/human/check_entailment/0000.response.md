Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

The issue lies in the for loop where the program tries to find the minimum remainder by shifting the integer. The logic inside the loop is incorrect and does not consider all possible good shifts of the integer. The program should be rotating the digits of the integer to find all possible good shifts and then calculate the remainder for each shift.

To fix the program, the logic inside the for loop needs to be changed to correctly calculate all good shifts of the integer and then find the minimum remainder.
