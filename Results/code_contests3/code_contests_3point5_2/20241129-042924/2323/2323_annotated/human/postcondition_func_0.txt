The function `func` reads two integer inputs `a` and `b`, calculates the number of digits in `a`, and then iterates through each digit of `a` to update its value based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the minimum value of `a % b` encountered during the iterations. The function does not accept any parameters and focuses on integer manipulation based on the input values.
