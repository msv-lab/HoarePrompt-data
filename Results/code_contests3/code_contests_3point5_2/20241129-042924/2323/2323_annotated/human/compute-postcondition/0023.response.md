Output State: **`a` is the input integer without the last digit, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a` reduced by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is the value of the new last digit of `a` after taking the modulo operation with 10**
