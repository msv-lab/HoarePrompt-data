Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a` modulo `b`. The previous values of the variables are known, so the new value of `ans` will be the minimum between the current value of `ans` and the result of `a` modulo `b`. 
Output State: **`a` is `a` integer after dividing by 10, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` is an integer, `i`, `h` are integers. `c` is the number of digits in `a` after division, `copya` is 0, `i` is 0**
