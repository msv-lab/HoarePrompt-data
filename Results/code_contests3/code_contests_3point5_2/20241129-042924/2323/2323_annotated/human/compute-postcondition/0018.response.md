Output State: `a` is `a` integer after dividing by 10, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. `c` is the number of digits in `a` after division, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, `i` is 0. The loop will continue as long as `c` is greater than 0. The last digit of `a` after division is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a` after performing the modulo operation.
