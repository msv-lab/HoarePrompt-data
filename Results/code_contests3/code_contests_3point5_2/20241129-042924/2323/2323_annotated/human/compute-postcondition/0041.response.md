Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a` floor divided by 10. The value of `h` is already calculated as `a % 10`, so after execution, `a` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers and `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers and `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`**
