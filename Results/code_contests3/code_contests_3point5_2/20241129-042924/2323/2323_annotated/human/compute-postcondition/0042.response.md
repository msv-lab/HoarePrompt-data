Example Answer:
The value of `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which means `h` will store the last digit of `a`. Then, `a` is updated to `10 ** c` times `h` plus the previous value of `a`. The variables `b`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are integers, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated as described.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are integers, `h` is the last digit of `a`, `a` is updated as described**
