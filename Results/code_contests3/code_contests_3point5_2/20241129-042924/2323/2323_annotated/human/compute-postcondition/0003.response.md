Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, and `a` is an input integer. Therefore, after execution, `copya` will have the same value as `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same value as `a`**
