Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the result of `a % b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `a % b`, `i`, `h` remain integers**
