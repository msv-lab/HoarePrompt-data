Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The input integer provided to Stepan is a positive integer without leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: The input integer provided to Stepan is a positive integer without leading zeros. The integer m is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; `a` is the input integer.
Output State: **The input integer provided to Stepan is a positive integer without leading zeros. The integer m is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; `a` is the input integer.**
