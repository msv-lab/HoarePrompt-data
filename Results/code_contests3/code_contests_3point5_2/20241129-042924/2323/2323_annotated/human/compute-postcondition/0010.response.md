According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is not equal to 0. To execute the loop one more time, the `copya` variable needs to be adjusted to not equal to 0.
State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0**
