Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are known, so the value of `ans` can be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`**
