Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated to the integer value after dividing by 10, `c` is decreased by 1. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is reassigned the value 10, `copya` remains 0, `ans` remains the result of `a` modulo `b`, `i` remains 0, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`.**
