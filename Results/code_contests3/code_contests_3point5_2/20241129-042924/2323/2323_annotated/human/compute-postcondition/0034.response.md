Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is updated to the integer value after dividing by 10 and `c` is decreased by 1. If `a % 10 == 0`, then `a` is reassigned the value 10, `copya` remains 0, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current `ans` and `a % b`, `i` remains 0, and `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`.***
