Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `copya` divided by 10. The initial value of `copya` is the same as `a`, so if `a` is a non-zero integer, after execution `copya` will be the integer division of `a` by 10. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the integer division of `a` by 10.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the integer division of `a` by 10**
