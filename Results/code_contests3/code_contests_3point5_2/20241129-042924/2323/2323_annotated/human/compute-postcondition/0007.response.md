According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is the integer division of `a` by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0**
