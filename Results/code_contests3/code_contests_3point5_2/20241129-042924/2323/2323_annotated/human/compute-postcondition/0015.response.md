According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `c`. If `c` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start, `copya` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
