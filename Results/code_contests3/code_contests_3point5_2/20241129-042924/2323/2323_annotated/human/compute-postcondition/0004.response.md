According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is a truthy value (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `copya` is the same value as `a`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `a` should be a non-zero integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same value as `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should be a non-zero integer**
