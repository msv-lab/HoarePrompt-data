Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a` floor divided by 10. Since the initial state of `a` is an integer, the result will also be an integer. Therefore, after execution, `a` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`a` is an updated integer, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` remain integers**
