Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated after performing integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated after performing integer division by 10**
