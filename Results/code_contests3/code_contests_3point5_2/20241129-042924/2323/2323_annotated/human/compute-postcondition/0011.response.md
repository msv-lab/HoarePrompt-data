Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, which means removing the last digit of `copya`. The value of `copya` will be updated accordingly. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated after performing integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is not equal to 0, `copya` is updated after performing integer division by 10**
