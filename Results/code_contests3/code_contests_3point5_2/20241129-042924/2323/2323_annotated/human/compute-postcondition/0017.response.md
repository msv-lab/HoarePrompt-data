Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. `c` is the number of digits in `a`. `copya` is 0. `ans` is the result of `a` modulo `b`. For the loop to execute the first time, `c` is greater than 0. `i` is 0. The last digit of `a` is not 0. `h` is the last digit of `a` after performing the modulo operation.**
