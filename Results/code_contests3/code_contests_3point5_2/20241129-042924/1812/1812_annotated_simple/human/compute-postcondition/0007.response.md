Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f'; `N` is the row number of Vasya's seat, `C` is the ASCII value of the character `s` in Vasya's seat string minus the ASCII value of 'a'; `M` is calculated as `N - 1 & 3`. If `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` is decreased by `M`. After executing `M ^= 3`, the new value of `M` is calculated.**
