Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value from user input using `gets()`, which represents Vasya's seat. The format of Vasya's seat is a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in the row. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is represented as a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in the row.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in the row**
