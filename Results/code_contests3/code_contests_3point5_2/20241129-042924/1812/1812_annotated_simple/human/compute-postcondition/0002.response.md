Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value obtained by taking all characters of the string `S` except the last one. Given that `S` represents Vasya's seat in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `N` will be the row number of Vasya's seat. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is represented as a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f'; `N` is the row number of Vasya's seat.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as a string in the format `ns`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f'; `N` is the row number of Vasya's seat**
