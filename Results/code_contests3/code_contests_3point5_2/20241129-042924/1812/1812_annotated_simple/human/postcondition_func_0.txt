The function `func` reads Vasya's seat representation as a string in the format ns, where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and s is a character from 'a' to 'f' representing the seat in the row. It then calculates a value based on the row number and seat character, but it lacks a return statement. The outcome of the calculation is printed.
