Output State: **`S` is the input string value from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the ASCII value of the last character of `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `M` is the result of `(N - 1) & 3` and is either 1 or 2. If `M` is in (1, 2), `N` is incremented by `M`. The final result of the code snippet is printed.**
