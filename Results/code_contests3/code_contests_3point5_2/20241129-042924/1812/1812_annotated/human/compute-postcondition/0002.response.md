Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value of `S` excluding the last character. The value of `S` is the input string value from `gets()`, so `N` is the integer value of `S` without the last character. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is assigned the input string value from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value of `S` excluding the last character.
Output State: **`S` is assigned the input string value from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value of `S` excluding the last character**
