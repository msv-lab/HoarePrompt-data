The function `func` reads a string input in the format "ns" where n is an integer representing the row number and s is a character representing the seat in the row. It then calculates and prints a value based on the input. However, the annotations mention postconditions that are not consistent with the actual code execution. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
