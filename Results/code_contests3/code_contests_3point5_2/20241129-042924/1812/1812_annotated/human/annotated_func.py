#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of a string in the format "ns", where n is an integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').
def func():
    gets = lambda r=sys.stdin.readline: r().strip()
    S = gets()
    N = int(S[:-1])
    C = ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')
    M = N - 1 & 3
    if (M in (1, 2)) :
        N -= M
        M ^= 3
        N += M
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`S` is the input string value from `gets()`, `N` is an integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the ASCII value of the last character of `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `M` is the result of `(N - 1) & 3` and is either 1 or 2. If `M` is in (1, 2), `N` is incremented by `M`.
    print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a string input in the format "ns" where n is an integer representing the row number and s is a character representing the seat in the row. It then calculates and prints a value based on the input. However, the annotations mention postconditions that are not consistent with the actual code execution. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
