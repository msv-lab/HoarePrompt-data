Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user, N is an integer derived from S excluding the last character, C is an integer calculated from the last character of S, M is either 1 or 2. If M is in (1, 2), N is updated by adding M, s remains a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S remains the input received from the user, C remains the same, M is updated to either 2 or 1, print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)) is executed.**
