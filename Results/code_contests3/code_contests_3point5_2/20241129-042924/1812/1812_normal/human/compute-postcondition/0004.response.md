Example Answer:
M is assigned the value of N - 1, where N is derived from the input S excluding the last character. The value of C is calculated from the last character of S. M is then bitwise ANDed with 3. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user, N is an integer derived from S excluding the last character, C is an integer calculated from the last character of S, M is the result of (N - 1) & 3.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user, N is an integer derived from S excluding the last character, C is an integer calculated from the last character of S, M is the result of (N - 1) & 3**
