Example Answer: 
`S` is assigned the value returned by `gets()`. The value of `S` depends on the input received from the user. The value of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user**
