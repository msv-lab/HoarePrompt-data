Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline` and strip any leading or trailing whitespace characters. The function is not directly affecting the variables `n` and `s`, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer and s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'.**
