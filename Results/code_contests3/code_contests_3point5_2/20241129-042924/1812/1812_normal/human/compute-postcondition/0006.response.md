Example Answer:
`N` is decremented by `M`, where `M` is either 1 or 2. The value of `M` does not change the result as `N` is decremented by either 1 or 2. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user, N is an integer derived from S excluding the last character, C is an integer calculated from the last character of S, M is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, s is a character 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', S is the input received from the user, N is an integer derived from S excluding the last character, C is an integer calculated from the last character of S, M is either 1 or 2**
