The function `func` reads an input string `S` from the user, extracts an integer `N` from the string excluding the last character, calculates an integer `C` based on the last character of the string, and then performs various arithmetic operations on `N` and `C`. It prints the result of these operations. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value.
