According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the input string needs to be considered.
State: **`pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i` for the next character in the input string**
