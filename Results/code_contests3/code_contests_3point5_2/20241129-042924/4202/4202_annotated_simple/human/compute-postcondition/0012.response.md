Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'. The value of `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string. Therefore, after execution, `pb` will be incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. 
Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '1'**
