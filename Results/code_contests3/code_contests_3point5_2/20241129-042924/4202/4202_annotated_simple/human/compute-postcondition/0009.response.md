According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the input string. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input string. 

For the loop to execute:
- `pa` should be the total count of '1's in the input string.
- `pb` should remain 0.
- `i` should represent the current character being iterated over in the input string.

State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` represents the current character in the input string**
