Example Answer:
The code prints 'NO' if the total count of '1's in the input string represented by `pa` is greater than or equal to the total count of '1's represented by `pb`, otherwise it prints 'YES'. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is the total count of '1's in the input string and the program prints either 'NO' or 'YES'.
Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is the total count of '1's in the input string and the program prints either 'NO' or 'YES'**
