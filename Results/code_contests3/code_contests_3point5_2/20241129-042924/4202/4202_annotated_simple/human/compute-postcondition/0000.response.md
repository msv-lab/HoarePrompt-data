Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not affected, the Output State is: a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000; `pa` is 0**
