Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is increased by 1 if the next character in the input string is '1', otherwise, it remains the same. The initial state of `pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i` for the next character in the input string.
Output State: **`pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i` for the next character in the input string**
