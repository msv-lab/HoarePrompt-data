According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input provided by the user. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as there is at least one character to process. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `pa` is 1 and i is the first character in the input string.
State: **`pa` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in the input string**
