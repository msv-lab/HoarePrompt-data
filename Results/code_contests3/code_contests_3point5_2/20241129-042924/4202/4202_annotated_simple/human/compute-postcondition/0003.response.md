According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is either 1 or 2. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be more input available after the previous iteration.
State: **`pa` is either 1 or 2, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more input available**
