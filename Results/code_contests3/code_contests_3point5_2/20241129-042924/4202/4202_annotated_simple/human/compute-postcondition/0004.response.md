Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 only if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous values of `pa` and `i` are unknown, so the final value of `pa` depends on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i`.
Output State: **`pa` is either increased by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `i`**
