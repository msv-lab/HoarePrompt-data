Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 1 and `i` is the first character in the input string. Depending on the value of `i`, `pa` will either remain 1 or become 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`pa` is either 1 or 2**
