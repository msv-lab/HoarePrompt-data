The function `func` takes no parameters but operates on two strings `a` and `b`, which consist only of "0" and "1" characters with lengths between 1 and 1000. It calculates the total count of '1's in both strings and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in string `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in string `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
