Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of '1's in both strings 'a' and 'b', then prints "YES" if the count of '1's in 'a' is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in 'b', and "NO" otherwise. This matches the problem description where the program needs to determine if it is possible to turn string 'a' into string 'b' based on the counts of '1's in the strings. The program uses the parity concept correctly to make this determination.
