Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the next character `i` in the input string is '1'. The initial state indicates that `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input string, and `i` represents the next character. Therefore, after execution, `pb` will be updated based on the occurrence of '1' in the next character.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of '1' characters in the remaining input string, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the updated number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input string**
