According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. Since the loop is based on the input string, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `a` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `b` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `pa` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is the first character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`.
State: **`a` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `b` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `pa` is 0, `i` is the first character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()` for the loop to execute the first time**
