Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state of `pa` is 0 and `i` is the first character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. Therefore, if the first character of the input string is '1', `pa` will be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`a` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `b` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`**
