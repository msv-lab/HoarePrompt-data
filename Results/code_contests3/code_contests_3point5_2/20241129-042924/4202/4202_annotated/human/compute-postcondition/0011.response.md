According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. If there are more characters left in the input string, the loop will execute another time. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the input string from `raw_input()` must have more characters left to process.

State: **`pa` is the number of '1' characters in the remaining input string from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input string**
