Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state shows that `pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same as in the initial state, and `pb` is 0. After the execution of the code, the value of `pb` will increase by 1 if `i` is '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `i`**
