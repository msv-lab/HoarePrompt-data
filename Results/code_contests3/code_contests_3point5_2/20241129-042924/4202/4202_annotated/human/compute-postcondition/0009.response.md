According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. Since we don't have specific information about the input string, we cannot adjust the states based on the exact values of `a` and `b`. However, we know that `pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string initially.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`pa` is the number of '1' characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`, `a` and `b` remain the same as in the initial state, `pb` is 0**.
