According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string from `raw_input()`. If there are more characters remaining in the input string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `b` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character in the input string. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters left in the input string.
State: **`a` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `b` is a string consisting of only "0" and "1" characters with at least one character, `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next character in the input string from `raw_input()`**
