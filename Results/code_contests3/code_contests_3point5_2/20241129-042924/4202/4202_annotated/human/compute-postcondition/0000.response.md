Example Answer: 
`pa` is assigned the value `0`. Since no other variables are affected in this code snippet, the output state is: a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, and 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000; `pa` is 0**
