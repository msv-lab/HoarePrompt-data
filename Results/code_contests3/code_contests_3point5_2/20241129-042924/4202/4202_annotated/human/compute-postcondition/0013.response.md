According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters remaining in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is the number of '1' characters in the remaining input string, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the updated number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters remaining in the input string.
State: **`pa` is the number of '1' characters in the remaining input string, `a` and `b` remain the same, `pb` is the updated number of occurrences of '1' in the next character in the input string, for the loop to execute another time, there must be more characters remaining in the input string**
