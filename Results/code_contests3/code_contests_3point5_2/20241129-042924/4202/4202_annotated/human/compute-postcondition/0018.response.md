Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It calculates the number of occurrences of '1' characters in two input strings obtained from `raw_input()`, stored in variables `pa` and `pb`. Then, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1' characters in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function works with input strings `a` and `b`, where each string consists only of "0" and "1" characters, and each string has a length between 1 and 1000 characters. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
