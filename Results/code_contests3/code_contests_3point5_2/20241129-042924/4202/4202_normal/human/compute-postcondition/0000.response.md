Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is 0**
