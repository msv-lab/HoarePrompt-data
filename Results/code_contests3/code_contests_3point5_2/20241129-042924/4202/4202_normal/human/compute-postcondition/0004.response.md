The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the next character `i` in the input is '1'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are not affected. Since `pa` is either 0 or 1, after execution, `pa` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1, the input is not empty and `i` is the next character in the input, `pa` is either 1 or 2**
