Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 0, and `i` is the first character in the input. Therefore, if the first character of the input is '1', `pa` will be 1, otherwise, it will remain 0. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute the first time the input is not empty and `i` is the first character in the input**
