According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1, the input is not empty and `i` is the last character processed in the input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must still not be empty and `i` should be the next character in the input.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is either 0 or 1, the input is not empty and `i` is the next character in the input**
