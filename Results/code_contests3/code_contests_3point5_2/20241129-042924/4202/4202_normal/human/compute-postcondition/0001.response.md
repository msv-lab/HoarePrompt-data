According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input should not be empty. Since the input is read character by character, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0. So for the loop to execute the first time, the input should not be empty and `i` is the first character in the input.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 01-characters with lengths between 1 and 1000, `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input is not empty and `i` is the first character in the input**
