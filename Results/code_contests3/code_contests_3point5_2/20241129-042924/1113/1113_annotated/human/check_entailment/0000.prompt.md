You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a correct solution of the sudoku puzzle. If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it [here](http://tiny.cc/636xmz).

The picture showing the correct sudoku solution:

<image>

Blocks are bordered with bold black color.

Your task is to change at most 9 elements of this field (i.e. choose some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 9 and change the number at the position (i, j) to any other number in range [1; 9]) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the 9 × 9 field, in which:

  * Any number in this field is in range [1; 9]; 
  * each row contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each column contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each 3 × 3 block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements. 



It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 9 lines, each line consists of 9 characters from 1 to 9 without any whitespaces — the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — the initial field with at most 9 changed elements so that the obtained field is anti-sudoku. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits, `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after all iterations, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is `T`, `i` is 9, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` contains the final modified `nRow` after all iterations, `nRow` is not an empty string, and `nRow` has been completely modified based on the condition of `i` in each iteration of the loop.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func processes a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9 by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the grid. The modified rows are stored in a list `res`. The function does not accept any parameters and redirects the standard output to write the modified grid. The specific operation performed on the grid is to replace '9' with '1' in each row.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
