Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly processes each test case consisting of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9. It replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the grid and stores the modified rows in a list `res`. The function then prints the modified grid. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description, which asks to change at most 9 elements in the sudoku solution to make it an anti-sudoku.

The program ensures that each row contains at least two equal elements by changing '9' to '1'. It does not change more than 9 elements per test case, which is a requirement for an anti-sudoku. Hence, the program is correct and meets the problem description.
