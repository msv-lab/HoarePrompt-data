According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a list with '1' replacing all occurrences of '9', `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`. For the loop to execute again, `row` should not be empty. If the last element in `row` is '9', `nRow` will contain '1' and be appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i` and then appended to `res`.
State: **`nRow` is a list with '1' replacing all occurrences of '9', `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`, for the loop to execute again `row` is not empty, `i` is the last element in `row`**.
