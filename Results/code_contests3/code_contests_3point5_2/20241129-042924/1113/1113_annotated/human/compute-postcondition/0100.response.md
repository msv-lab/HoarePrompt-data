Example Answer:
The string `nRow` is concatenated with the character '1'. If the previous value of `nRow` is 'abc', then after execution, `nRow` becomes 'abc1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated to 'abc1', `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated to 'abc1', `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged**
