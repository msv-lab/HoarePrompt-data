Example Answer:
`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. The other variables and functions remain unchanged.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits. `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input. `maxint` is positive infinity**
