According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is the modified `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', `res` contains the final modified `nRow` and the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than 9.
State: **`nRow` is the modified `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', `res` contains the final modified `nRow` and the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row` incremented by 1, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9**
