Example Answer:
After each iteration, '1' is added to `nRow`. Since the loop needs to run for 9 times, after 9 iterations, `nRow` will have 9 '1's appended to it. As each '9' in `row` is replaced with '1' in `res`, and the loop runs for 9 times, all '9's in `row` will be replaced with '1's in `res`. The value of `i` is not affected by the given code. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has 9 '1's appended, `res` has the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute the first time it will need to run 9 times, the first element of `row` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` has 9 '1's appended, `res` has the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute the first time it will need to run 9 times, the first element of `row` is '9'**
