Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string with 10 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute the first time it will need to run 9 times. Regardless of the condition, the state of the variables remains the same after the execution of the if else block.***
