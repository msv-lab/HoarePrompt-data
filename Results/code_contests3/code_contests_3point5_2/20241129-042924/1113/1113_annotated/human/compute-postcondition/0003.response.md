Example Answer:
The `write` variable is assigned the value `sys.stdout.write`. This means that the `write` variable now refers to the `write` method of `sys.stdout`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits. `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input.**
