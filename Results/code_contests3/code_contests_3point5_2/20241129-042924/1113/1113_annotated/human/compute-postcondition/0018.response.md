Output State: **`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits, `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is assigned the value of `i` if `i` is not '9', otherwise `nRow` is '11'**
