According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `row` and `nRow`. If the first element of `row` is '9', the loop will execute 9 times with modifications to `nRow`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is the final modified string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations. If the first element of `row` is not '9', `nRow` contains the elements of `row` without any modifications. So for the loop to be executed one more time:
State: **`nRow` is a string with 9 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute the first time it will need to run 9 times**
