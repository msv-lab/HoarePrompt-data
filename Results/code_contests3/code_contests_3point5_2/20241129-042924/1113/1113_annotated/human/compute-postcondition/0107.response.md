Example Answer:
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the next element in `row`, `res` will accumulate all modifications made including the appended `nRow`, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` is 2.
Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the next element in `row`, `res` will accumulate all modifications made including the appended `nRow`, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` is 2**
