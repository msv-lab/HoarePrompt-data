Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its existing value. The value of `i` is not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, so the loop will execute multiple times. The `row` variable is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated by adding '1', `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated by adding '1', `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` remains unchanged**
