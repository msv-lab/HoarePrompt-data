Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string, `res` contains the final modified `nRow` and the modified `nRow` appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row` incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1'. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` appended with the value of `i`.***
