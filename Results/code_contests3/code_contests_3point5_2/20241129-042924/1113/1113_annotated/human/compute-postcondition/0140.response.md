Example Answer:
`nRow` is now a string with 11 '1's appended at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string with 11 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the second element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 elements.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string with 11 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the second element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 elements**
