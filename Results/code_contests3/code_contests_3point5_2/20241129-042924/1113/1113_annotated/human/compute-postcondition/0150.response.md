Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. Since `nRow` was initially empty, after execution, `nRow` will contain '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains '1', `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` will be appended to `res`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is the last element in `row`, and the last element in `row` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains '1', `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` will be appended to `res`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is the last element in `row`, and the last element in `row` is '9'**
