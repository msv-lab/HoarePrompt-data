Postcondition: ***`nRow` is the result of the first element in row concatenated with '1' if i == '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the sum of the first element in row and itself. In both cases, `i` remains the first element in row, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, and for the loop to execute, row must not be empty.***
