Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is the first element in `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, the value of `i` is not '9'***
