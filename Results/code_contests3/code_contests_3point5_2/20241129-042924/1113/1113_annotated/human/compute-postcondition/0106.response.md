Example Answer: 
`row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes an input and removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. The occurrences of '9' in `row` are replaced by '1' to get `nRow`. The next element in `row` is assigned to `i`. The modifications made are accumulated in `res`, which will contain all the changes, including the appended `nRow`. `T` remains unchanged, and `t` is set to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` will contain the string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the next element in `row`, `res` will accumulate all modifications made including the appended `nRow`, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` is 2.
Output State: **`nRow` will contain the string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1' in the original `row` string, `i` is the next element in `row`, `res` will accumulate all modifications made including the appended `nRow`, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` is 2**
