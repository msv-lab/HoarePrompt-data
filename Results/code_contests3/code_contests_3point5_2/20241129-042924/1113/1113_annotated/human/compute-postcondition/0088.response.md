Example Answer: 
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: After the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `i` will be the next element in `row` to be processed, `res` will continue to accumulate the modifications, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` will still be 2, `nRow` is an empty string.
