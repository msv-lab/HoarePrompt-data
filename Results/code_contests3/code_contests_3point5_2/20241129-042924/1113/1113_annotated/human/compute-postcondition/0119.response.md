Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. Since the initial state of `nRow` is dependent on the first element in row, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the content of `row`. The variables `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. The loop will continue to execute as long as row is not empty. 
Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the first element in row, `i` remains the first element in row, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, loop continues to execute as long as row is not empty**
