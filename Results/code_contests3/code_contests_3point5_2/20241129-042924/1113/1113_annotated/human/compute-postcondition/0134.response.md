Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string with 9 '1's appended if the first element of `row` is '9'. `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations. `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute the first time it will need to run 9 times. If the first element of `row` is not '9', `nRow` contains the elements of `row` without any modifications.***
