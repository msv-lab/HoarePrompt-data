Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' if `i` is equal to '9', and it will have '1' appended to it. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will be updated with the string after appending the character `i` at the end. `i` will be the first element in `row`, `res` will continue to accumulate modifications, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` will be 2, and `nRow` will contain the necessary modifications based on the conditions met.***
