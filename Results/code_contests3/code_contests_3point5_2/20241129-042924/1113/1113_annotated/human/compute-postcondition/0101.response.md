Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `nRow` is incremented by `i`, `nRow`, `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`nRow` is incremented by `i`, `nRow`, `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged**
