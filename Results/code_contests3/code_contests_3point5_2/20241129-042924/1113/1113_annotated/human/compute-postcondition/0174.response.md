Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, so the condition holds true. `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'. 
Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'**
