Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits, `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 1 higher than the previous value, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be 1 higher than the previous value, `row` is assigned the stripped input string, `nRow` is updated to match the replacement criteria. Additionally, `i` is equal to '9'***
