According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is determined based on the first element in the row and the value of `i`, `i` remains the first element in the row, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the row must not be empty. 
State: **`nRow` is updated based on the first element in row, `i` remains the first element in row, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute row must not be empty**
