Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to `nRow` at each iteration. Since `i` is the first element in `row` and `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` will start building up with the elements of `row`. The loop will iterate 9 times, and each time `i` will be added to `nRow`. After 9 iterations, all occurrences of '9' in `row` will be replaced with '1' in `res`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', there will be no change in `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the elements of `row`, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the elements of `row`, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element, `i` is not equal to '9'**
