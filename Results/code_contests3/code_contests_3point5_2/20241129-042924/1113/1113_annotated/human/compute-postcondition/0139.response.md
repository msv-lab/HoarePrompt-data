According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. Since the loop needs to run 9 times, the loop will execute the first time regardless of the content of `row`.

At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string with 10 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the first element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 1 element.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`nRow` is a string with 10 '1's appended, `res` is the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` is the second element in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 elements**
