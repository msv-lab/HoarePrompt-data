Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`, which is incremented by 1 each time and is less than 9. The value of `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9; `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9; `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'**
