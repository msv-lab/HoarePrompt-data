According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow`, `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the conditions need to be checked, and if `i` is not equal to '9', the loop will execute again with the same state.
State: **`nRow`, `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged**
