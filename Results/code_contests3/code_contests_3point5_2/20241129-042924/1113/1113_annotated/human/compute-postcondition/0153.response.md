Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a list with '1' replacing all occurrences of '9', `res` contains the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is the last element in `row`. If the last element in `row` is '9', `nRow` will contain '1' and be appended to `res`. Otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i` and then appended to `res`.***
