According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row`. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` is defined as the last element in `row`, it needs to be adjusted to the actual last element in `row`. 
State: **`nRow` is empty, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` will be appended to `res`, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `i` is the last element in `row`**
