Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a list with '1' replacing all occurrences of '9'. If `i` is equal to '9', an extra '1' is concatenated at the end of `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the last element in `nRow` is added to `nRow`. `res` contains the final modified `nRow` in both cases. `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`. For the loop to execute again, `row` must not be empty, and `i` remains the last element in `row`.***
