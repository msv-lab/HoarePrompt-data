According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables in the state provided. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states were observed:
- `nRow` is a string.
- If `i` is '9', `nRow` is '1'.
- If `i` is the first element in `row`.
- `res` is empty.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `t` is 2.
- For the loop to execute, `row` is not empty.
- If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is the first element in `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, the value of `i` is not '9'.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `i` is '9', change `nRow` to '1'.
- If `i` is not '9', update the value of `nRow` to be the first element in `row`.
- Ensure that `row` is not empty.

State: **`nRow` is the first element in `row`, `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty.**
