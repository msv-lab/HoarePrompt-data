Example Answer: 
`row` is assigned the input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variables `nRow`, `i`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `i` will be the next element in `row` to be processed, `res` will continue to accumulate the modifications, `T` will remain unchanged, `t` will still be 2.
