According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row`. If `row` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Also, `i` is the next element in `row` indicates that `i` should be the first element in `row` for the loop to execute. Additionally, `res` will accumulate modifications including the appended `nRow`, so `res` should be empty. `T` will remain unchanged, so it should be the same. Finally, `t` is 2 does not impact the loop execution, so it remains the same.
State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` is empty, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
