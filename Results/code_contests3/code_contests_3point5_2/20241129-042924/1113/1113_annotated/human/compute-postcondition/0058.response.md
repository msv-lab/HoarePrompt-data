Postcondition: ***`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits, `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is either '9' or not, `row` is the stripped input string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` contains `nRow` for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` is not an empty string, `nRow` has been modified based on the condition of `i`, `nRow` has '1' appended to it if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` has been appended with the value of `i`***
