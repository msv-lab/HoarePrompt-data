Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 and checked if it is less than 9. The loop will keep executing until `i` reaches 9. The variable `row` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than 9, `row` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' for the loop to execute another time**
