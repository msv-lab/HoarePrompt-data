According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are present:
- `nRow` has been updated based on the conditions met.
- `i` is the first element in `row`.
- `res` has accumulated modifications.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `t` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `nRow` should contain the necessary modifications based on the conditions met in the previous iteration.
- `i` should be the next element in `row`.
- `res` should continue to accumulate modifications.
- `T` should remain unchanged.
- `t` should stay as 2.

State: **`nRow` contains necessary modifications, `i` is the next element in `row`, `res` continues to accumulate modifications, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2**
