According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `nRow` will contain the modified string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`.
2. `res` will contain the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations.
3. `i` will be the last element in `row`.
4. `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1'.

State: **`nRow` will contain the modified string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', for the loop to execute it will need to run 9 times**
