Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`, which already contains the final modified `nRow`. The value of `i` is 9 and `row` is the stripped input string. After execution, the `res` list now contains the final modified `nRow` twice.
Output State: **`nRow` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', `res` contains the final modified `nRow` twice, `i` is 9, `row` is the stripped input string**
