Output State: **`sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called, `input` is reassigned, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is the stripped input string with at least one '9' to be replaced with '1', `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` and appending '1' at the end, `nRow` has been completely modified based on the condition of `i` in each iteration of the loop, `row` contains the stripped input string, `nRow` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the modified string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' or `i` is concatenated at the end based on the condition in each iteration of the loop, `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**
