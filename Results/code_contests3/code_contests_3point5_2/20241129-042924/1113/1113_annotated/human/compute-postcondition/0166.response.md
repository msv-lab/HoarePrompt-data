Example Answer:
The variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables remain the same as their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the final modified `nRow` and the modified `nRow` appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row` incremented by 1, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input string.
