According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` will be a string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1' in `row`, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` will be appended to `res`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`nRow` will be a string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1' in `row` after 10 iterations, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` will be appended to `res`**
