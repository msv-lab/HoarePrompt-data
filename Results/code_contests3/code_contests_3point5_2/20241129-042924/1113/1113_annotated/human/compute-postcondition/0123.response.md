Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The value of `nRow` is the result of concatenating '1' to all occurrences of '9' in `row`, otherwise, `nRow` remains the same as `row`. The values of `i`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2.
Output State: **`nRow` is appended to `res`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2**
