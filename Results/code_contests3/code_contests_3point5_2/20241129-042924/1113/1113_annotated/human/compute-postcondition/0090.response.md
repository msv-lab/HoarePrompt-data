Postcondition: ***After the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` continues to accumulate modifications, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, and `nRow` is an empty string. Additionally, if `i` is equal to '9', then the state of the program will be as described above.***
