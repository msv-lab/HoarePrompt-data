Example Answer:
Adding `nRow` to `res` appends the modified `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous values of `res`, `nRow`, and other variables are not provided, so the output state is: `nRow` will be a string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`nRow` will be a string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1' in `row` after 9 iterations, `res` will contain the final modified `nRow`, `i` will be the last element in `row`, `row` will be the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', and the modified `nRow` is appended to `res`**
