Example Answer:
`nRow` will have '1' appended to it after the next iteration of the loop. The updated state of the program would be: After the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` continues to accumulate modifications, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, and `nRow` will have '1' appended to it.
Output State: **After the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` will be updated with the string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `i` is the first element in `row`, `res` continues to accumulate modifications, `T` remains unchanged, `t` is 2, and `nRow` will have '1' appended to it.**
