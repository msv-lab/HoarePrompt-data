Output State: `sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`, `atexit.register` function is called to write the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output using `os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue())` when the program exits, `input` is reassigned to a byte stream read from standard input, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the final modified `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` after all iterations, `T` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is `T`, `i` is 9, `row` is the stripped input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced with '1', `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` contains the final modified `nRow` after all iterations, `nRow` is not an empty string, and `nRow` has been completely modified based on the condition of `i` in each iteration of the loop.
