Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1'. Since `nRow` already contains a modified version of `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be the modified version of `row` with '1' added at the end. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not involved in the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and '1' added at the end, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and '1' added at the end, `i` is not equal to '9'**
