Example Answer:
The variable `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and `i` is not equal to '9'**
