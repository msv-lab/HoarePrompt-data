Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index after all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `i` is the last character in `row` that was processed and it is not equal to '9', and `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i` if the condition i == '9' is false. If the condition i == '9' is true, `nRow` is updated with the addition of '1'.***
