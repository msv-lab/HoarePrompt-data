Example Answer:
The modified version of `row` called `nRow` is appended at the end of the list `res`. The loop or iteration logic that generates `nRow` is not provided, so we can assume that `nRow` is already prepared with all '9's replaced with '1's. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is the last element in `row`, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is the last element in `row`, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed**
