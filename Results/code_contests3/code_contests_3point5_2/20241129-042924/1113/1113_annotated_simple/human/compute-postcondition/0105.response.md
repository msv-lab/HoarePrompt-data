According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times, starting from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 8 which is the last element in `row`, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`, and `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 9, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row`, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed**
