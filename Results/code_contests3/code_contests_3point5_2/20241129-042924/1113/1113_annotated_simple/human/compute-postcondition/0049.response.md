According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the input string `row`. Before the loop starts, `nRow` contains modified version of `row`, so it needs to be adjusted to mention that `row` contains at least one character. `maxint` being positive infinity and `res` containing `nRow` as a new element are not relevant to the loop execution. `T` remaining greater than 0 and `t` remaining 0 are also not directly related to the loop execution. 
State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
