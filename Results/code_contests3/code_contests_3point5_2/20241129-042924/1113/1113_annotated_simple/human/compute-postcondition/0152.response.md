Example Answer:
`i` is added to `nRow`, and `nRow` initially is an empty string. Since `i` is the first character in `row` and `row` has at least 1 character, `i` is not equal to '9'. Therefore, `i` will be added to `nRow`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index after all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `i` is the first character in `row`, `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated with the value of `i`.**
