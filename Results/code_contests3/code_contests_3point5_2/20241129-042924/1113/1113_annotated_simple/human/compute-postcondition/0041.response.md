Output State: **After appending '1' to `nRow`, if `i` is '9', `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be characters left in `row` to iterate over.**
