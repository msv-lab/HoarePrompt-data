According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row` list and the logic provided in the task description. At the end of the previous iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `row` is not empty. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the next element in `row` is '9', `nRow` should be set to '1'. 
- If the next element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` should be set to '0'. 
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. 
- Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`. 
- If the next element in `row` is '9', `nRow` should be set to '1'. 
- If the next element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` should be set to '0'.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is updated according to the logic provided in the code and description for the next iteration of the loop**.
