Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 1. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains the modified version of the next element in `row` where '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` contains the modified version of the next element in `row` with the updated value.***
