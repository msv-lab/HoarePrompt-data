Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the program state remains as follows: After appending `nRow` to `res`, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If the character at index `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the character at index `i` in `row` is not '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
