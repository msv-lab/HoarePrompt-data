According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `nRow` is an empty string. To execute the loop, `row` needs to have at least one element. 
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string**.
