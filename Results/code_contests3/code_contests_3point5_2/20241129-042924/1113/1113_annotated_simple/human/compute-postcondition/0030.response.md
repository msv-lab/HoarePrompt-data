According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is the input string after stripping and `i` is 9, the loop will execute for each character in the stripped input string. Since `nRow` is initially empty, it needs to be adjusted to hold the modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. Additionally, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `row`. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to represent the index of the character being processed in `row`. 
State: **After appending `nRow` to `res`, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1', `i` is the index of the character being processed in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping, `nRow` is the modified string with '9' replaced with '1'**
