According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character, and `i` is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nRow` must still contain a modified version of `row` with at least one character, and `i` must not be equal to '9'.
State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character, `i` is not equal to '9'**
