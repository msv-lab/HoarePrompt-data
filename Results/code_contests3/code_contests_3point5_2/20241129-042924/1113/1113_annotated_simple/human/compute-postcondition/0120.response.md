Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `nRow` will be modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 1, `nRow` contains the modified version of the next element in `row` with the updated value.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 1, `nRow` contains the modified version of the next element in `row` with the updated value**
