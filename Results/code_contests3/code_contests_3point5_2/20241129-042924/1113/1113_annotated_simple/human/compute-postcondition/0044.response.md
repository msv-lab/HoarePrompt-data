Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `nRow` will contain a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index. All other variables remain unchanged: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged.**
