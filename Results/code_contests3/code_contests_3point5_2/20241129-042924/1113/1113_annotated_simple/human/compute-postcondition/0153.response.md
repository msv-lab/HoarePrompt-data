Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index after all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `i` is the first character in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i`.***
