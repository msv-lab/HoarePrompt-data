According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `row`, and `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character. If `i` is not equal to '9', only '1' is found in the modified version of `row` stored in `nRow`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should not be equal to '9'.
State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and `i` is not equal to '9'**
