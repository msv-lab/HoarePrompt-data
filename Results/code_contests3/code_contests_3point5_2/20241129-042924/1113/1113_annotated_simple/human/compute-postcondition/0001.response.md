Example Answer:
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be executed at exit. The lambda function writes the output stored in `sys.stdout` to the standard output (1). Since the initial state does not have any variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.**
