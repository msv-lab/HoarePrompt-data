Output State: After appending '1' to `nRow`, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index. The rest of the variables remain unchanged: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged.
