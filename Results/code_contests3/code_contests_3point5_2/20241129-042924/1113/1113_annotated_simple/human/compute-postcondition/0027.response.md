According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times based on the range provided. At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `maxint` remains positive infinity
- `res` contains `nRow` as a new element
- `T` remains greater than 0
- `t` remains 0
- `row` remains unchanged
- `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `maxint` remains positive infinity
- `res` contains `nRow` as a new element
- `T` remains greater than 0
- `t` remains 0
- `row` remains unchanged
- `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and all other characters remain unchanged
- The loop variable `i` should be updated to the next value in the range, which is 9

State: **After appending `nRow` to `res`, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1', `i` is 9**
