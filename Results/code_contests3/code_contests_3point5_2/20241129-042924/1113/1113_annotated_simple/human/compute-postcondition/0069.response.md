Example Answer:
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop finishes executing, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string.
