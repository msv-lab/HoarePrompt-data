According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range is not empty, which is the case for range(9). Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
