Postcondition: ***`maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index after all iterations of the loop have finished, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains the concatenated characters of `row`.***
