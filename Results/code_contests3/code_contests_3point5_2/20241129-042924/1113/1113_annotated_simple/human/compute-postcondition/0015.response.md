Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended by the value of `i`, but the initial value of `nRow` is an empty string, and the initial value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the string representation of 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is '0'. `i` is not equal to '9'**
