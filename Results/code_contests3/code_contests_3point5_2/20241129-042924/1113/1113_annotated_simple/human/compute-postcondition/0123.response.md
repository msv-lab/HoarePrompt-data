Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to `res`, where `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string, `i` is the length of `row`, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string, `i` is the length of `row`, `nRow` contains the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed**
