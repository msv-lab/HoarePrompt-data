Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is not empty. If the next element in `row` is '9', `nRow` should be set to '1'. If the next element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` should be set to '0'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i` and if the next element in `row` is '9', `nRow` should be set to '1'. If the next element in `row` is not '9', `nRow` should be set to '0'.***
