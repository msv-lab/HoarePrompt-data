Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is updated according to the logic provided in the code and description for the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is updated according to the logic provided in the code and description for the next iteration of the loop, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
