Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 0, `nRow` contains the modified version of the current element in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow` and `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed. If `i` is not '9', the value of `i` is concatenated with `nRow` and `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed.***
