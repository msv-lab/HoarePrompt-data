According to the code, the loop will always execute since the range is explicitly defined as `range(9)` which will create a sequence from 0 to 8. Therefore, the loop will execute 9 times. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **After the loop finishes executing, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
