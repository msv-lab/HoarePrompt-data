Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string (which is not empty), for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `nRow` contains the string '1' if `i` equals '9', otherwise `nRow` contains consecutive values of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
