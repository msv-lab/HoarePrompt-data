Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the value of `i`. The condition states that `i` is not equal to '9', so `nRow` will be updated with the concatenated value. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and `i` is not equal to '9'**
