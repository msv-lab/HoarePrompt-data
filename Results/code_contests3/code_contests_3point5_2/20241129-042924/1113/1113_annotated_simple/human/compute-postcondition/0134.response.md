Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is a string containing '1' if `i` is equal to '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`, `res` is appended with this final `nRow` for the loop to execute all 9 iterations.***
