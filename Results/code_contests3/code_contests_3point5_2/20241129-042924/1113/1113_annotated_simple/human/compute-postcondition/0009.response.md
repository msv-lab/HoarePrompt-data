Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value**
