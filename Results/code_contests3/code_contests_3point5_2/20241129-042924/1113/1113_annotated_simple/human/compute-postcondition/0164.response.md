According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9, which means `i` should be 10.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's and any other character replaced with its index, `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is the final modified version of `row` after all iterations of the loop have finished**.
