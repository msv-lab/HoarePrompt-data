According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If T is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `t` is now 0. Also, since `res` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution but should be mentioned in the state.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
