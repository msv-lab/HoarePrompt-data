Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` has been updated by adding '1' to its current value for the next iteration of the loop if i is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated according to the logic provided in the code and description for the next iteration of the loop, and `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
