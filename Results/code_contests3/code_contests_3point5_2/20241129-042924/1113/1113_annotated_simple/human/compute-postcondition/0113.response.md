Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row` and the final `nRow`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 0, `nRow` contains the modified version of the current element in `row`, `res` is appended with the final `nRow` after all iterations of the loop have executed, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty. If the current element being iterated over in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the string '1'. If the current element being iterated over in `row` is not '9', `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.***
