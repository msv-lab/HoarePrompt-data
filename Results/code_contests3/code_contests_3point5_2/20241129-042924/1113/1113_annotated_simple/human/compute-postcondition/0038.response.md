Output State: After appending `i` to `nRow`, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `row` remains unchanged, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1'. If the character at index `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the character at index `i` in `row` is not '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be characters left in `row` to iterate over.
