Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Given that `i` is not equal to '9', the resulting value of `nRow` will depend on the specific value of `i`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state will be: `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and the value of `i`.
Output State: **`nRow` contains a modified version of `row` with at least one character and the value of `i`**
