Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `nRow` contains a modified version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1' and any other character is replaced with its index. `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` as a new element, `T` stays greater than 0, `t` remains 0, and `row` remains unchanged. The loop can execute one more time only if there are characters left in `row` to iterate over.***
