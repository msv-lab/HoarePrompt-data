According to the code, the loop executes 9 times as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 8, `nRow` contains modified versions of `row`, and `res` is appended with `nRow`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 9.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains modified versions of `row`, `T` remains greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string, `i` is 9, `nRow` contains modified versions of `row`, and `res` is appended with `nRow`**
