Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the given problem description. The program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' in each row with '1', which is not the correct approach to create an anti-sudoku puzzle. The program does not change at most 9 elements in the grid to make it anti-sudoku as required by the problem description. The program lacks the logic to create an anti-sudoku puzzle by ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
