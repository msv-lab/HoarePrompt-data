Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The given program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to change at most 9 elements in the correct sudoku solution to make it an anti-sudoku. However, the code provided does not perform this logic. Instead, it simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each line of the input sudoku solution without considering the constraints of an anti-sudoku. This means that the output of the program may not always result in an anti-sudoku, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
