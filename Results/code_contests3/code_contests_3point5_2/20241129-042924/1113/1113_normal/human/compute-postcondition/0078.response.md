Example Answer:
The value of `i` is concatenated to `nRow` for each iteration of the loop where `i` takes on the values from 0 to 8 excluding 9. Since the initial value of `nRow` is the concatenated value of `row` and the next value of `i`, the final value of `nRow` will contain all the values of `i` from 0 to 8 concatenated to `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `row` and all the values of `i` from 0 to 8, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `row` and all the values of `i` from 0 to 8, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop**
