Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` will contain the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' along with '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the next value to iterate over, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' along with '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the next value to iterate over, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' along with '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9'**
