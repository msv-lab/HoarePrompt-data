Example Answer: 
The `nRow` string is appended to the `res` list. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` will contain the updated `row` string after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the last element iterated through and its value is not '9'.
