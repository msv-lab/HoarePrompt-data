Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value with more elements, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' if `i` != '9' appended with '1' if `i` == '9' and '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if `i` == '9' after the execution of the if else block.***
