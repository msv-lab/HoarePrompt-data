Example Answer:
The variable `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, which is a function for writing to the standard output. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sys.stdout` is redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object for standard output manipulation, `write` is assigned the `sys.stdout.write` function.
Output State: **`sys.stdout` is redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object for standard output manipulation, `write` is assigned the `sys.stdout.write` function**
