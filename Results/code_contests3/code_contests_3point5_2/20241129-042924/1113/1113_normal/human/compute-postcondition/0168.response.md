Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0. When the if condition (i == '9') is true, i will be equal to the string '9'***
