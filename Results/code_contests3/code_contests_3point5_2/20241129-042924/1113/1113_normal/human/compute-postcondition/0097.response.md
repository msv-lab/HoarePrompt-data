Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` from 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 where `i` is not equal to '9', `i` is 1, `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i`.**
