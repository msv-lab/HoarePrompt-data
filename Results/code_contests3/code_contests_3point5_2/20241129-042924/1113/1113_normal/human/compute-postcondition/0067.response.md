According to the code, the loop will always execute for i in range(9). So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the original `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow`, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8**
