Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', the loop will execute one more time. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated according to the conditions mentioned.
