Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` starts empty and '1' is appended to it, after execution, `nRow` will contain '1'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` iterates through the elements of `row`. When the condition is met, the value of `i` is equal to '9'.
