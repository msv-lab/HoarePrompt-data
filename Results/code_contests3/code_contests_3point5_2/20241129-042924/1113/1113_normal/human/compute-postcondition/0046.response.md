According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than 9.
State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the original `row` with all '9's replaced by '1's, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9**
