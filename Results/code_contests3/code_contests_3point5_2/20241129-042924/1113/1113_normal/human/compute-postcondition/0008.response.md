According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times because the range is specified as 9. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity does not impact the execution of the loop. The loop execution depends on `i` and `T`. Since the loop range is 9, it means `i` will take on values from 0 to 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `T` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
