Example Answer: 
After executing the given code, the variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow`, `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute one more time.
