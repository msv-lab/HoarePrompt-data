Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its existing value. As '1' is being added, the value of `nRow` will have '1' added to the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` has been updated with each iteration by appending the value of `i` and '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the last element iterated through and its value is not '9'.
