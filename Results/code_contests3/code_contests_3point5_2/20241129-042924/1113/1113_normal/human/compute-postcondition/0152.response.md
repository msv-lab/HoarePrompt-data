Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` in each iteration of the loop. The value of `i` is not equal to '9', and the loop continues until that condition is met. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is updated with each iteration by appending the value of `i`, `res` contains the final `nRow`, `i` iterates through the elements of `row`, and the value of `i` is not equal to '9'.
