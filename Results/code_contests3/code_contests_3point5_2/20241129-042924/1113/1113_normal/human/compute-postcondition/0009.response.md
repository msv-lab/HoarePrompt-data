Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value**
