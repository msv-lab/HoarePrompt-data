Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `row` after replacing '9' with '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i`.**
