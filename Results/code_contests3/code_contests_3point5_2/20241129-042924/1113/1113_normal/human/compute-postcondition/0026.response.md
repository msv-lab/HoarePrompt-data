Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the last character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` consists of '1' for each occurrence of '9' in `row` and the original character for any other character in `row` concatenated in order, `res` contains `nRow`.
