Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to `T-1`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the value of `row` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', `res` contains a list of concatenated strings of `nRow` after each iteration of the loop, `i` is the last element in `row` appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i`, and the concatenated strings of `nRow` are printed with newlines separating them.**
