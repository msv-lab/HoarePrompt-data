Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` will be updated with each iteration by appending the value of `i`, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` iterates through the elements of `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', the final state is when `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, the final state is when `i` is not equal to '9'.***
