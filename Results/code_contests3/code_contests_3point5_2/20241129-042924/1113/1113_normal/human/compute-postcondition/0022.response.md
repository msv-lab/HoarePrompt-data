Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9', or it is the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with the current value of `i` and `nRow` is not empty, `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` if `i` is not '9', there are more characters left in `row` to iterate over for the loop to execute one more time**.
