Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. The value of `i` is not specified, so it could be any character other than '9'. Since `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` with '1' appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value**
