Postcondition: ***`maxint` is still the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is still greater than 0, `t` is still 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to it if `i` is equal to '9' or by adding the next element `i` to it if `i` is not equal to '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the next element in `row`***
