According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the conditions related to `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are present:
* `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity
* `T` is greater than 0
* `t` is 1
* `row` contains the stripped input value and is not an empty string
* `nRow` contains '11' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` from 0 to 8 excluding '9'
* `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop
* For the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 where `i` is not equal to '9'
* `i` is 1
* `i` is not equal to '9'

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
* If `i` is not '9', `nRow` should be updated by concatenating the value of `i` for the next iteration.
* `i` should be updated to the next value in the range of 0 to 8 that is not equal to '9'.

State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` from 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 where `i` is not equal to '9', `i` is the next value in the range of 0 to 8 that is not equal to '9'.**
