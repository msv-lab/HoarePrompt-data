Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is assigned the value of `i` concatenated with its previous value and `nRow` is not empty.***
