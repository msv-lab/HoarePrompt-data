Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The value of `nRow` changes with each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one more element to iterate through, `nRow` has been updated with each iteration by appending the value of `i` and possibly '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the last element iterated through and its value is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value with at least one more element to iterate through, `nRow` has been updated with each iteration by appending the value of `i` and possibly '1', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the last element iterated through and its value is not '9'**
