According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the loop, `nRow` will contain the final result. So for the loop to execute successfully, `row` must have at least 1 element, `nRow` will be updated with each iteration, and `i` will iterate through the elements of `row`. 
State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` will be updated with each iteration, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` iterates through the elements of `row`.**
