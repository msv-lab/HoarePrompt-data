Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have an additional '1' at the end. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` has '1' appended to it.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` has '1' appended to it**
