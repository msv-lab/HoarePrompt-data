According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row` and the characters in it. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time: 
- `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`.
- If the current character `i` is '9', `nRow` should have '1' appended to it. 
- If the current character `i` is not '9', `nRow` should be updated by adding `i`.

State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i` for the loop to execute one more time**
