Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is an input integer.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is an input integer**
