According to the code, the loop can execute for a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity
- `T` is greater than 0
- `t` is 0
- `i` is the last character in `row`
- `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string
- `nRow` consists of '1' for each occurrence of '9' in `row` and the original character for any other character in `row` concatenated in order
- `res` contains `nRow`

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`
- `nRow` needs to be updated based on the next character in `row`
  
State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated based on the next character in `row`, `res` contains `nRow`**
