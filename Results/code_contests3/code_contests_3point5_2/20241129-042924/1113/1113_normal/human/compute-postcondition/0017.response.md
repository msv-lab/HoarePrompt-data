According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` which is a string. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the last character in the `row`, and `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9', or it is the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with the current value of `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `maxint` remains the float representation of positive infinity.
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `t` remains 0.
- `i` will be the next character in the `row` string.
- `row` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- If the next character `i` is '9', then `nRow` should be '1'.
- If the next character `i` is not '9', then `nRow` should be the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with the current value of `i`, and `nRow` should not be empty.

State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9', or it is the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with the current value of `i` and `nRow` is not empty**.
