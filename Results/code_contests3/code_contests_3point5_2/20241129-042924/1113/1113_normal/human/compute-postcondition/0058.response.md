Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is '1' if `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the value of `i` concatenated with '1' if the condition is true. If the condition is false, `nRow` is assigned the value of `i` + `i`, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow`, `i` is the length of `row`***
