According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` should be less than the length of `row`. Additionally, `nRow` is an empty string that will be modified during the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow`, `i` is less than the length of `row`**
