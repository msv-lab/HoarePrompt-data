Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1' and `res` contains `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` contains the first character in `row` and `res` contains `nRow`.***
