Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains either '1' or the value of `i` after each loop iteration, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is 0. If the condition (i == '9') is true, `i` becomes '9'. If the condition is false, `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` for each iteration of the loop.***
