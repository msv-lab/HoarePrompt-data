Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but based on the given conditions, `nRow` is not empty. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will have the value of the previous `nRow` concatenated with '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` has the updated value based on the conditions mentioned.**
