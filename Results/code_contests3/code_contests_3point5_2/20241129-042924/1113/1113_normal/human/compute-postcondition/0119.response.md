Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is a concatenated string of values in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9'. After appending '1', the new value of `nRow` will include '1' at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the next value to iterate over with more values, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the next value to iterate over with more values, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i1'**
