Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the next element `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is still the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is still greater than 0, `t` is still 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is updated by adding the next element `i` to it, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the next element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is still the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is still greater than 0, `t` is still 2, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is updated by adding the next element `i` to it, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is the next element in `row`**
