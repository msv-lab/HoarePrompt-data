Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `row` and the next value of `i`, `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute the next value of `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 where the next value of `i` is not equal to '9'. In both cases, `nRow` is appended with '1'.***
