Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `nRow`. The value of `nRow` is the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9', so the new value of `res` will contain the previous values of `res` along with the appended `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9', `res` contains the final `nRow` after appending `nRow` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9', otherwise appended with the values of `i`**
