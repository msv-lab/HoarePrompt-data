Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is either '1' or contains concatenated values of `i` in the range of 0 to 8 excluding '9' appended with '1' if i == '9'. After execution, `nRow` will have '1' appended. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value with more elements, `nRow` contains '1' if i == '9' appended with '1' and '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the stripped input value with more elements, `nRow` contains '1' if i == '9' appended with '1' and '1'**
