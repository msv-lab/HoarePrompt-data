Postcondition: ***`maxint` is the float representation of positive infinity, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not an empty string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by adding `i` for the loop to execute one more time.***
