You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a correct solution of the sudoku puzzle. If you don't know what is the sudoku, you can read about it [here](http://tiny.cc/636xmz).

The picture showing the correct sudoku solution:

<image>

Blocks are bordered with bold black color.

Your task is to change at most 9 elements of this field (i.e. choose some 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 9 and change the number at the position (i, j) to any other number in range [1; 9]) to make it anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku is the 9 × 9 field, in which:

  * Any number in this field is in range [1; 9]; 
  * each row contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each column contains at least two equal elements; 
  * each 3 × 3 block (you can read what is the block in the link above) contains at least two equal elements. 



It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 9 lines, each line consists of 9 characters from 1 to 9 without any whitespaces — the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.

Output

For each test case, print the answer — the initial field with at most 9 changed elements so that the obtained field is anti-sudoku. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Program:
```
sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
write = sys.stdout.write
maxint = float('inf')
res = []
T = int(input())
for t in range(T):
    for i in range(9):
        row = input().strip()
        nRow = ''
        for i in row:
            if i == '9':
                nRow += '1'
            else:
                nRow += i
        res.append(nRow)
write('\n'.join(res))
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
