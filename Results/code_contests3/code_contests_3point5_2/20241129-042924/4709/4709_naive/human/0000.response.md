Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program takes input of a 3x3 square grid and prints the string of length 3 by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid. The program correctly splits the input into rows, takes the diagonal elements, and prints the concatenated string correctly. 
For all possible inputs of a 3x3 grid, the program will correctly output the string obtained by concatenating the diagonal elements. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
