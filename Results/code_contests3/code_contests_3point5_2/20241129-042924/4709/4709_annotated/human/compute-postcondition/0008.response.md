According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of A and B after converting them to integers. If the integer value of A is less than the integer value of B, the loop will execute. 
Before the loop starts, A is assigned the value of the first string in list l and B is assigned the value of the second string in list l. 
So, for the loop to execute, A should be assigned the first string in list l, B should be assigned the second string in list l, and the integer value of A should be less than the integer value of B.
State: **a is assigned the value of the raw input, l is a list of 3 strings, each containing 3 letters, A is assigned the value of the first string in list l, B is assigned the value of the second string in list l, ans is 1 if the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, for the loop to execute the first time the integer value of A is less than the integer value of B**
