Functionality: **The function `func` reads a user input consisting of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. It then extracts two strings A and B from the input. If the integer values of A and B are equal, it sets `ans` to 1. Next, it iterates over a range of integers between the values of A and B, converting each integer to a list of digits. If the first and fifth digits as well as the second and fourth digits are equal in any number within the range, it increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
