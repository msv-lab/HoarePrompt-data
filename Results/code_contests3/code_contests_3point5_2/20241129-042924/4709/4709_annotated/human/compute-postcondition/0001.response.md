Example Answer:
The string `a` is split into a list of strings based on whitespace and assigned to `l`. Since the input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` will be a list of 3 strings, each containing 3 letters. 
Output State: **Input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as c_{ij} where i and j are integers ranging from 1 to 3; a is assigned the value of the raw input; l is a list of 3 strings, each containing 3 letters**
