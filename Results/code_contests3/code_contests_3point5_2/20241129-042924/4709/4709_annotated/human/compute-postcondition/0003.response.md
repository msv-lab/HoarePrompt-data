Example Answer:
B is assigned the value of the second string in list l. As A was assigned the value of the first string in list l, the value of B depends on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: Input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as c_{ij} where i and j are integers ranging from 1 to 3; a is assigned the value of the raw input; l is a list of 3 strings, each containing 3 letters; A is assigned the value of the first string in list l; B is assigned the value of the second string in list l.
