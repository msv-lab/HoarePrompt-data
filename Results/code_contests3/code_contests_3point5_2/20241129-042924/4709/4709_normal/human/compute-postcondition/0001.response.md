Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of splitting the input string `a` into a list based on whitespace. Since the input consists of lowercase English letters, the 3x3 grid is split into a list of 3 elements, each element containing 3 letters. 
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element consisting of 3 lowercase English letters**
