Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element consisting of 3 lowercase English letters; `A` is a list containing 3 lowercase English letters; `B` is a list containing 3 lowercase English letters; `ans` is 3, `i` is equal to the integer value of `A`, for the loop to execute the second time the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of the next element in `B`; `C` is a list containing the string representation of `i` with conditions maintained. If the first and fifth elements of `C` are equal and the second and fourth elements of `C` are equal, then the program executes the if block.***
