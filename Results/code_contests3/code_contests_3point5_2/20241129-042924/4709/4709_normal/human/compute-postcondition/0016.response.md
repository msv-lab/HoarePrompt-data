Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element consisting of 3 lowercase English letters; `A` is a list containing 3 lowercase English letters; `B` is a list containing 3 lowercase English letters; `ans` is 2, `i` is equal to the integer value of `A`, for the loop to execute the second time the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of the next element in `B`; `C` is a list containing the string representation of `i` with conditions maintained. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then the program retains the initial state.***
