Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program is trying to compare integer values and perform operations on them, which is not what the problem description asks for. The program should be concatenating the lowercase English letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, but it is not doing so. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
