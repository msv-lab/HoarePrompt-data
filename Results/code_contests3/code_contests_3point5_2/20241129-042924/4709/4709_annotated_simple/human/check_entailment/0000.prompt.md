You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a 3Ã—3 square grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letters. The letter in the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is c_{ij}.

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Constraints

* Input consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}


Output

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Examples

Input

ant
obe
rec


Output

abc


Input

edu
cat
ion


Output

ean
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input grid consists of lowercase English letters in a 3x3 square grid.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *The input grid consists of lowercase English letters in a 3x3 square grid. `l` is a list containing the rows of the grid after splitting the input, `A` is assigned the value of the first row of the grid, `B` is assigned the value of the second row of the grid, `ans` is 1. If the integer value of row A is equal to the integer value of row B, `ans` is updated to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a list containing the rows of the grid after splitting the input, `A` is assigned the value of the first row of the grid, `B` is assigned the value of the second row of the grid, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions in the loop.
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
