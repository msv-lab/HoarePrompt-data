According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. If the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is already 1. So for the loop to execute the first time, the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B` and `i` is equal to the integer value of `A`.
State: **`l` is a list containing the rows of the grid after splitting the input, `A` is assigned the value of the first row of the grid, `B` is assigned the value of the second row of the grid, `ans` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`, `i` is equal to the integer value of `A`**
