Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the rows of the grid after splitting the input, `A` is assigned the value of the first row of the grid, `B` is assigned the value of the second row of the grid, `ans` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `i` is equal to the integer value of `A` + 1, `C` is a list containing the characters of the integer value of `A` converted to strings. If the characters at index 0 and index 4 of list `C` are equal and the characters at index 1 and index 3 of list `C` are equal, then the program executes the if part.***
