Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input consisting of two rows from a 3x3 square grid of lowercase English letters. It compares the integer values of the rows, updates a count variable `ans` based on certain conditions, and prints the final count value. If the integer values of the rows are equal, `ans` is set to 1. Then, it checks the digits in the range of the two row values and increments `ans` based on specific digit conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
