Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing the rows of the grid after splitting the input, `A` is assigned the value of the first row of the grid, `B` is assigned the value of the second row of the grid, `ans` is either 1 or 2, depending on the condition. `i` is equal to the integer value of `A`, `C` is a list containing the characters of the integer value of `A` converted to strings. If the first and fifth characters of `A` are equal, and the second and fourth characters of `A` are equal, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
