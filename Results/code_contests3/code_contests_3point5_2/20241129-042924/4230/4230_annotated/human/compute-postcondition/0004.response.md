According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2` (second last integer element of the door sequence list) and the loop is iterating in reverse order.
State: **`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2` and the loop is iterating in reverse order**
