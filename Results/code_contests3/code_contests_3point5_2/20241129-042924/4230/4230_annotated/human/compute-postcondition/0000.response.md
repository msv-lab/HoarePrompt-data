Example Answer:
The code `n = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input in the form of a sequence of integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black. The input is split based on spaces, converted to integers, and stored in variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer, the new state after execution will have `n` as a list of integers representing the door sequence.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers representing the door sequence**
