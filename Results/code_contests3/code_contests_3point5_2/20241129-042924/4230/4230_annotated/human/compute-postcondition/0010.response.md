The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is `(n - 2) - 1`. Since `i` is `(n - 2) - 1`, then `i` is equal to `n - 3`. Therefore, `ans` is `(n - 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is `n - 2`, the loop is iterating in reverse order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `c` is a list.**
