Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is `(n - 2)`, the loop is iterating in reverse order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `(n - 3)`, `c` is a list. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
