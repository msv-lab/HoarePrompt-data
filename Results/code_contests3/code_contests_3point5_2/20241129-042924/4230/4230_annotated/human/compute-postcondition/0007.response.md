Output State: **`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is `n - 1`, the loop is iterating in reverse order, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `c` is a list, the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
