Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input list obtained by splitting the raw input. Since the initial state is `n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list**
