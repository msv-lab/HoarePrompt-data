The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a sequence of n integers representing the doors opened by Mr. Black. The sequence consists of 0s and 1s, where 0 indicates a door in the left exit and 1 indicates a door in the right exit. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it likely performs some operations or calculations based on the sequence of doors opened by Mr. Black.
