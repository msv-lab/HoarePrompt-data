Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. The value of `n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, but the specific value of `n` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer element of the door sequence list, `ans` is 0**
