Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input sequence of doors opened by Mr. Black and iterates through the sequence to find the index of the last element where the door changes from left to right exit or vice versa. This index represents the point at which Mr. Black can exit the house. The program then prints this index, which is the correct output according to the problem description. The program handles all cases where Mr. Black opens the doors in a way that ensures he can exit the house as described in the problem.
