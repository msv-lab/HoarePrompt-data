Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the smallest index `k` such that after Mr. Black opens the first `k` doors, he is able to exit the house. It iterates through the sequence of doors opened by Mr. Black in reverse order, checking if the current door is in a different exit than the next door. Once it finds such a door, it sets `ans` to be the index of that door plus 1, which is the smallest index `k` where Mr. Black can exit the house.

The program follows the problem description and correctly determines the index `k` where Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors.
