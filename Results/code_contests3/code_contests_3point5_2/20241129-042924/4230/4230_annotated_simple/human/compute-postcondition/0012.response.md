Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, the program remains unchanged and breaks out of the loop or if statement it is directly inside.***
