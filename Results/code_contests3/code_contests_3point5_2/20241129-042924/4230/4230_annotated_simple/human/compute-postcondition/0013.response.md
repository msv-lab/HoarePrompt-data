According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the contents of the map object `c`. If `i` becomes equal to `n - 3` and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object, and `ans` is the value of `i + 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be equal to n - 3 and `c[i]` should be equal to `c[i + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3 and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]**.
