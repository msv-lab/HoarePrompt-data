Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is n - 3, so after execution, `ans` becomes n - 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object, `ans` is equal to n - 2, and for the loop to execute the next time `i` should be equal to n - 3 and `c[i]` should be equal to `c[i + 1]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object, `ans` is equal to n - 2, for the loop to execute the next time `i` should be equal to n - 3 and `c[i]` should be equal to `c[i + 1]**.
