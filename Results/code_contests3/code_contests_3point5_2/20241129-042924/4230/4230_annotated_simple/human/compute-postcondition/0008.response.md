Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to n - 2. If the element at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
