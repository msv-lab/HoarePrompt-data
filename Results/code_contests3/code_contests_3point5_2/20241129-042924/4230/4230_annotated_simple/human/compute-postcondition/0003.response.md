Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, and it represents the first element of the sequence of integers opened by Mr. Black. `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them. `ans` is 0.
