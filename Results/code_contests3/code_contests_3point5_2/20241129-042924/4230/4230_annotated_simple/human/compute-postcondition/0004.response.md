According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 3, since `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to start. Additionally, the loop will iterate from `n - 2` to 0 in reverse order. Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to n - 2**
