Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3. The code does not change any variable values but breaks out of the loop or if statement it is directly inside.**
