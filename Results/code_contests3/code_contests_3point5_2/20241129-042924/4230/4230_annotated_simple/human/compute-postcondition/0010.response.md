Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and it is mentioned that for the loop to execute the next time, `i` should be equal to `n - 3`. This means that `ans` is the value that `i` will have during the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3**
