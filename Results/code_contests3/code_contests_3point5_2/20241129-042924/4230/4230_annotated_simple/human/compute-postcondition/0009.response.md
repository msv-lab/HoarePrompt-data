According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `c`, `i`, and the condition mentioned regarding the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `c`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to n - 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `n` remains the same as it does not change during the loop iterations.
- `c` remains the same as it is not mentioned to change during the loop iterations.
- `ans` will be updated to reflect the new value of `i` for the next iteration. Since `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, for the next iteration, `ans` will be `i + 1 + 1` which simplifies to `i + 2`.
- `i` will be updated to reflect the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `n - 2` to -1, for the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.
- Additionally, the condition mentioned regarding the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` in `c` should be checked to determine if the loop should break.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, `c` is a map object created by converting the input integers to integers and splitting them, `ans` is the value of `i + 2`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is equal to n - 3.**
