Functionality: **The function `func` reads input representing the number of doors `n` and a sequence of door states. It iterates through the sequence to find the index where the door state changes and prints that index as output. The function does not return a specific value, and the output depends on the provided sequence of integers. The code might not handle cases where the door state sequence has certain patterns or edge cases, as it only focuses on finding the index of the first change in the sequence.**
