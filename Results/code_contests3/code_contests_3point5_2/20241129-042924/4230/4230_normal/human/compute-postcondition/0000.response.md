Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by space to integers. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, the `map` function will convert the input to a list of integers. The sequence of opened doors is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
