Example Answer:
The code maps the input values to integers and splits them. However, raw_input() is not a valid function in Python 3, so this code will result in an error. Since the code cannot be executed successfully, the output state will remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
