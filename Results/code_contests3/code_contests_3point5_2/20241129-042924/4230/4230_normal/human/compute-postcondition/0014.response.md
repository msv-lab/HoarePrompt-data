Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is `n - 4`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 4`, and `ans` was initially `n - 3`, after execution `ans` will be `n - 3 + 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `ans` is `n - 2`, and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` is satisfied.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `ans` is `n - 2`, and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` is satisfied**
