Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `n`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be either 0 or 1. The state of the list `n` is not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1, the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
