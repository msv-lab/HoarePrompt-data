The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the global variables `n` and the sequence of opened doors, which is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the opened doors based on a specific logic defined within the function.

Functionality: **The function operates on a global variable `n` and a list of n integers representing the sequence of opened doors. It modifies the state of the doors according to a specific logic defined within the function.**
