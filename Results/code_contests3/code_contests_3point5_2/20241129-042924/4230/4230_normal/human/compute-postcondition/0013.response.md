According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the condition `c[i] != c[i + 1]`. If the condition is satisfied, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n - 2`, and `c[i] != c[i + 1]` is satisfied. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` should remain greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` needs to be updated to `i - 1`.
- `ans` should be updated to `ans - 1`.
- The condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` should be satisfied to break out of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `ans` is `n - 3`, and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` is satisfied** for the loop to execute one more time.
