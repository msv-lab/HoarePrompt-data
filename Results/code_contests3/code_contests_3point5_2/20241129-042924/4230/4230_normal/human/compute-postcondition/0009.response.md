According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, `ans`, and the values of `c` at index `i` and `i+1`. If the values of `c` at index `i` and `i+1` are equal, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i - 1`, and `ans` needs to be adjusted to `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n`**
