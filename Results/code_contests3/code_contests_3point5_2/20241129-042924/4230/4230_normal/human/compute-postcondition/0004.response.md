According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Additionally, since the loop starts at `n - 2`, the initial value of `i` should be `n - 2` for the loop to execute the first time. Also, since `ans` starts at 0 and is not modified within the loop, it remains 0 throughout. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 0 for the loop to execute**
