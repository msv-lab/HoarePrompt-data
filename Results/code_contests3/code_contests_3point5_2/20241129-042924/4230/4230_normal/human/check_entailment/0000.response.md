Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code is supposed to find the smallest index `k` such that after Mr. Black opened the first `k` doors, he was able to exit the house. However, the code implementation does not correctly identify this smallest index `k`. 

For example, in the input:
```
5
0 0 1 0 0
```
The correct output should be `3`, as after opening the first three doors, Mr. Black can exit the house. However, the code will output `2` in this case, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
