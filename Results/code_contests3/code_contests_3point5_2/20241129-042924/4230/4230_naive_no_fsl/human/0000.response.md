Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the smallest integer k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. The program iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and checks if the current door is in a different exit than the next door. If it finds such a door, it updates the answer and breaks out of the loop. This approach follows the problem description and correctly determines the smallest index k for Mr. Black to exit the house.
