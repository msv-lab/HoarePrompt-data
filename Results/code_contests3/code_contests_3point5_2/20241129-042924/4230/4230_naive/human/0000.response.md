Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly reads the input, iterates through the sequence of opened doors, and determines the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The program checks if the doors from the left and right exits are open in the sequence provided, and updates the answer accordingly. The logic seems to be correct and handles the problem description as expected. The program iterates through the sequence in reverse order to find the smallest index k where Mr. Black can exit the house. Overall, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description.
