Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
