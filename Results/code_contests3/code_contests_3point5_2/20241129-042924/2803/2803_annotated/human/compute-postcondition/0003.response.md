Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if `k - 1` is non-zero, it computes `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not explicitly return any value. The function operates under the constraint that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
