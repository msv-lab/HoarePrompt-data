Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program does not take into account the xor-sum requirement specified in the problem description. Instead, it calculates and prints a value based on the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` and the value of `k`.

The program does not consider the relationship between the tastiness of candies and their xor-sum. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct solution for the given problem.
