Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of n (excluding the '0b' prefix) minus 1 if k - 1 is true, otherwise it returns n. Since k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, if k - 1 is false, the code snippet returns n. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
