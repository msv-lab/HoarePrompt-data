Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
