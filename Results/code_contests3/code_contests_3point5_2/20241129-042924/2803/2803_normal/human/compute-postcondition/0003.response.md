Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integer inputs n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then calculates the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items and prints the result. **

Note: The annotations mention that the function does not accept any parameters, but the code actually reads input n and k from the user. Additionally, the calculation performed in the code is related to finding the number of ways to choose k items from n items using a specific formula, which may not be immediately clear from the annotations.
