The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. The parameters n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the number of combinations of choosing k items from a set of n items.
