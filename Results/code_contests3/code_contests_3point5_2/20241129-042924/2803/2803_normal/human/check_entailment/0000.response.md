Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- It then calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items and prints the result.
- The solution provided is based on the fact that the xor-sum of numbers from 1 to n is periodic with a period of 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^x.
- Therefore, the code calculates the maximum xor-sum possible by considering the binary representation of `n` and using the formula 2^m - 1, where m is the number of bits needed to represent `n`.
- If k = 1, then the maximum xor-sum is `n` itself since Grisha can take only one candy.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
