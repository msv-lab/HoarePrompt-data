Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum according to the problem description. It calculates the largest xor-sum by using the formula (2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1) if k is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns n. This logic aligns with the problem statement and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
