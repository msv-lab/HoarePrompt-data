Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain within the constraints of taking no more than k candies from the bag. The program uses bitwise XOR operations to calculate the xor-sum and determines the largest possible value by considering the binary representation of n and k. It covers all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
