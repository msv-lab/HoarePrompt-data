Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which is then split and converted to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `k` can range from 1 to 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18**
