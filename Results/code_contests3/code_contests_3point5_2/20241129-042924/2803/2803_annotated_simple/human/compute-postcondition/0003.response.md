Functionality: **The function reads two integers n and k from the user input, where n and k are integers satisfying 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18. It then calculates and prints a value based on the condition: if k is not 1, it computes 2 raised to the length of the binary representation of n minus 1; otherwise, it prints n.**
