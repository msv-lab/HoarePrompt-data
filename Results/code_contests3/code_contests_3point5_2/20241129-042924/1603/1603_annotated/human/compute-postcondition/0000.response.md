Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
