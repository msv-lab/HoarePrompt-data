Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate the output in a way that maximizes the sum of beauties of all segments as described in the problem description. The program simply prints a string of '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is odd. This does not take into account the visitors' preferences and the goal of maximizing the total beauty of all segments. The program does not address the actual problem described in the problem statement.
