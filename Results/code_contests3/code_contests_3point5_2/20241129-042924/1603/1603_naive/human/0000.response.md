Correctness: **False**

The given program only considers the case where the number of flowers is even. It generates the output by placing roses and lilies alternatively. However, the problem description requires Sonya to maximize the sum of beauties of all segments visited by visitors.

To illustrate the issue with the provided program, consider the following case:
Input
```
5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5
```
Expected Output
```
01100
```
For the above input, the expected output is "01100" which maximizes the total beauty to 8. However, the program will output "10101" which does not yield the maximum total beauty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
