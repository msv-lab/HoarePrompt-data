Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book on the same day as she starts reading. In this case, the current implementation will output the next day as the minimum day she finishes reading. 

For example, for the input:
2 1
0 0

The correct output should be 1, but the program will output 2. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
