The function `func` reads inputs n and t, and a list of n non-negative integers. It then iterates over the elements of the list subtracting each element from 86400 until t becomes non-positive. The function prints the total number of iterations performed during the loop. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the predefined variables n, t, and the list a.
