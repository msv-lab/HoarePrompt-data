The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function works with predefined variables n, t, and a list ai. The constraints state that n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, and the list ai contains n non-negative integers where each element ai is between 0 and 86400. The function operates using these predefined variables and does not require any input parameters. The function likely performs some operations on the list ai based on the values of n and t, but the specific details of these operations are not provided in the description. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to work with predefined variables n, t, and a list ai, performing operations on ai based on the constraints provided.
