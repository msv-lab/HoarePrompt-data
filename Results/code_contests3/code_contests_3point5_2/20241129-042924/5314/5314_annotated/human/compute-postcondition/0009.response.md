According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^6. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be adjusted by decreasing it by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1]). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the second time then t is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1])**
