Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the list obtained by mapping integers from the raw input. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6**
