According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input split values, and `i` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then t is greater than 0**
