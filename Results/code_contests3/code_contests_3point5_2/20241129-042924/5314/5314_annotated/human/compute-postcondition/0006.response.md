According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1]). To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `t` should be greater than the result of 86400 - int(a[i]).
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time then t is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1])**
