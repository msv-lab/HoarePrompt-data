Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i]) where `i` is 2. The previous values of `t` and `a` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time then t is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1]).
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time then t is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1])**
