Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by the result of 86400 - int(a[i-1]), where `i` is 3. The value of `a[i]` is unknown, but `i` is 3, so `a[i-1]` is the value at index 2 of the list `a`. Therefore, `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[2]). Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input split values, `i` is 3, `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[2])**
