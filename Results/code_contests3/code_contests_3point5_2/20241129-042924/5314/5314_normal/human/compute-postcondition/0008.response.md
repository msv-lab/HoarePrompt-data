Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]) for the loop to execute again**
