Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]). The value of `t` and `i` are known, but the value of `a[i]` is uninitialized. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]) for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]) for the loop to execute again**
