Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are: `n`, `t`, `ai` remain unchanged, and `i` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]).
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i])**
