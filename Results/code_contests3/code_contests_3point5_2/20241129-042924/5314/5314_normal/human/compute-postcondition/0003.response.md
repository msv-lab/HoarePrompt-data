According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, and `i` is 0. Since `t` is the only condition for the loop, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
