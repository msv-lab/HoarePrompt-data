Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string and converting them to integers. The input contains two integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `t` are within the specified ranges. The initial state does not mention the list `ai`, so it remains uninitialized.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, list `ai` remains uninitialized**
