Example Answer:
The variable `i` is initialized to 0. Since `ai` remains uninitialized and there are no other affected variables, the output state is: `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 0**
