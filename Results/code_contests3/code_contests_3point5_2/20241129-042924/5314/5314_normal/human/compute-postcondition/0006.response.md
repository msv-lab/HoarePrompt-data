According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, `ai` remains uninitialized, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` is greater than 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]) from its current value.
