Example Answer:
The input is split into a list and assigned to variable `a`. The values of `n` and `t` are correct, but `ai` remains uninitialized. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned correctly, list `ai` remains uninitialized.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned correctly, list `ai` remains uninitialized**
