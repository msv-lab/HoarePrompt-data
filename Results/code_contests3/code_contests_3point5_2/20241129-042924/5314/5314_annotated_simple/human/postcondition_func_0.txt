The function reads input consisting of two integers n and t, where n represents the number of days and t is the total time available. It then reads n integers representing the time Luba has to spend on work each day. The function iterates through the days, subtracting the time Luba has to spend each day from the total time available. It prints the number of days Luba can work based on the given constraints.
