Example Answer:
The variable `i` is initialized with the value 0. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned the values of the first two integers entered, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values of the first two integers entered, `i` is 0**
