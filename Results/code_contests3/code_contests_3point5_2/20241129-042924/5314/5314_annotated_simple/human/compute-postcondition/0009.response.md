According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` have been updated based on the calculation, and `i` has been further incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` have been updated, `i` has been further incremented, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
