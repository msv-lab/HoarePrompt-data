Example Answer:
The `raw_input().split()` function reads a line from input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to variable `a`. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are assigned the values of the first two integers entered.
Output State: **n and t are assigned the values of the first two integers entered**
