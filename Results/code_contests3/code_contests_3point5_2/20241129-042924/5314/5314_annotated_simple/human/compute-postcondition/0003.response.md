According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are assigned the values of the first two integers entered, and `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are assigned the values of the first two integers entered, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
