Example Answer:
The `print(i)` statement will output the current value of variable `i`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `i` are not affecting this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` has been updated based on the calculations, `t` is 0 or negative, `i` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop, and the current value of `i` is printed.
Output State: **`n` has been updated based on the calculations, `t` is 0 or negative, `i` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop, the current value of `i` is printed**
