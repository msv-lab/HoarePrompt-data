Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of days Luba can finish reading the book. The current implementation simply subtracts the time spent working on each day from the total time required to read the book, without taking into consideration the fact that Luba can use remaining free time on reading.

To correct the program, we need to consider the possibility of using any remaining time after work on reading. This can be achieved by checking if the remaining time after subtracting the work time on a particular day is greater than zero, and if so, increment the day count. This way, Luba will be able to finish reading the book in the minimum number of days as required by the problem description.
