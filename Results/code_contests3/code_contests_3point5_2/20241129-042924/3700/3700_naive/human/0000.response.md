Correctness: **False**

For the given program, there are several issues:
1. The function `func_1` is not related to the problem description and is not used anywhere in the program.
2. The function `func_2` is reading input from `raw_input()` which is not a valid Python function. The correct function to use is `input()`.
3. The logic in the `func_2` function is not related to the problem description. It is checking if the sum of all health values is greater than or equal to `H`, and printing 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. This is not the required functionality as per the problem description.

Therefore, based on the deviations from the problem description and the incorrect implementation, the correctness of the program is **False**.
