Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided includes two functions, func_1 and func_2, which are not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description and the examples given, the code seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. The code reads the input values, calculates the sum of monster healths, and compares it with the maximum health value. The logic seems to align with the problem requirements, and the examples provided in the problem description give the expected outputs. Therefore, the code is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
