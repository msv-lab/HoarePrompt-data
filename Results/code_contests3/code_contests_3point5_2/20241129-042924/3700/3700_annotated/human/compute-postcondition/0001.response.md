Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of integers entered as input. The sum is stored in variable `s`. The previous values of variables N and K are unknown, as they are assigned values based on the input split. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5; H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9; H, N are assigned values based on the input split; s is the sum of integers entered.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5; H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9; H, N are assigned values based on the input split; s is the sum of integers entered.**
