Postcondition: ***N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5; H_i are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9; H, N are assigned values based on the input split; s is the sum of integers entered. If the sum of integers entered is greater than or equal to H, the program prints 'Yes'. If the sum of integers entered is less than H, the program prints 'No'.***
