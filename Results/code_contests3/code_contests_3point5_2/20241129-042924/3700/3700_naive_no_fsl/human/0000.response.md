Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the described problem. It is defining two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not implement the logic to find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. The functions defined in the program are unrelated to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the required functionality to solve the given problem.
