Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the sum of two integers `a` and `b`. If the sum `c` is greater than or equal to a predefined value `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. This function is not directly related to the problem description but seems to be a generic utility function.

Function 2 (`func_2`) reads input values for `N` and `K`, and then reads a list of `N` integers representing the health of each monster. It calculates the total health of all monsters and checks if it is greater than or equal to `H`. If it is, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'.

While the program does not directly calculate the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack before winning, it does not claim to do so. Instead, it seems to be checking if the total health of monsters is greater than a given value `H`. 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem description, but it does not claim to solve the specific problem mentioned.
