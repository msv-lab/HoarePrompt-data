The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from user input, calculates the sum `s` of integers obtained from another user input, and then prints 'Yes' if `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value specified. The function operates based on the input values without any validation or error handling.
