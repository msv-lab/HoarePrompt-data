Example Answer:
The code snippet simply prints 'Yes' and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. H_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i; s is the sum of the integers obtained from the input split operation. The sum s is greater than or equal to H.**
