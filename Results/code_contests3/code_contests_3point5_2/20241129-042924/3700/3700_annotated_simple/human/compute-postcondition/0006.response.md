Postcondition: ***N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. H_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i; s is the sum of the integers obtained from the input split operation. If the sum s is greater than or equal to H, the program executes normally. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.***
