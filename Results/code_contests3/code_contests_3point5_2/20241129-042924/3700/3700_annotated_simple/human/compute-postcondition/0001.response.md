Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of the integers obtained from splitting the input by whitespace. The sum is assigned to variable `s`. Since the input is split and converted to integers, the values of N and K do not change. The range of N and K is not violated. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. H_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i; s is the sum of the integers obtained from the input split operation.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. H_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i; s is the sum of the integers obtained from the input split operation**
