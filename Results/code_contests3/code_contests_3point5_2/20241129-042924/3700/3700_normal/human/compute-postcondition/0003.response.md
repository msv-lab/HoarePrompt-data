Example Answer: 
The code snippet simply prints 'Yes' to the console. It does not affect the initial state variables N, K, H, or s. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers, 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i, H and N are assigned values based on the input split operation, s contains the sum of the input integers. The sum of the input integers is greater than or equal to H**
