Postcondition: ***N and K are non-negative integers, 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for all i, H and N are assigned values based on the input split operation, s contains the sum of the input integers. If the sum of the input integers is greater than or equal to H, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program executes the else part and prints 'No'.***
