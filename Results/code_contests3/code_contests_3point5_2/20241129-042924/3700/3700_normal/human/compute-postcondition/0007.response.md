The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the first N terms of a sequence, where each term is generated by multiplying the index of the term by K and adding the value of the previous term. The function returns the sum of the first N terms of the sequence. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to calculate the sum of the first N terms of a sequence generated based on the given parameters N and K.
