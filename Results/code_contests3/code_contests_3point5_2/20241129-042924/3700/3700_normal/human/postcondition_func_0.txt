The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and assigns it to variable `c`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to the value of `mod`, `c` is adjusted to be less than `mod`. The function then returns the final value of `c`. The functionality of the function is to ensure that the returned value `c` is always less than `mod` if it was originally greater than or equal to `mod`.
