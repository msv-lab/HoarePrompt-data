Function number 1 seems to be unrelated to the given problem description, so we will focus on function number 2.

Initial assessment:
The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from the input, calculates the sum of `N` integers also from the input, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise it prints 'No'. This function does not seem to be related to the problem description of Fennec fighting monsters, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_2` has no logic related to the problem description of Fennec fighting monsters. It simply reads two integers, compares them, and outputs 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison. Since the function does not address the problem described, it is incorrect.
