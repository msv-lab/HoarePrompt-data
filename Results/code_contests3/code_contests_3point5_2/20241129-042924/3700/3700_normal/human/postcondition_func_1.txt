The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers H and N from the input, calculates the sum of N integers also from the input, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compare the sum of N integers with a given value H and output 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.
