The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the remainder of dividing n by a and m by b. If both remainders are 0, the function returns "Both divisible". If only n/a has a remainder of 0, the function returns "Only n divisible". If only m/b has a remainder of 0, the function returns "Only m divisible". If neither n/a nor m/b have a remainder of 0, the function returns "Neither divisible". Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to check the divisibility of n and m by a and b respectively, and return the corresponding message based on the divisibility. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the divisibility of n and m by a and b respectively and returns a message based on the divisibility status.**
