#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are all integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters. It is supposed to calculate the divisibility of two integers `n` and `m` by `a` and `b` respectively, and return a message based on the divisibility status. However, the function lacks implementation code inside the function block, so currently, it does not perform any calculations.
