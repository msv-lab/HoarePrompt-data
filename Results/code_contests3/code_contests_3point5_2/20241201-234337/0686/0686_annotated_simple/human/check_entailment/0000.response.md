Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it defines a function without any implementation, which is acceptable as the function's implementation is not provided in the annotated program. The program is expected to calculate the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations, making the number of boxes divisible by m. Since the implementation is not provided, we cannot assess if it follows the problem description.
