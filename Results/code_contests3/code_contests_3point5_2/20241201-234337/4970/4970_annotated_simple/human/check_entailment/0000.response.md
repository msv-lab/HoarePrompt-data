Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input and uses it as an index to access a specific element from a predefined list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The program correctly outputs the element at the specified index in the list. Hence, the program is correct for all possible inputs (0 to 15).
