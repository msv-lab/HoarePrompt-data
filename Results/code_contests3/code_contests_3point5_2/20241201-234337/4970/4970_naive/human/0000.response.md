Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program takes an integer input and directly uses it as an index to retrieve the corresponding value from a pre-defined list. Since the input is guaranteed to be between 0 and 15 (inclusive), and the list contains 16 elements, the program covers all possible input cases. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
