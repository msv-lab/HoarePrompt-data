The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input arguments. The function returns a string value based on the following conditions:
- If the value of `a` is between 0 and 5 (inclusive), the function returns "Low range".
- If the value of `a` is between 6 and 10 (inclusive), the function returns "Medium range".
- If the value of `a` is between 11 and 15 (inclusive), the function returns "High range".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the range in which the integer `a` falls and return a corresponding string value. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns different strings based on the value of the integer `a` as follows: "Low range" if 0 ≤ a ≤ 5, "Medium range" if 6 ≤ a ≤ 10, and "High range" if 11 ≤ a ≤ 15.**
