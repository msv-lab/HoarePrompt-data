Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the element from the list based on the integer input. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is an integer between 0 and 15, the input value should be within this range. The list index is determined by the input, so the output state will be the same as the initial state with the printed element corresponding to the input value.
Output State: **a is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15 and the element from the list based on the input value is printed.**
