Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and prints a value from a predefined list based on the input. The value printed is the element at the index corresponding to the input value in the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The code covers all possible inputs from 0 to 15 as specified in the problem description. There are no edge cases where the code does not behave as expected. The output hints also align with the functionality of the code, confirming that it follows the requirements.
