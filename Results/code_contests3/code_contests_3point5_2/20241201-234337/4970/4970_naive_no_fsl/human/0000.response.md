Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input and then uses it as an index to access a specific element from a list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input is restricted to the range 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, and the list has 16 elements, the program covers all possible inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
