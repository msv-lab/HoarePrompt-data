#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15.**
def func():
    print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes user input and prints the element at the corresponding index from a predefined list. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it indirectly relies on user input. The function does not return any values.
