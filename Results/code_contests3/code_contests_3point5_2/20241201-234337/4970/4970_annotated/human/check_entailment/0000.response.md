Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func` that takes user input and prints the element at the corresponding index from a predefined list. The predefined list contains the numbers from 0 to 15 in a specific order. Since the input value is guaranteed to be between 0 and 15, the program will always correctly output the corresponding number from the list, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
