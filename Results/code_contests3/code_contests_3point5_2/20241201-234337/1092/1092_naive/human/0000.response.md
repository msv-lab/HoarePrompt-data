Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input, splits the text into words, and then iterates through each word to count the number of capital letters in each word. It then keeps track of the maximum number of capital letters found in any word. Finally, it prints out this maximum number as the volume of the text. The program follows the problem description accurately and correctly calculates the volume of the given text for all potential cases.
