Output State: **`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and 1, `l` remains unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 1 more than the previous value of `s`, `j` is the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over, or None if there are no more uppercase characters in `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be an iterable object and the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over must be followed by at least one more uppercase character**
