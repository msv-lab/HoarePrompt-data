According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If there are more elements in the list `l`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `l` must have more elements, and `i` should point to the next element in the list.
State: **`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is unchanged**
