Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `s` and the current value of `m`. The previous values of `m`, `l`, `i`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged**
