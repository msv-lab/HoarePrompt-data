According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more elements in `i`, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is an uppercase character. 
So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have more elements, and `j` must point to the next uppercase character in the list.
State: **`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the next uppercase character in `i`**
