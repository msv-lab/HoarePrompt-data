Postcondition: ***`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and 3, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 3, `j` is the next uppercase character in `i` if the condition `j.isupper()` is true, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must have more elements to iterate over.***
