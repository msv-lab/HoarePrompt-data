Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and `s`, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over, or None if there are no more uppercase characters in `i`, for the loop to execute `i` must be an iterable object. The last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over is an uppercase character.
Output State: **`m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and 1, `l` is unchanged, `i` points to the next element in the list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over, or None if there are no more uppercase characters in `i`, for the loop to execute `i` must be an iterable object.
