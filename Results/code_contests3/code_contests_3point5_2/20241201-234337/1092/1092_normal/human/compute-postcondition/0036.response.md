Postcondition: ***`m`, `l`, `i`, `s`, `j` are variables. `m` is the maximum between the previous value of `m` and 1. `l` remains unchanged. `i` points to the next element in the list `l`. `s` is 1. `j` is the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over, or None if there are no more uppercase characters in `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be an iterable object and the last uppercase character in `i` that the loop iterates over is an uppercase character.***
