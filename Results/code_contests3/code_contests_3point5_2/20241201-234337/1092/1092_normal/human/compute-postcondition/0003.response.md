According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is a list with at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in the list.
State: **`m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list**
