The function `func` reads input, splits it into a list, and then iterates over each sublist to count the number of uppercase characters in each sublist. It keeps track of the maximum count of uppercase characters found in any sublist. Finally, it prints out this maximum count. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
