According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `l` contains at least one word. Since `n` is the number of words in the list `l`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0, which does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, and `i` is the first word in the list `l`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is the first word in the list `l`**
