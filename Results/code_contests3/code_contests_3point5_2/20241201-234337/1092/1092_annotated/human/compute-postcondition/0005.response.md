According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l`. If the list `l` has at least one word, the loop can execute. For the loop to be executed successfully, `j` should iterate over each character in the word `i`. At the start of the loop, `s` should be 0. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` iterates over each character in the word `i`**
