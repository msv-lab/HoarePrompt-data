Example Answer:
The variable `m` is assigned the value 0. The list `l` containing n words remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0**
