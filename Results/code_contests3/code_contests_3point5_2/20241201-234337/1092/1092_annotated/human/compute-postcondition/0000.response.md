Example Answer:
The code snippet `raw_input()` reads input from the user, but it does not assign this input to any variable. Since the initial state does not specify any variables to store this input, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The text consists of n single-space separated words, each word containing only small and capital Latin letters.**
