According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is a word in `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing n+1 words, `m` is the count of uppercase characters in the last word in list l, `i` is the last word in list l, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in all words in list l increased by 1, and `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the last word in list l increased by 1. The last word `j` in list `l` is uppercase. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the last word in list `l` should contain `j` as one of its words.
State: **n is greater than 0, l is a list containing n+1 words, m is the count of uppercase characters in the last word in list l, i is the last word in list l, s is the total count of uppercase characters in all words in list l increased by 1, s is the count of uppercase characters in the last word in list l increased by 1, the last word j in list l is uppercase and j is a word in i**
