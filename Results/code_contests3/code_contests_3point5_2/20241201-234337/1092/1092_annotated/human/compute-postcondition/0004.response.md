Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing n words, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
