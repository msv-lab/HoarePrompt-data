Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the list of words obtained by splitting the input based on spaces. Since the input consists of n single-space separated words, after execution, the list `l` will contain n words. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list containing n words.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `l` is a list containing n words**
