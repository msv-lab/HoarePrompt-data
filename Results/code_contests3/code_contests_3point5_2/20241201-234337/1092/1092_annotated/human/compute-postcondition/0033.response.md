According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is the second last word in the list `l`, it needs to be a valid word. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least two words. In addition, the loop will execute for each character in the word `i`. Thus, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is the maximum value between the sum of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and the count of uppercase characters in the second last word in list `l`, `i` is the second last word in list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in all words in list `l` and equal to the sum of uppercase characters in all words in list `l`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is a valid word and `j` is each character in the word `i`.**
