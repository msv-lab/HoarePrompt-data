Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 200. It then reads a text consisting of `n` single-space separated words, where each word contains only small and capital Latin letters. For each word, the function counts the number of uppercase letters and determines the maximum count of uppercase characters in any word. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase characters found in any word. **
