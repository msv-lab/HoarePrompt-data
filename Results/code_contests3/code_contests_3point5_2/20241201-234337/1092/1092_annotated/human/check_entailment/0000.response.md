Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a text consisting of `n` single-space separated words, where each word contains only small and capital Latin letters. It then calculates the volume of the text by finding the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word and prints it. This matches the requirements of the problem description. The program iterates through each word, counts the uppercase letters, and updates the maximum count accordingly. Finally, it prints the maximum count, which is the volume of the text.
