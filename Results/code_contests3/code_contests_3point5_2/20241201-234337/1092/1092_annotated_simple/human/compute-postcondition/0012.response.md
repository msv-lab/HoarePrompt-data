According to the code, the loop can execute if the iterable `i` is not exhausted. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 2. Since `i` is the first word in the list, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should move to the next word in the list. The states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 2**
