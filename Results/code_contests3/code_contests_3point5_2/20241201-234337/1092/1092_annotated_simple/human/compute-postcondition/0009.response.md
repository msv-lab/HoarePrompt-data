According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are characters left in the first word in the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the characters of the first word in the list `l`, to execute one more time, there must be characters left in the first word `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time there must be characters left in the first word in the list `l`**
