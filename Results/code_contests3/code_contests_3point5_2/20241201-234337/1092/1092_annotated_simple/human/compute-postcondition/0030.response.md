Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in the word `i` and the current value of `m`. The maximum value is taken between `s` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in the word `i`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in the word `i`.**
