According to the code, the loop will execute for each word in the list `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `l` contains n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in the word `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next word in the list `l` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state adjustments are as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in the word `i`**
