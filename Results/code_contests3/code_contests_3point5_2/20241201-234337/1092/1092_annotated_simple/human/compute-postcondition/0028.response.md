Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is increased by 1 if the next character `j` in `i` is uppercase, and `j` has more characters in `i` to iterate over.***
