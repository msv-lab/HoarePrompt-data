According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the word `i`. If there are more characters left in the word `i`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list containing n words, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is increased by 1 if `j` is uppercase.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to have more characters left to iterate over.
- `s` needs to be adjusted based on the next character in `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is increased by 1 if the next character `j` in `i` is uppercase.**
