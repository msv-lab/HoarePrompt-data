According to the code, the loop will execute for each word in the list `l`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the last word in the list, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the following states:
- `n` remains the same as the number of words in the list `l`.
- `l` remains the same list with n words.
- `i` will now become the next word in the list after the current last word.
- `m` and `s` may or may not change depending on the characters in the next word.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list after the current last word, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list**
