Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 3**
