According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the word `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list `l` with at least 1 character, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is the characters in the word `i`, the next character `j` is an uppercase character. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the next word in the list `l` with at least 1 character, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`, `s` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is the characters in the word `i`, the next character `j` is an uppercase character and there are still characters left in the word `i`**.
