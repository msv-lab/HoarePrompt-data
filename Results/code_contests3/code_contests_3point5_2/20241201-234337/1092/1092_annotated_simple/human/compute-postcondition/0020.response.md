Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is a valid word from the list `l`, `m` is the maximum value between the total count of uppercase characters in all words in the list and 0, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` should be a valid word from the list `l`. If `j` is uppercase, then the program state remains the same with the additional condition that `j` is uppercase.***
