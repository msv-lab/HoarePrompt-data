According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l` containing words. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list, and `m` remains 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0**
