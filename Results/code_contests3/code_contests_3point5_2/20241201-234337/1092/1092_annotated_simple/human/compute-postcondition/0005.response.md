According to the code, the loop will iterate over the characters of the first word in the list `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- The list `l` must contain at least 1 word.
- The variable `i` must be the first word in the list `l`.
- The variables `m` and `s` should stay the same as they are not involved in the loop condition.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `j` is the characters of the first word in the list `l`**
