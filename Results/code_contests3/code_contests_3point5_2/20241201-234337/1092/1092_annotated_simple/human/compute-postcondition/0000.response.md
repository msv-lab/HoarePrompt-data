Example Answer:
The code `raw_input()` reads an input from the user, but it doesn't affect any variables in the program. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200. The text consists of n single-space separated words, where each word consists of small and capital Latin letters.**
