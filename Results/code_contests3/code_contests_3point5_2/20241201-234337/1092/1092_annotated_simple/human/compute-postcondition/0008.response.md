Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200, `l` is a list containing n words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute `j` is the characters of the first word in the list `l`. If the characters of the first word in the list `l` are uppercase, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the program state.***
