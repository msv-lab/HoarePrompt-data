The function `func` reads an input string that contains a set of letters enclosed in curly braces, separated by commas and spaces. It then creates a list `Arreglo` by extracting elements from the input string based on a specific pattern. The function prints the number of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a specific output.
