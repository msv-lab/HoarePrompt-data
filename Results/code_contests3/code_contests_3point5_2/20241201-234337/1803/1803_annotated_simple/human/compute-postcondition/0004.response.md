Example Answer: 
`Arreglo` is appended with the element `Cadena[k]`, where `k` is 1. Since `k` is 1, the element at index 1 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`**
