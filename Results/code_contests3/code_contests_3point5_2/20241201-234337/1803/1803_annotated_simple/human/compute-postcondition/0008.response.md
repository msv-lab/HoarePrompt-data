Example Answer: 
`k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but since `k` is incremented by 3, the new value of `k` will be 3 more than the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains the elements `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[k]`, `Cadena[k+3]`, `Cadena[k+6]`, ..., where `k` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the elements `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[k]`, `Cadena[k+3]`, `Cadena[k+6]`, ..., where `k` is incremented by 3**
