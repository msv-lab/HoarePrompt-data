According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. At the end of the previous iteration, `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, and `k` is incremented by 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted such that it is less than the length of `Cadena`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is incremented by 3, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`**
