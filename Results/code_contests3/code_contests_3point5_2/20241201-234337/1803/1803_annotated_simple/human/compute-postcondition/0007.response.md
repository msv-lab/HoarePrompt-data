Example Answer:
The element at index `k` of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo`. Since `k` is incremented by 3, the next element to be added will be at index `k+3`. As long as `k` is less than the length of `Cadena`, the loop will continue executing. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains the elements `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[k]`, `Cadena[k+3]`, `Cadena[k+6]`, ..., `k` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the elements `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[k]`, `Cadena[k+3]`, `Cadena[k+6]`, ..., `k` is incremented by 3**
