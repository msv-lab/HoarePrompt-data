Example Answer:
The code appends the element at index `k` of `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`. Since `k` is incremented by 3 each time, it means the loop will execute again with the next element at index `k+3` of `Cadena`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains elements based on the pattern, `k` is incremented by 3 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains elements based on the pattern, `k` is incremented by 3 for the loop to execute again**
