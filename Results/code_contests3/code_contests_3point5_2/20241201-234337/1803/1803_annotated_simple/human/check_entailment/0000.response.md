Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program incorrectly assumes that the input string will always have elements at positions that are multiples of 3, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The program also does not handle cases where there are repeated letters in the set.

Therefore, the program does not always count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set accurately.
