The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` is less than the length of Cadena, the new value of `k` is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k+3 from Cadena.
Output State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k+3 from Cadena**
