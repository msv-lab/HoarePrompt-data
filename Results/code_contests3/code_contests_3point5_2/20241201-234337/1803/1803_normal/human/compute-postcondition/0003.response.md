According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string Cadena and the value of k. If the length of Cadena is greater than k and also greater than 2, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo is an empty list, and k is 1. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the length of Cadena must be greater than 1 (k + 1) and also greater than 2. So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- Cadena length should be greater than 1
- k should be less than the length of Cadena
- Cadena length should be greater than 2

State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas with length greater than 1, Arreglo is an empty list, k is less than the length of Cadena and Cadena length is greater than 2**
