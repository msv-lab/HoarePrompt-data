Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the new value of `k` is updated to be k + 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is checked based on the length of Cadena being greater than k+1 and greater than 2. Arreglo is then updated to include the value at index k from Cadena. 
Output State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k from Cadena.**
