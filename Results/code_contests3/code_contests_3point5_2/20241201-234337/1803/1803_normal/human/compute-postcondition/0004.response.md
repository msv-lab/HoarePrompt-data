Example Answer:
The value at index k in Cadena is added to the Arreglo list. Since Arreglo was initially empty, it now contains the value at index k from Cadena. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k from Cadena, k is less than the length of Cadena.
Output State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k from Cadena, k is less than the length of Cadena**
