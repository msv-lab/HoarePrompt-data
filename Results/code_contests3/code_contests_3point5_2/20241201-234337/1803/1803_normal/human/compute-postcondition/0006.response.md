According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Cadena` and `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, and Arreglo contains the value at index k+3 from Cadena. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the length of Cadena should be greater than k+1 and also greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters separated by commas, Arreglo contains the value at index k+3 from Cadena, for the loop to execute again the length of Cadena is greater than k+1 and greater than 2**
