Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code is not correctly counting the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers the first occurrence of each letter and ignores any duplicates. For example, for the input "{b, a, b, a}", the code will output 2 instead of 3 because it only counts the distinct letters once. The code does not handle cases where the same letter appears multiple times in the set.
