Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set as described in the problem description. The program reads a line of input consisting of a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces. It then creates a list `Arreglo` containing elements at specific indexes of the input line based on the loop condition. Finally, it prints the count of unique elements in `Arreglo`.

However, the program does not account for duplicates in the input set. It only retrieves elements at specific indexes in the input line which may result in counting duplicates multiple times. Therefore, the program does not accurately calculate the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. 

For example, if the input is "{b, a, b, a}", the program would output 2 instead of the correct answer which is 2. 

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
