Example Answer:
Arreglo is assigned the value of Arreglo concatenated with the element at index 5 of Cadena. Since k is 5, the element at index 5 of Cadena is selected. Therefore, the updated Arreglo will now contain the element at index 4 of Cadena and the element at index 5 of Cadena. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **Cadena is a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo is a list containing the element at index 4 and index 5 of Cadena; k is 5**
