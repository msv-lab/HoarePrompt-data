Example Answer:
The code appends the element at index 8 of Cadena to the list Arreglo. Given that k is 8, the element at index 8 of Cadena will be appended to Arreglo. Therefore, the Output State is: Cadena is a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo contains the elements at index 4, 5, and 8 of Cadena.
Output State: **Cadena is a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo contains the elements at index 4, 5, and 8 of Cadena**
