According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of Cadena and the value of k. The loop will execute if the length of Cadena is greater than k and greater than 2. Right before the loop, Cadena is a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo is an empty list; k is 1. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, Cadena needs to have a length greater than 1 (k) and greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Cadena is a set of letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo is an empty list; k is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, Cadena needs to have a length greater than 1 (k) and greater than 2**
