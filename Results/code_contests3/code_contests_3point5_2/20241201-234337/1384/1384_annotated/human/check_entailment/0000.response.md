Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input, divides `t` by `x`, and prints the result. This matches the requirement of calculating how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. The constraints and input/output format are also met. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
