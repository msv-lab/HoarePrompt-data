Example Answer: 
t and x are assigned the values returned by map(float, input().split()), where map(float, input().split()) takes input and splits it into separate values, converting each to a float. Since the initial values of T and X are integers between 1 and 100, after execution, t and x will be floating-point numbers. Therefore, the Output State is: t and x are floating-point numbers.
Output State: **t and x are floating-point numbers**
