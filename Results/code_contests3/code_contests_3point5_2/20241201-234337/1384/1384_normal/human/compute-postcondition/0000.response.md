Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the value of float conversion of input split by space. The input values are integers, so after execution, `t` and `x` will have the same integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100**
