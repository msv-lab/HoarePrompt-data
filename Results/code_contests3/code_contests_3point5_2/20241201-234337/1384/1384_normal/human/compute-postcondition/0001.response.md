Example Answer:
The code prints the result of dividing `T` by `X`. The values of `T` and `X` are integers between 1 and 100. Therefore, the output state is: `T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100**
