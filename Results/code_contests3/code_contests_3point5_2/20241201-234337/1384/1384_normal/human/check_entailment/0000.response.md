Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the user input, divides `t` by `x`, and prints the result. This aligns with the problem description, which states that while (X * t) hours pass in World B, t hours pass in World A. Therefore, the code correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. Additionally, the code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ T ≤ 100, 1 ≤ X ≤ 100) and produces the expected output.
