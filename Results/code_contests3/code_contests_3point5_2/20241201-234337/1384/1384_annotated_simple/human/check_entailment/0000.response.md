Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly takes two integer inputs, T and X, and then converts them to floats using the map function. It then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. The program then prints the result.

This program follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A based on the given values of T and X. The output is also formatted as required with 10 decimal places. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
