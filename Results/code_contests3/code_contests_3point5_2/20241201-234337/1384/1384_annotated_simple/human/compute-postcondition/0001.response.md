Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the result of dividing `t` by `x`. The values of `T` and `X` are not affected by this operation, only `t` and `x` are used to calculate the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, `t` and `x` are input floats and the result of t / x is printed.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, `t` and `x` are input floats and the result of t / x is printed**
