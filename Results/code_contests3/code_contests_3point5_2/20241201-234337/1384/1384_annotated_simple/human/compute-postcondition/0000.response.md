Example Answer: 
`t` and `x` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to float. Since the input is split by spaces, there should be two values provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, `t` and `x` are input floats.
Output State: **`T` and `X` are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100, `t` and `x` are input floats**
