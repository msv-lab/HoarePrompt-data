The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input, divides `t` by `x`, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The annotations mention constraints on the input values `T` and `X`, but the program does not enforce these constraints or handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified requirements.
