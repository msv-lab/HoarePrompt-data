Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values N, Q, S, l_i, and r_i. It then calculates the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring in the specified substring of S for each query and prints the result. The logic of the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description accurately. The program iterates through the string S to count the occurrences of 'AC' up to each index i and stores the count in the list P. Then, for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences in the specified substring by subtracting the count at index l from the count at index r. Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases and provide the correct output.
