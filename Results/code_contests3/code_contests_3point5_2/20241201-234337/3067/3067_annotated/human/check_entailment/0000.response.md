Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly reads the input values N, Q, and S. It then creates a list P where each element represents the number of consecutive 'AC' substrings ending at that index in S. The program then processes Q queries by reading pairs of integers l and r, and prints the difference between the elements at index r - 1 and l - 1 of list P.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately calculates the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring in the given substrings of S. The implementation is correct for all potential cases and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
