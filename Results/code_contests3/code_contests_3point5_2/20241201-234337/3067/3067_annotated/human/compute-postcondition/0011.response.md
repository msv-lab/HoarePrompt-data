Example Answer: 
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `i` is currently 0. Since P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0, and we are at the beginning of the loop or statement where i = 0, `P[i]` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, i is 0, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0, and P[0] is assigned the value 0.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, i is 0, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0, P[0] is assigned the value 0**
