Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, i starts at 0, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0. If i is equal to 0, P[0] is assigned the value 0. The condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] != 'AC') is true and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
