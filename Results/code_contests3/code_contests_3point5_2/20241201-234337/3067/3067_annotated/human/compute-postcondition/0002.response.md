Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of length N+1, where each element is 0. The values of N and Q are already assigned based on the input, and S is assigned a value based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q have their assigned values, S has its assigned value based on user input, and P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0.
Output State: **N and Q have their assigned values, S has its assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0**
