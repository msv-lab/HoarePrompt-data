Output State: **N is a positive integer, i is increased by 1, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with the first element being 0. If S[i:i + 2] == 'AC', the value at index i in list P is incremented by 1 compared to the previous element. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. If i == 0, then the value at index i in list P is set to 0.**
