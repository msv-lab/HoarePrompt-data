According to the code, the loop can execute as long as Q is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, N is a positive integer, S has a valid assigned value, and P is a list of length N+1. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to Q is greater than 0.
State: **N is a positive integer, S has a valid assigned value, P is a list of length N+1, for the loop to execute Q is greater than 0**
