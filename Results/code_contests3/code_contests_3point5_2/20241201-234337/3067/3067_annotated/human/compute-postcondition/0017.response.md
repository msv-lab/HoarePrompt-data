Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Since i is increased by 1, P[i] will be P[i - 1] + 1. The initial state mentions that P is a list of length N+1 with the first element being 0, so P[i - 1] will be the previous element in the list. Therefore, after execution, the value at index i in list P will be incremented by 1 compared to the previous element.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, i is increased by 1, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with the first element being 0 and the value at index i in list P is incremented by 1 compared to the previous element.**
