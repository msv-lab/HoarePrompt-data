Since the loop will execute N times, the key state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are:
- N is a positive integer
- i starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration
- S has a valid assigned value based on user input
- P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0

State: **N is a positive integer, `i` starts at 0, S has a valid assigned value based on user input, P is a list of length N+1 with each element being 0**
