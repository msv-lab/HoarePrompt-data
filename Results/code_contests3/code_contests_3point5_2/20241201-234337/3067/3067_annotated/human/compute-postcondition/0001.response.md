Example Answer:
The value of `S` is assigned based on the input received through `raw_input()`. The values of `N` and `Q` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values based on the input, S is assigned a value based on user input.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values based on the input, S is assigned a value based on user input**
