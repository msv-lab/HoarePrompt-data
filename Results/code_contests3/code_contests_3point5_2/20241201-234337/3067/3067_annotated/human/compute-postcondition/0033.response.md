Example Answer:
The value at index r-1 in list P is subtracted from the value at index l-1 in list P, and the result is printed. The values of N, S, P, Q, l, and r remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S has a valid assigned value, P is a list of length N+1, Q is greater than 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S has a valid assigned value, P is a list of length N+1, Q is greater than 0, l and r are assigned values based on user input**
