Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between the element at index `r - 1` and the element at index `l - 1` of list `P`. The values of `l` and `r` are assigned from the input, and the result of the calculation is printed. Since the initial state mentions that the result of the calculation is 0, it implies that `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` are equal. Therefore, if the calculation result is 0, it means that `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` have the same value.

Output State: **All variables remain the same, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting, and the elements at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` of list `P` have the same value.**
