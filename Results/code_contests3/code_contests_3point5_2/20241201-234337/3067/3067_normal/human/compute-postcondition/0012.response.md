Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1 and i is increased by 1 for the loop to execute the next time. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC', P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1], and i remains the same.***
