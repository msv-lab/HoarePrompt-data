Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements, all initialized to 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, i is 0, P[0] is 0. The program continues to execute without any changes in the variables. Additionally, the substring S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC', P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].**
