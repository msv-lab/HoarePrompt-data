Example Answer:
N and Q are assigned values from the input after splitting it. Since the values are integers, they are converted to integers using the map function. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N**
