Functionality: **The function `func` implicitly accepts positive integers N and Q, a string S of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and integers l_i and r_i such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. It reads input values, processes the string S to create a list P where each element represents the count of occurrences of 'AC' substring up to that index. Then, for each query (l, r), it prints the difference P[r-1] - P[l-1]. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
