The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly mentioned. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, the function implicitly accepts positive integers N and Q, a string S of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and integers l_i and r_i such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. The function does not explicitly return any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on the implicitly accepted parameters N, Q, S, l_i, and r_i based on the provided constraints, without explicitly returning any value.
