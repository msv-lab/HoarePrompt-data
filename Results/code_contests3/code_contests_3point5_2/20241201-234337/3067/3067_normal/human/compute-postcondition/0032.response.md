Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `l` and `r` are based on the input provided. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting, and the result of the calculation is 0.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting, and the result of the calculation is 0.**
