According to the code, the loop will execute N times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute:
State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements, all initialized to 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
