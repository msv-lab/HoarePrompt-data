Example Answer:
The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements, P[0] is 0**
