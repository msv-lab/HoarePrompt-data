According to the code, the loop will execute Q times. Since the result of the calculation is 0 and all variables remain the same, the loop will execute again if Q is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **All variables remain the same, and the result of the calculation is 0, for the loop to execute once more Q must be greater than 0**
