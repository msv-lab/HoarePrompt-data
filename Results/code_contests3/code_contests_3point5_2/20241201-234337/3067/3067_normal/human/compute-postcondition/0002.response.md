Example Answer:
The list P is initialized to have N+1 elements, all initialized to 0. Since N is a positive integer, the length of the list P will be N+1. The variables N, Q, S, l_i, and r_i are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string from raw_input(), P is a list of N+1 elements, all initialized to 0.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', and l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string from raw_input(), P is a list of N+1 elements, all initialized to 0**
