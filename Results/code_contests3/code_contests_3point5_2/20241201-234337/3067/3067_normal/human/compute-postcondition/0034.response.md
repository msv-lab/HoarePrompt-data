According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Q`. If `Q` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting, and the elements at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` of list `P` have the same value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `Q` must be greater than the current iteration count.
State: **All variables remain the same, `l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting, and the elements at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` of list `P` have the same value, `Q` is greater than the current iteration count**
