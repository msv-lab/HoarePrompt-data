According to the code, the loop will execute Q times based on the variable Q. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements where all elements are 0, for the loop to execute Q times**
