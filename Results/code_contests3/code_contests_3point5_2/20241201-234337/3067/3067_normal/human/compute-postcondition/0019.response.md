Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements where all elements are 0 if S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC'. Otherwise, P is a list of N+1 elements with values from 0 to N where the element at index i is equal to i.***
