Postcondition: ***N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is equal to 'AC', then P is a list of N+1 elements with values from 0 to N where the element at index i is equal to i and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `N`. `P[0]` is 0 and `P[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if S[i - 1:i + 1] is not equal to 'AC', then P is a list of N+1 elements where all elements are 0 and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `N`. `P[0]` is 0 and `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]***.
