Example Answer:
P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Since P[0] is 0, P[1] becomes 1, P[2] becomes 2, and so on until P[N] becomes N. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements with values from 0 to N.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements with values from 0 to N**
