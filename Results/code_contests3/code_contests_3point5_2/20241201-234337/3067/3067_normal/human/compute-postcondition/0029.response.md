Example Answer:
l and r are assigned values obtained by splitting the input. The values of l and r are integers within the range of 1 to N. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements where all elements are 0, and l, r are integers within the specified range.
Output State: **N and Q are positive integers, S is a string of length N with characters 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T', l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of N+1 elements where all elements are 0, and l, r are integers within the specified range**.
