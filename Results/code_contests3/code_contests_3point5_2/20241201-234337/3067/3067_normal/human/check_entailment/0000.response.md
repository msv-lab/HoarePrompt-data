Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values N, Q, S and processes the string S to create a list P where each element represents the count of occurrences of 'AC' substring up to that index.
- For each query (l, r), it prints the difference P[r-1] - P[l-1], which gives the count of 'AC' substring in the substring of S from index l to index r.
- The code logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints provided. It covers all possible cases and correctly calculates the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring in the given substrings.
