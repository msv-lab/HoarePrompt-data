Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of times the substring 'AC' occurs in the given range for each query. It uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently calculate the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the string S. The program iterates through the string S once to build the prefix sum array P, where P[i] stores the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index i. Then, for each query (l, r), it simply calculates the difference P[r - 1] - P[l - 1] to get the count of 'AC' occurrences in the given range. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all constraints mentioned in the problem statement.
