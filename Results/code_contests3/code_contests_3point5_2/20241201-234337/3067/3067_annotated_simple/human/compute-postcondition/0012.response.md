Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value based on the input, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros with the first element being 0, and i is 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value P[i - 1] + 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] is not 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
