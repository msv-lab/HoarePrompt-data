Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of (N+1) zeros. The values of N and Q are based on the input provided, and S is a string input. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros**
