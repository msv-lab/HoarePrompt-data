Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value based on the input, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros with the first element being 0, i is 0, and if the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is met, the substring of S from index i-1 to index i+1 is 'AC'. P[i] is assigned the value P[i - 1] + 1.**
