Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value based on the input, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros with the first element being 0, and i is 0. When the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is met, the program state remains the same with the added condition that the substring of S from index i-1 to index i+1 is 'AC'.***
