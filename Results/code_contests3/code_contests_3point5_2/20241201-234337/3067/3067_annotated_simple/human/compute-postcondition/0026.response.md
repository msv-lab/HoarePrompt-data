Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value, S is a string input, P has updated values according to the condition, i is incremented by 1. If i == 0, variable P[0] is assigned the value 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next line of code. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] is assigned the value P[i - 1] + 1. If the condition is not met, P[i] retains the previous value of P[i - 1].***
