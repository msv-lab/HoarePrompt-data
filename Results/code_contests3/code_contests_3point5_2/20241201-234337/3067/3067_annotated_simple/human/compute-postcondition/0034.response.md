According to the code, the loop can execute Q times. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input and the result of the subtraction operation. To execute the loop one more time, the values of `l` and `r` need to be adjusted based on the loop iteration.
State: **`l`, `r` need to be adjusted based on the next iteration of the loop**
