Example Answer:
P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. Since i is 1, P[1] will take the value of P[0], which is 0. Therefore, after execution, P is a list of (N+1) zeros with the first element being 0, and i is 1.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value, S is a string input, P is a list of (N+1) zeros with the first element being 0, i is 1**
