The code calculates the difference between the value at index `r - 1` and the value at index `l - 1` in list `P`. The values of `l` and `r` are based on the input received. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r` are assigned values based on the input received.
Output State: **`l`, `r` are assigned values based on the input received**
