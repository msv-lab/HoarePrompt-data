Example Answer:
The value of `r` and `l` are used to slice the list `P`. The result is the difference between the element at index `r - 1` and the element at index `l - 1` in list `P`. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input and the result of the subtraction operation.
Output State: **`l`, `r` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input and the result of the subtraction operation**
