Example Answer:
The code calculates the cumulative count of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the string S based on the values stored in the list P. It then prints the difference between the value at index r-1 and the value at index l-1 of list P. The variables l and r are used as indices to access specific elements in the list P. Therefore, the Output State is: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, P contains the cumulative count of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the string S, for the loop to execute Q is greater than 0; l, r are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input and the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed.
