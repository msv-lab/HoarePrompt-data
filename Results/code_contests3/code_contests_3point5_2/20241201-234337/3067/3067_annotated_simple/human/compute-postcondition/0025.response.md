Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. Since i is incremented by 1 initially, if i == 0 condition is not met, and the value of P[0] remains unchanged. Therefore, after execution, the value of P[i] is equal to the previous value of P[i - 1], and the states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned a value, S is a string input, P has updated values according to the condition, i is incremented by 1, P[i] is equal to the previous value of P[i - 1]**
