Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the given problem description. It initializes a list `P` to keep track of the cumulative count of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions in the string `S`. Then, it iterates through the string `S` to calculate these counts and stores them in the list `P`.

After that, for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substring by taking the difference between the cumulative counts at the end index `r` and the start index `l`.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly counts the occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substrings for each query.
