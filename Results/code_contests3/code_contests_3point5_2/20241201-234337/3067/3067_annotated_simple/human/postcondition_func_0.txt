The function reads input values N, Q, and a string S. It then processes the string S to determine the cumulative count of occurrences where the substring 'AC' appears in consecutive positions. For each query specified by input values l and r, it prints the difference between the cumulative count at position r-1 and the cumulative count at position l-1. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the results of the queries based on the processed string S.
