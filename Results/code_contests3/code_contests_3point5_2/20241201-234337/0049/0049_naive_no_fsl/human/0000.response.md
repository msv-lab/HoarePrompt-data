Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and checks if there exists a character in `s` such that it is greater than the next character. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and the indices of the substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The logic implemented in the code aligns with the problem description provided. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the code logic, the program is correct for all potential cases.
