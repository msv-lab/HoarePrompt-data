Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `c`. It then iterates through the list `c` and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the first occurrence. If no such pair exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it outputs the results based on the conditions met during execution.**
