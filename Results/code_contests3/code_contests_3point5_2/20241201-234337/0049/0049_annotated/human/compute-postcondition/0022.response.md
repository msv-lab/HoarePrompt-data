Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the input list of integers, `flag` is False if there is no pair of elements in the list where the previous element is greater than the next element, `pos` contains the index of the first occurrence where the previous element is greater than the next element if `flag` is True. The program prints 'NO' and does not affect the state of the variables.**
