Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is reassigned to the first element of the list `n`. If the initial `n` list had multiple elements, after execution, `n` will only contain the first element of the initial list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now the first element of the original list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is now the first element of the original list of integers**
