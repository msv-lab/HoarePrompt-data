Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts an input and splits it based on whitespace, then `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers**
