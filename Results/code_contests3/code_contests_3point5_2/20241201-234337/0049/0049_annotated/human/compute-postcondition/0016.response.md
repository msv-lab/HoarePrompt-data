Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the input list of integers, `flag` is True, `i` is the next value in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met, then `pos` is updated to the value of `i` and `flag` remains True. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
