According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `c`, and the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first element of the original list of integers, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the input from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, `i` is the next value in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `pos` is updated to the value of `i` if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the new values should be as follows:
State: **`n` is the first element of the original list of integers, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the input from `raw_input()`, `flag` is True, `i` is the next value in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `pos` is updated to the value of `i` if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is met**.
