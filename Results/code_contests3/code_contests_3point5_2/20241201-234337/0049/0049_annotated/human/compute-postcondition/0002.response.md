Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of the input from `raw_input()`. The value of `n` is the first element of the original list of integers, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now the first element of the original list of integers, `c` is the input from `raw_input()`.
Output State: **`n` is now the first element of the original list of integers, `c` is the input from `raw_input()`**
