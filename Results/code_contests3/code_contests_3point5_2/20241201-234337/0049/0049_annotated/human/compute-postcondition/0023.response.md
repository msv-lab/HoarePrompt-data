Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the input list of integers. If `flag` is True, then there exists at least one pair of elements in the list where the previous element is greater than the next element, and `pos` contains the index of the first such occurrence. The program prints `pos + 1, pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, there is no pair of elements in the list where the previous element is greater than the next element. The program prints 'NO' and does not affect the state of the variables.***
