Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The program only checks if there exists a pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the next element, and if found, it prints the indices of that pair. However, the problem description requires finding a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less.

Therefore, the program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It does not find a suitable substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. As a result, the correctness of the program is False.
