Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if there exists a character in the string that is greater than the next character. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and the indices that need to be reversed. If no such character is found, it prints "NO". The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, it provides the correct output.
