The function `func` reads input from the user, processes it to find if there is a decreasing sequence in a given string, and prints 'YES' followed by the positions if such a sequence exists, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. However, the current implementation only checks for a decreasing sequence and does not handle cases where the sequence is non-decreasing or where multiple decreasing sequences exist.
