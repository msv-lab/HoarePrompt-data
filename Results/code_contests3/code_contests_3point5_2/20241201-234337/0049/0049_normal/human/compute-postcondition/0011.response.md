Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. Since `i` is 1, after execution, `pos` will also be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1.
Output State: **`flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1**
