Example Answer: 
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `pos` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is 2.
Output State: **`flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `pos` is 2**
