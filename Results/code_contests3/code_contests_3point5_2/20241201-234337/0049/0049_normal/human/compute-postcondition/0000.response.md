Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input obtained by splitting the raw input. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python and `split()` is used for strings, this code snippet will not execute correctly. Therefore, the output state is: Error in code execution.
Output State: **Error in code execution**
