Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to n-2, `pos` is either the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]` or 0 if no such occurrence exists. If `flag` is true, 'YES' is printed on the console along with pos + 1 and pos + 2. If `flag` is false, 'NO' is printed on the console.***
