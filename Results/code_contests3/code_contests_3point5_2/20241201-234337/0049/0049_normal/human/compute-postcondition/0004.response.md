According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than or equal to 2, since n - 1 needs to be at least 1 for the loop to iterate. Before the loop starts, `flag` being False does not directly impact the loop execution. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
