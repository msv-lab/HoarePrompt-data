Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the string and checks if there exists a pair of adjacent characters where the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the pair. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO". This aligns perfectly with the requirements stated in the problem description.
