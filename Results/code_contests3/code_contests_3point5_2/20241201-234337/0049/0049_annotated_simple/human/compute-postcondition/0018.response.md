Postcondition: ***`c` is assigned the user input as a string, `flag` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in `c` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the index of the last iteration, and `pos` is assigned the index of the last occurrence where the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is true. If no such pair exists, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not updated. Additionally, `flag` is True.***
