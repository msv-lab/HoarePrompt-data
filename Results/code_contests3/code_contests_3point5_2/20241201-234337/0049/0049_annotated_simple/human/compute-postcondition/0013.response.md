According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is assigned the user input as a string, `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is true. 
So for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`c` is assigned the user input as a string, `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i` if the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is true.**
