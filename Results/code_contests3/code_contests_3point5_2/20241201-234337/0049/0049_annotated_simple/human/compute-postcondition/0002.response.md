Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value `raw_input()`. `raw_input()` is a Python 2 function used for accepting user input as a string. Since the initial state does not mention what `n` is, the output state will only include the information about `c` being assigned the user input as a string.
Output State: **`c` is assigned the user input as a string**
