Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` as user input. It then iterates over the characters of the string to check if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters where the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to True and stores the index of the last occurrence in `pos`. Finally, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the identified pair if `flag` is True, otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates within the constraints specified.**
