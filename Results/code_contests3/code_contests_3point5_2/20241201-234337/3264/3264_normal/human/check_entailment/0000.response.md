Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code does not handle the case when n is odd properly. The code tries to calculate m and k based on specific formulas, but it does not print them correctly. The code uses the division operator "/" instead of the floor division operator "//" for integer division. This can lead to incorrect results for odd values of n.

2. The code also does not handle the case when n is even correctly. Similar to the odd case, the code does not perform integer division when calculating m and k for even values of n.

3. The code does not print the calculated values of m and k. The code uses parentheses around the print statements which does not correspond to the correct syntax in Python.

Based on these points, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
