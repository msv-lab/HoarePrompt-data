Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user using `raw_input()`. The input is converted to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 109) and `n` is the user-input integer.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 109); `n` is the user-input integer**
