Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, there is no change in the state of the program variables. If `n` is a positive integer larger than 2, two calculated integer values are obtained based on the expressions provided. If `n` is a positive odd integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 109), values of the expressions are calculated based on the formula provided.***
