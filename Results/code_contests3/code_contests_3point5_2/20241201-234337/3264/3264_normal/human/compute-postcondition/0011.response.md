Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and performs calculations based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer, it calculates two integer values based on specific formulas and prints them. If `n` is a positive even integer, it calculates two integer values using different formulas and prints them. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**
