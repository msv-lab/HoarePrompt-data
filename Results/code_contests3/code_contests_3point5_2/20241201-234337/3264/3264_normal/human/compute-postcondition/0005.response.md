Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, both expressions will result in integer values. Therefore, the output state is the two calculated integer values.
Output State: **Two calculated integer values based on the expressions provided**
