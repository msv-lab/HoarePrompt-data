Example Answer:
The expression `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1` are calculated where `n` is an odd number. Since `n` is an odd number, `n * n / 4` will result in a whole number. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive odd integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 109), the values of the expressions are calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 109), values of the expressions are calculated based on the formula**
