Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program should output two integers m and k such that n, m, and k form a Pythagorean triple. However, the program does not output m and k as required. Instead, it calculates and prints different expressions based on the parity of n, which do not necessarily form a Pythagorean triple.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.
