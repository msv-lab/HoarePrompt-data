Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it attempts to print -1 with a syntax error due to missing parentheses in the print statement. For `n` larger than 2, it calculates specific expressions based on the parity of `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, it prints n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. The function does not have a return value.**
