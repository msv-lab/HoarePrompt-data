Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n ≤ 2, there is a syntax error due to missing parentheses in the print statement. If n is larger than 2, then based on the parity of n, specific expressions are evaluated. If n is odd, the expressions (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2 give specific values. If n is even, the expressions n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1 are displayed.***
