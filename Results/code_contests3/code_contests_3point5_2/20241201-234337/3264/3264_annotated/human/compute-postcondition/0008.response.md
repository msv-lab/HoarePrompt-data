Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and n is larger than 2. If n is odd, then the expressions (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2 evaluate to specific values based on the value of n. If n is even, the result of the expression n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1 are displayed.***
