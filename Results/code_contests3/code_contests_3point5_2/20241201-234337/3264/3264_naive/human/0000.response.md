Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program contains syntax errors and logical errors. The syntax error is the missing parentheses in the `print` statements. The logical error is in the calculation of the Pythagorean triples. The correct formula for finding Pythagorean triples when `n` is an odd number is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`, and when `n` is an even number is `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. However, in the program, the output is not properly assigned to variables and there are missing `print` statements.

Example:
Input
6

Output
8 9

For the input `6`, the expected output should be `8 10`, but the program gives `8 9`, which is incorrect.
