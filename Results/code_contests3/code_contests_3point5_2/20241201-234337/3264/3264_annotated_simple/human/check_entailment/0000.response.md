Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an input integer `n`, checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and prints -1 if that condition is met. If `n` is greater than 2, it then calculates and prints two integers `m` and `k` such that they form a Pythagorean triple with the input integer `n`. 

The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct in all cases.
