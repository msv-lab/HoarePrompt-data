Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and performs calculations based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function prints -1. If `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an odd number, the function calculates and prints two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is an even number, the function calculates and prints two values: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1.**
