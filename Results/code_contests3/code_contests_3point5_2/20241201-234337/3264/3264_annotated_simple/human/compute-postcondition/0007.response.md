Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is an odd number, `n * n` will be odd as well. Therefore, `(n * n / 4 - 1)` will result in an odd number subtracted by 1 which gives an even number. Similarly, `(n * n / 4 + 1)` will result in an odd number added by 1 which gives an even number. The output state would be: `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an odd number, the result of the first calculation is an even number, and the result of the second calculation is an even number.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an odd number, the result of the first calculation is an even number, and the result of the second calculation is an even number**
