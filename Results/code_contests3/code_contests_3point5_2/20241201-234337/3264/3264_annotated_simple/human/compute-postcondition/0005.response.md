Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since `n` is an odd number, both expressions will result in integers. The first expression will be (n^2 - 1) / 2, and the second expression will be (n^2 + 1) / 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an odd number.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and an odd number**
