Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given parameters of acceleration, distance, and initial speed. The logic used to calculate the arrival time for each trolleybus is in accordance with the problem description. The program iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time taken to reach the final station, and updates the maximum time taken so far. It then prints out the arrival time for each trolleybus in the order provided in the input.

There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
