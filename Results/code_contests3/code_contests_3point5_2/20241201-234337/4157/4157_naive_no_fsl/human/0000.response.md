Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together. The program only considers the maximum time taken by each trolleybus independently, without considering any interactions between them. This violates the problem description, which states that trolleybuses cannot overtake each other and will travel together if one catches up with another.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct arrival times for trolleybuses when they catch up with each other.
