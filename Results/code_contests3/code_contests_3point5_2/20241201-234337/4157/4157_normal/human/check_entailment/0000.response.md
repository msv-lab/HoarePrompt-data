Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program does not handle the case where the trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel the remaining distance together. This results in incorrect arrival times for the trolleybuses. Specifically, the calculation for the time taken by each bus to reach the destination is incorrect when considering scenarios where trolleybuses catch up with each other. The code needs to be modified to account for this situation in order to accurately calculate the arrival times for each trolleybus.
