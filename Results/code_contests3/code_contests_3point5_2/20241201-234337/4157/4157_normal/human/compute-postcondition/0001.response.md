Example Answer:
The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned values by mapping them to integers from the input split by spaces. The previous value of `t` is 0.0 and it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input split.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from the input split**
