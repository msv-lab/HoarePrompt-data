Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `t`. Since no operations are performed on `t` directly in the code snippet, the value of `t` remains the same as the updated maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its current value. The initial state mentions that `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t`, but since `n` is not used in the code snippet, it does not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` retains the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its current value.
Output State: **`t` retains the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its current value**
