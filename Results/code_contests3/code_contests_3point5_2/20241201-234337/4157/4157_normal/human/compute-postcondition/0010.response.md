Example Answer:
`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. Since `t` has been updated to its new maximum value, the condition `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t` is satisfied. The variables `ti` and `v` have float values assigned from the input. The variable `t1` is assigned a calculated float value based on the conditions. 
Output State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value, `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t`; `ti` and `v` have float values assigned from the input, `t1` is assigned a calculated float value based on the conditions**
