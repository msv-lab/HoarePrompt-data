Functionality: ** The function calculates the total time taken by n trolleybuses to travel a distance d based on their individual time and speed values. It iterates through the trolleybuses, calculates the time taken by each bus to reach the destination, and keeps track of the maximum time taken among all buses. The function outputs the maximum time taken. However, the code is missing the import statement for the math module, so it will raise an error when trying to use math.sqrt. Additionally, the code does not handle any input validation or error checking, assuming correct input format and values. **
