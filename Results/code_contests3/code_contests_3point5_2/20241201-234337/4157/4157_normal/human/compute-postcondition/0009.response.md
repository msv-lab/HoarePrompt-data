Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, otherwise `t1` is assigned the value `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The value of `a`, `d`, `v` are float values from the input. The maximum value of `t` has been updated. 
Output State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value, `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input, `t1` is assigned a calculated float value based on the conditions**
