Example Answer:
Since the code snippet only prints the current value of `t`, there are no changes to the variables `t`, `n`, `ti`, `v`, or `t1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has been updated to its new maximum value, `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t`; `ti` and `v` have float values assigned from the input, `t1` is assigned a calculated float value based on the conditions.
Output State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value, `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t`; `ti` and `v` have float values assigned from the input, `t1` is assigned a calculated float value based on the conditions**
