Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. The values of `t1` and `ti` are float values, so the sum will be a float value. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to be the maximum of the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to be the maximum of the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`**
