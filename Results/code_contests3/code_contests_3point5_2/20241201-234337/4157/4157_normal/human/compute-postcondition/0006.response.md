Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. After the update, `t` is printed. The states of `t1` and `ti` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has been updated to its new maximum value.
Output State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value**
