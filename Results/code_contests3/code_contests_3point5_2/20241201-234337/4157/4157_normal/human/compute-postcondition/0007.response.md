According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been updated to its new maximum value. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t`.
State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t**.
