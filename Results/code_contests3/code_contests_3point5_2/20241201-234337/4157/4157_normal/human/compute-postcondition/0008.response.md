Example Answer: 
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values from the input after converting them to float. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`t` has been updated to its new maximum value, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated maximum value of `t; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input.**
