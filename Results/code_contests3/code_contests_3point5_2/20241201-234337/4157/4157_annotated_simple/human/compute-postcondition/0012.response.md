According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated based on the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, and `n` should be greater than the updated value of `i`.
State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` will be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`**
