Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values extracted from the input using `map` and `raw_input().split()`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` should be less than the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` after the next iteration; `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` should be less than the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` after the next iteration; `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
