According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t`, `t1`, `ti`, and `n`. If `t` is less than the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be less than the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` after the next iteration.
State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` should be less than the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` after the next iteration**
