Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `t`. The value of `t` is updated based on the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. Since the initial state of `t` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated based on the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`**
