Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, otherwise it is assigned the value `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The values of `d`, `v`, and `a` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will be: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
