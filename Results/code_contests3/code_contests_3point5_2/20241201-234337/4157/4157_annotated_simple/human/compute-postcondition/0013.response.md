Example Answer: 
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values parsed from the input using `map(float, raw_input().split())`. The loop will execute based on the condition that `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`, and `i` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration. The values of `t` will be updated based on the maximum between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. 
Output State: **`ti` and `v` are assigned input values, loop will execute based on conditions, `t` will be updated based on maximum value between `t1 + ti` and previous `t`**
