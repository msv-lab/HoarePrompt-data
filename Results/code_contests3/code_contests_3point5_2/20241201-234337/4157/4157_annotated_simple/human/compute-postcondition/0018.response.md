The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for calculating the minimum time required for all trolleybuses to reach the final station without violating any speed limits. The function takes into account the number of trolleybuses (n), maximum acceleration (a), distance to the final station (d), departure times of trolleybuses (ti), and maximum speeds of trolleybuses (vi) as preconditions. The function will then return the minimum time required for all trolleybuses to reach the final station while adhering to the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the minimum time required for all trolleybuses to reach the final station without violating any speed limits based on the given preconditions.**
