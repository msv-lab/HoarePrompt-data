Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given constraints of maximum acceleration, maximum speed, and distance. It iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the minimum time it can reach the final station, and prints the result for each trolleybus in the order given in the input.

The program considers the case where trolleybuses catch up with each other and travel together until the final station. It accurately calculates the time for each trolleybus to reach the final station and prints the result with the required precision. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
