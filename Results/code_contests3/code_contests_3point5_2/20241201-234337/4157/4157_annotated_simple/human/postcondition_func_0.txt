The function accepts no parameters explicitly but reads input from the user. It calculates the minimum time required for all trolleybuses to reach the final station without violating any speed limits. The function iterates through the trolleybuses, calculates the travel time for each trolleybus based on its speed and distance, and updates the maximum time needed.
