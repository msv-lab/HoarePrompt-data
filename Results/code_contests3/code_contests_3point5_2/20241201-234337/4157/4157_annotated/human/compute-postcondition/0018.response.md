The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes information about trolleybuses, where each trolleybus has a time ti and a velocity vi. The function calculates and returns the total distance traveled by all trolleybuses, considering their respective velocities and time intervals. The function does not have any input parameters and returns the total distance traveled by the trolleybuses. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the total distance traveled by all trolleybuses based on their velocities and time intervals.**
