Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for the number of trolleybuses `n`, acceleration `a`, and distance to travel `d`. It then iterates over each trolleybus, calculates the total time taken for each trolleybus to reach the destination based on its velocity and acceleration, and updates the maximum time `t`. The function prints the maximum time `t` after each iteration. The functionality does not handle any error cases related to invalid inputs or exceptions that might occur during the calculations. **
