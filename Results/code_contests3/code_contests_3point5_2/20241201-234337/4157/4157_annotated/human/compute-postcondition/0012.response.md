According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` needs to be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **The maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the updated `i`**
