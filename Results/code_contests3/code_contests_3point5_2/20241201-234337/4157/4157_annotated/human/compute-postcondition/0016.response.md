Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `t` directly. The values of `t1`, `ti`, `v`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t1`, `ti`, `v`, `n` and `t` are unchanged. The maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed.
Output State: **`t1`, `ti`, `v`, `n` and `t` are unchanged. The maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed**
