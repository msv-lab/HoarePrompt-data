Example Answer:
The maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t` is assigned to `t`. The values of `t1`, `ti`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the updated `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t1`, `ti`, `v`, `n` and `t` are unchanged. The maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed.
Output State: **`t1`, `ti`, `v`, `n` and `t` are unchanged. The maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t` is printed.**
