Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The values of `t1`, `ti`, and `v` are updated based on their new values. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t1` is updated based on the new values of `v`, `a`, and `d`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` is assigned a new value after converting it to float, `v` is assigned a new value after converting it to float, and `t` is assigned the maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`t1` is updated based on the new values of `v`, `a`, and `d`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ti` is assigned a new value after converting it to float, `v` is assigned a new value after converting it to float, and `t` is assigned the maximum value of `t1 + ti` and `t`**
