Example Answer:
The value of `t` is printed, which is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The value of `t` before the print statement is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`t` is the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
