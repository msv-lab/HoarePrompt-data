Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since the initial state of `t` is not affected by the code snippet, the output state is: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from the input**
