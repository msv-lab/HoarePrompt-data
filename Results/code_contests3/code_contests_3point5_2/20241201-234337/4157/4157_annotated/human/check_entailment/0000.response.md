Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, acceleration, and distance to travel. Then, it iterates over each trolleybus, calculates the total time taken for each trolleybus to reach the destination based on its velocity and acceleration, and updates the maximum time. Finally, it prints the maximum time after each iteration.

The program ensures that trolleybuses do not overtake each other and that they arrive at the final station as quickly as possible. It calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station, taking into account acceleration and deceleration.

Overall, the program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the given input.
