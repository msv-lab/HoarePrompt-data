Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as required by the problem description. The program is using the variables 'b' and 'c' which are not defined in the input. Also, the logic used in the program is incorrect for determining the maximum possible number x. 

For example, if we take the input as "5 2 3", the program will output "0" instead of "1" as the correct answer. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
