Example Answer: 
The code first calculates the value of x as the division result of the maximum and minimum of b and c converted to a float. Then, it computes the expression min(b, c) / float(n) * x and takes the ceiling of that result after converting it to an integer. Finally, it prints that value.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after conversion; `x` is the division result of the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c` converted to a float; the printed value is the ceiling of min(b, c) / float(n) * x converted to an integer**
