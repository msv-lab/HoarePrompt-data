Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values are converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after conversion.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after conversion**
