Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code has a typo where instead of `b` and `c`, it uses `b` and `c` which are not defined.
2. The formula to calculate the maximum possible number of pieces on a plate is incorrect and does not align with the problem description.
3. The code does not handle the case where both cakes have the same number of pieces.

Therefore, the code does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x that satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the problem description.
