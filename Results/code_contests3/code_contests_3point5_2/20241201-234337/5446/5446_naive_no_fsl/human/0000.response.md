Correctness: **False**

For the given program, the logic to determine the maximum possible number x is incorrect. The program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case.

Consider the case where n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3. According to the problem description, the maximum possible number x should be 1. However, the output of the program for this case would be 2, which does not align with the requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
