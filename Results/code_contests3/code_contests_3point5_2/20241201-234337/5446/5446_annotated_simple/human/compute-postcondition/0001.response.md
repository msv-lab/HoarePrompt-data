Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are known integers. Let's say `b` is 10 and `c` is 5, then `x` would be 2.0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input; `x` is 2.0.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from the input; `x` is 2.0**
