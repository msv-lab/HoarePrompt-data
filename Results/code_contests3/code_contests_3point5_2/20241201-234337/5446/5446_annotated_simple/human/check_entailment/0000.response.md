Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as described in the problem. The program calculates x as the maximum of b and c divided by the minimum of b and c, and then tries to calculate the minimum number of pieces on each plate based on this x value. However, this approach does not guarantee that the conditions set in the problem description are met.

For example, if the input is 5 2 3, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2, as it is possible to distribute the cakes such that each plate contains at least 2 pieces of cake.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description and does not provide the correct output for all cases.
