Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`, converted to a float. The values of `b` and `c` are determined by the input received. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received; `x` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received; `x` is the result of the calculation**
