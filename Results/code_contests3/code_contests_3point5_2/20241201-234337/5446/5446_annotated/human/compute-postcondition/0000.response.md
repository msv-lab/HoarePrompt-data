Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input().split()`. The `int(x)` function converts each element of the input split into an integer. The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are determined by the input provided. 
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received.**
