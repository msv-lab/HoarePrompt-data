Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program reads three integers from the user input, calculates a value based on these inputs, and then prints the result after performing mathematical operations. However, the calculations in the program do not align with the requirements of the problem description.

The program calculates `x` as the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum possible number of pieces that can be put on each plate. Additionally, the final calculation to determine the minimum number of pieces on each plate is incorrect and does not follow the conditions specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and it does not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
