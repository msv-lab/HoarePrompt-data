The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. After executing the function body, the program returns the value calculated by taking the cosine of pi divided by 4 times 'n' and dividing it by the sine of pi divided by 2 times 'n', where 'n' is an odd integer between 3 and 199. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer 'n' between 3 and 199 and return a calculated value based on the cosine and sine operations. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an odd integer n between 3 and 199 and returns a calculated value based on cosine and sine operations.**
