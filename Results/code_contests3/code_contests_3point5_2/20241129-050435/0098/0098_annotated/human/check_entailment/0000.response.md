Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 as input. The function then calculates the value by taking the cosine of pi divided by 4 times `n` and dividing it by the sine of pi divided by 2 times `n`, which aligns with the problem description of finding the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded. The program correctly calculates this value and returns it.
