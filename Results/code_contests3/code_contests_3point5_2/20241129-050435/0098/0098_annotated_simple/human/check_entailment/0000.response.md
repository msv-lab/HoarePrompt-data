Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an odd integer `n` as input and calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in based on the given mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions. This matches the requirements of the problem description, which asks for finding the square of the minimum size to embed a 2n-gon for odd integers between 3 and 199.

The program correctly calculates the minimum side length of the square for the given odd integer `n` and returns the result. Hence, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
