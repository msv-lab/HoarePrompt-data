Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199. It calculates the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions based on the value of `n` and returns the result. **

Note: The provided annotated code mentions the input `n` as an odd integer within the specified range, calculates the expression involving cosine and sine functions, and returns the result. It does not cover edge cases where `n` might not be an odd integer or fall outside the given range. The actual code execution might differ if `n` does not meet the specified conditions.
