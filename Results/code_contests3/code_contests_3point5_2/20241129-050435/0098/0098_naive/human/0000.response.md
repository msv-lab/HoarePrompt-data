Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates and prints the minimum length of a side of the square that the 2n-gon can be embedded in. The formula used to calculate the side length of the square is mathematically correct and is applicable to all odd integer values of n within the given range. The program also handles multiple test cases as per the problem description. Since the formula used is derived from geometric principles, there are no specific cases where the program would fail to produce the correct output.
