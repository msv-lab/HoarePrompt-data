#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.**
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of the expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) where n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and returns the value of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` based on the input `n`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is an even number or falls outside the specified range.
