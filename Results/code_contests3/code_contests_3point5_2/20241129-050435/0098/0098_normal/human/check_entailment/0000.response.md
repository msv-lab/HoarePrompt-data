Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is only defined for odd integers within the range of 3 to 199. However, the code does not handle cases where `n` is an even number or falls outside the specified range. This means that the code will not provide correct output for all possible test cases.
