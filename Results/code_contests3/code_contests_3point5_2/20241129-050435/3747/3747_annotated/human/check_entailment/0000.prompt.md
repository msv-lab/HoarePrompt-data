You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is a_i. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4].

Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of coins.

The second line of the input contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — values of coins.

Output

Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. The list a contains n integers such that each element ai is an integer and 1 <= ai <= 100.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    if (n == 11) :
        print(5)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list containing `n` integers where each `a[i]` is an integer between 1 and 100. If `n` is equal to 11, the value of `n` is updated to 11 and the number 5 is printed.
    c = [0] * 101
    for d in a:
        c[d] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty list containing `n` integers between 1 and 100, `c` is a list containing 101 integers where each element represents the frequency of the corresponding integer in list `a`.
    print(max(c))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Then, it creates a frequency count list `c` for the elements in `a` and prints the maximum frequency. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and operates based on user input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
