Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. It does not distribute the coins between pockets such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket. Instead, it simply prints the maximum frequency of any coin value in the input list `a`. 

The program only prints 5 if the input integer `n` is equal to 11, which is unrelated to the problem description. Furthermore, it does not actually distribute the coins between pockets as required by the problem.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
