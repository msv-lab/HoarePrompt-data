Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` contains `n` integers with each element `a[i]` being an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, list `a` contains `n` integers such that each `a[i]` is an integer between 1 and 100.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, list `a` contains `n` integers such that each `a[i]` is an integer between 1 and 100**
