Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` corresponds to the next element in list `a`, so the element at index `d` in list `c` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty list containing `n` integers between 1 and 100 with at least one more element to iterate over, `c` is a list containing 101 integers where the element at index `d` (the next element in list `a`) is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty list containing `n` integers between 1 and 100 with at least one more element to iterate over, `c` is a list containing 101 integers where the element at index `d` (the next element in list `a`) is incremented by 1**
