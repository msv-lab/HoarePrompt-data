Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Since `d` is the next element in the list `a`, which contains `n` integers, the value of `d` can be any integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty list containing `n` integers between 1 and 100 with at least one more element to iterate over, `c` is a list containing 101 integers where the element at index `d` (the next element in list `a`) is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a non-empty list containing `n` integers between 1 and 100 with at least one more element to iterate over, `c` is a list containing 101 integers where the element at index `d` (the next element in list `a`) is incremented by 1**
