Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code simply calculates the frequency of each integer in the list and prints the maximum frequency among all integers in the list. This does not align with the requirement of distributing the coins between pockets such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket. 

For example, if we take the input [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2], the code would output 2 which represents the frequency of the most common coin value (in this case, 2 and 3). However, the correct output should be 3 as we can distribute the coins as [1, 2, 4] and [2, 3, 3].

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
