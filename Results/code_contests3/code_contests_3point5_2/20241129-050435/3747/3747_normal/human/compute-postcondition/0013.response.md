Example Answer:
The `max(c)` function returns the maximum value in the list `c`. Each integer in list `a` has its count increased by 1 in the list `c`. Therefore, the maximum value in list `c` would be the count of the most frequent integer in list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, each integer in `a` has its count increased by 1 in the list `c`, the maximum value in list `c` is printed**
