According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `a` is not empty. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the loop can execute if `a` has at least one integer. 

To adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty. Additionally, we need to set `d` to be the first integer in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `d` is the first integer in `a`**
