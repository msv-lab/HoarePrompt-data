According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are still elements left in the list, the loop will execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `d` is the first integer in `a`, and the count of the first integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`. To execute the loop one more time, the list `a` must still have elements left, and the next integer in the list becomes the new `d`.
State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, next integer in `a` becomes the new `d`, and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`**
