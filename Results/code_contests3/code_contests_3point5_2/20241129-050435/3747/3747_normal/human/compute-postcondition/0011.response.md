Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the next integer in the list `a`, and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, next integer in `a` becomes the new `d`, and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, next integer in `a` becomes the new `d`, and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`**
