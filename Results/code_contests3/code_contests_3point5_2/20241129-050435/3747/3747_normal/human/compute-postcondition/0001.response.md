Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping each element of the input split by space to an integer. The input is provided by the user and the values of `a_i` are integers between 1 and 100. Therefore, after execution, `a` will contain a list of integers corresponding to the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
