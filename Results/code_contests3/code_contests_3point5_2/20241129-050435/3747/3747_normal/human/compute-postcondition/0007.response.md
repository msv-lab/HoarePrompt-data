Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the first integer in the list `a`, which is a non-empty list obtained from the input. The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `d` is the first integer in `a`, and the count of the first integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, `d` is the first integer in `a`, and the count of the first integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`**
