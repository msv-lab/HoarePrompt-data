Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now determined by user input. The values of `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer greater than 0, and a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n.
Output State: **n is an input integer greater than 0, and a_i are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n**
