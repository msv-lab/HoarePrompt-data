According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, and the next integer in `a` becomes the new `d`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next integer in `a` becomes the new `d` and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a_i` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for 1 <= i <= n, `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input, next integer in `a` becomes the new `d`, and the count of this integer in `a` is increased by 1 in the list `c`**
