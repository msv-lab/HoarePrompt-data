Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It seems to be hardcoding the output for a specific case (n == 11) instead of actually finding the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. Additionally, it is not handling the case where two coins with the same value cannot be put into the same pocket. 

Example:
Input
6
1 2 3 4 5 6

Output
1

In this case, the program should output 6 as each coin has a different value and cannot be put into the same pocket. However, the program incorrectly outputs 1.
