According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Before the loop starts, the state of `n` and `a` is already defined. However, the state of `d` is not specified before the loop starts. In order for the loop to execute, the element `d` should be equal to the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `d` is equal to the first element in list `a`**
