According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are still elements in the list `a` that have not been iterated over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros, and `d` is equal to the last element that was iterated over in list `a`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `d` needs to be set to the next element in list `a` that has not been iterated over, and the element at index `d` in list `c` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros, for the loop to execute one more time `d` needs to be equal to the next element in list `a` that has not been iterated over, the element at index `d` in list `c` should be incremented by 1**
