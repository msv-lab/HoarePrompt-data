According to the code, the loop will iterate over the elements in list `a`. To execute one more time, the next element in list `a` that has not been iterated over should be selected as `d`, and the element at index `d` in list `c` should be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros. To execute one more time, `d` needs to be equal to the next element in list `a` that has not been iterated over, and the element at index `d` in list `c` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values to integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros, for the loop to execute one more time `d` needs to be equal to the next element in list `a` that has not been iterated over, the element at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1**
