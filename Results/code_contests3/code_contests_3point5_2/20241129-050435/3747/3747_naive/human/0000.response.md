Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly determines the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute the coins such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket. It first reads the input values, then counts the occurrences of each coin value using a list c. Finally, it prints the maximum count of any coin value in c, which represents the minimum number of pockets needed. The program handles all potential cases as it correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description.
