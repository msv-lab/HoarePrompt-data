Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The program only considers the last digit of the input number and does not handle the case where the digit to be subtracted is not the last digit. For example, if the input is 29, the program would output 3 (29 -> 20 -> 18 -> 9 -> 0) instead of the correct answer which is 5 (29 -> 20 -> 18 -> 10 -> 9 -> 0). 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
