Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

For example, if the input is 24, the program would output 6 instead of the expected output of 5. The correct sequence of subtractions should be 24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0, which requires 5 subtractions. 

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description, making it incorrect.
