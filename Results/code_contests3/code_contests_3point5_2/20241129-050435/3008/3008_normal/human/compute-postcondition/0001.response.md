Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. Since the initial state is that `n` is a non-negative integer inputted by the user, the value of `n` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer inputted by the user, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer inputted by the user, `s` is 0**
