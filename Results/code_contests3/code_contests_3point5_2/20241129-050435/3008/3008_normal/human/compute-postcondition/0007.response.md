Functionality: **The function prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n`, checks if the last digit of `n` is not 0, updates `s` to 1 in that case, and then prints the result of the mathematical expression 2 * (n / 10) + s. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output.** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle cases where the input is not a valid non-negative integer.
- The code does not account for potential errors that could arise during the input process.
