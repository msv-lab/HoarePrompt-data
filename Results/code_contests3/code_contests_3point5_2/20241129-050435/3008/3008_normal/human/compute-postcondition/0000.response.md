Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input()` accepts an input. The value of `n` is now whatever the user inputted, which could be any non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer inputted by the user.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer inputted by the user**
