Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code only considers the last digit of the input `n` and calculates the number of subtractions accordingly. However, this approach is incorrect as it does not take into account all possible digits that can be subtracted from `n`. For example, if `n = 24`, the code will output `5`, but the correct answer should be `6` as the optimal sequence of subtractions is: 24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0. 

Therefore, the code does not handle all potential cases and is not correct according to the problem description.
