Postcondition: ***n is at least 0, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, p contains n+1 tuples of (fi, ti) sorted in descending order based on the first element, time_passed is updated n+2 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0], s is updated to p[i][0] for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time n should be equal to or greater than 0. If time_passed < p[i][1], then the loop continues with the next iteration.***
