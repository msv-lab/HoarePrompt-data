Postcondition: ***n is at least 0, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, p contains n+1 tuples of (fi, ti) sorted in descending order based on the first element, time_passed is updated n+1 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0], s is updated to p[i][0]. In addition, time_passed is less than p[i][1] based on the condition***
