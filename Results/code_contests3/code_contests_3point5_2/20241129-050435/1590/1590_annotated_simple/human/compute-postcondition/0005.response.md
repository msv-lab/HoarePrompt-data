According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time**
