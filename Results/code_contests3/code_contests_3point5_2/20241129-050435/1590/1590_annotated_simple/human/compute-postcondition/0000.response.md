Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `n` and `s` are constrained to be integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000**
