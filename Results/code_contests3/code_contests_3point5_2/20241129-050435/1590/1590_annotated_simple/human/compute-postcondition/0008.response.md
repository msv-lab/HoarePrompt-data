According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains the updated tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers.
So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain within the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains the updated tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
