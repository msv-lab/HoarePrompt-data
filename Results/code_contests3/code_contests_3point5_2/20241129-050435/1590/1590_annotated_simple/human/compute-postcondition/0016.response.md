Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `p`. Since `p` contains `n+1` tuples and is sorted in descending order, and the loop executes `n+1` times, the value of `time_passed` will be updated `n+1` times accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 0, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples of `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element, `time_passed` is updated `n+1` times based on the formula `time_passed += s - p[i][0]`**
