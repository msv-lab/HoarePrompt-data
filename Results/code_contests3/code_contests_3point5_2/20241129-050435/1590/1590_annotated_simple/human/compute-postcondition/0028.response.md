Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `p[i][0]`, and `p[i][0]` is updated to `p[i+1][0]`. The value of `time_passed` is updated `n+3` times based on the formula `time_passed += s - p[i][0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is at least 0, s is updated to p[i+1][0], time_passed is updated n+3 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0].
Output State: **n is at least 0, s is updated to p[i+1][0], time_passed is updated n+3 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0]**
