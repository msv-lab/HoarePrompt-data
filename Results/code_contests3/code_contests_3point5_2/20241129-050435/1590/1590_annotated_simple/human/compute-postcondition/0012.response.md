Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The previous values of `p` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n` tuples of `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n` tuples of `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element**
