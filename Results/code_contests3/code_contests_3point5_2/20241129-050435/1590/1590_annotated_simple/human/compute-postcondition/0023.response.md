Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` of list `p`. The previous state of `i` is unknown, and it depends on the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: n is at least 0, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, p contains n+1 tuples of (fi, ti) sorted in descending order based on the first element, time_passed is updated n+2 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0], s is updated to p[i][0] for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time n should be equal to or greater than 0.
Output State: **n is at least 0, s is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, p contains n+1 tuples of (fi, ti) sorted in descending order based on the first element, time_passed is updated n+2 times based on the formula time_passed += s - p[i][0], s is updated to p[i][0] for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time n should be equal to or greater than 0**
