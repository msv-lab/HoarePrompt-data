Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated n+3 times based on the formula `time_passed += s - p[i][0]`. Then, `time_passed` is updated again based on the formula `time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed`. The previous values of variables `n`, `s`, and `p` are unknown, so the final value of `time_passed` cannot be determined accurately.
Output State: **Unable to determine the final value of time_passed accurately.**
