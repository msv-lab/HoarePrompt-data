Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. Since `p` originally contained `n` tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element, after appending `(0, 0)`, the list `p` now contains `n+1` tuples where the new tuple `(0, 0)` is at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples of `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples of `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element**
