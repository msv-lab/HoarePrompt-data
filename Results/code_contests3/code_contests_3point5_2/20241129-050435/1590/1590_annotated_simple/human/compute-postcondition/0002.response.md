According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list, so the loop will execute. To ensure the loop executes the first time, `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
