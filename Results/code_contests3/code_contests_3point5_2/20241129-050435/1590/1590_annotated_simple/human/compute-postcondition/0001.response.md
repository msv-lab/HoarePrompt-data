Example Answer:
The list `p` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `s` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list**
