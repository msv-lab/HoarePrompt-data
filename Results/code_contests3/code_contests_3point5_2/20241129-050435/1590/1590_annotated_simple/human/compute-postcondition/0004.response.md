Example Answer:
`(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`, where `fi` and `ti` are the first and second integer values from the input, respectively. The initial state variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
