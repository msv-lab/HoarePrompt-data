Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is the first element of the tuple (0, 0) in p, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple with a tuple (0, 0) appended to `p`, `time_passed` is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the first position of tuples in `p`, `i` is the last index of the loop, which is n. If time_passed is less than p[i][1], the program will remain in the current state.**
