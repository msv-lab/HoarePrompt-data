Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters. It reads input data about passengers arriving at a building, calculates the time passed for each passenger based on the floor they arrived at and the time of arrival, and prints the total time passed. However, the current implementation does not accurately calculate the time passed for each passenger due to a logic error in the calculation. The code should be adjusted to correctly calculate the time passed for each passenger. **
