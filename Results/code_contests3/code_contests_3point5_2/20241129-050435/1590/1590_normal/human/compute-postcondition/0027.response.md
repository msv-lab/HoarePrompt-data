Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the (i+1)-th tuple in `p`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `time_passed` depends on the values of `s` and `p[2][0]`. No other variables are affected by this calculation. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is the first element of the (i+1)-th tuple in `p`, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple with a tuple (0, 0) appended to `p`, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the (i+1)-th tuple in `p`, `i` is 2.**
