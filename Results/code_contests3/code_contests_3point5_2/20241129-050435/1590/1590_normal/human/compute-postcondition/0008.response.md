According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute another time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2 and `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute another time**
