According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute another time**
