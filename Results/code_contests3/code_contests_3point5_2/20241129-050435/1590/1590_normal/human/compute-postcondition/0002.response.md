According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list which does not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
