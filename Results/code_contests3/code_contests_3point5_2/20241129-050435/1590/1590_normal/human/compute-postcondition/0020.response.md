Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, s is the first element of the i-th tuple in p, p is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple with a tuple (0, 0) appended to p, time_passed is increased by the difference between s and the first element of the i-th tuple in p, i is 0. If time_passed < p[i][1], the function continues.***
