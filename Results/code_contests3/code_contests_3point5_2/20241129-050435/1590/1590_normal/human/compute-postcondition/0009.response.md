Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values extracted by mapping the integers from the input split by whitespace. The range of values for `fi` and `ti` are not specified, but they are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute another time**
