Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. Since the inputs are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
