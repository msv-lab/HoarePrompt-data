Example Answer: 
A tuple (fi, ti) is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from the input after splitting. The previous values of `p` are not provided, so the output state is: 
`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute another time, and `fi`, `ti` are assigned the values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute another time, and `fi`, `ti` are assigned the values from the input after splitting**
