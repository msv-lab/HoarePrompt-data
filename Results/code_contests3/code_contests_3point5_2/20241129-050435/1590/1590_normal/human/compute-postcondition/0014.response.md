Example Answer: 
`time_passed` is assigned the value 0. Since this assignment does not affect the values of other variables, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, and a tuple (0, 0) is appended to `p`, `time_passed` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, and a tuple (0, 0) is appended to `p`, `time_passed` is 0**
