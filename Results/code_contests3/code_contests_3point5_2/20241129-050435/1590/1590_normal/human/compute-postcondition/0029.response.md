The value of `time_passed` is increased by the difference between the second element of the tuple at index `i` of `p` and the current value of `time_passed`. Since the initial value of `i` is 2, the tuple at index `i` is the third tuple in `p`. Therefore, `time_passed` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is the first element of the (i+1)-th tuple in `p`, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple with a tuple (0, 0) appended to `p`, `time_passed` is increased by the difference between `s` and the first element of the (i+1)-th tuple in `p`, `i` is 2.**
