Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately calculate the time passed for each passenger. The logic error in the calculation results in incorrect output. 

For example, if we take the input:
3 7
2 1
3 8
5 2

The expected output should be 11 seconds, but the code will output a different value due to the incorrect logic in calculating the time passed for each passenger.
