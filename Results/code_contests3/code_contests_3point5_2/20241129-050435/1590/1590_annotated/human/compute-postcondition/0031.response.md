Output State: **`p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end and sorted in descending order, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is equal to the total number of iterations, `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between each `p[i][1]` and `p[i][0]`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then the program continues.**
