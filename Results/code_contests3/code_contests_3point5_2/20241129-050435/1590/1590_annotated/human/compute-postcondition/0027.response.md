The code snippet calculates the difference between the current value of `s` and `p[i][0]` and adds it to `time_passed`.

Output State: **`p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end and sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[2][1] - (s - p[2][0])`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[2][0]`**
