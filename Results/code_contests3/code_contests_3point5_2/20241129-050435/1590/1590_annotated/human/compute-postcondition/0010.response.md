Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the tuple `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown, and `p` now contains the updated tuple with the new values. The value of `i` remains 2, and the value of `n` is still unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `n` remains unknown.
Output State: **`p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `n` remains unknown**
