Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated by subtracting the previous value of `time_passed` from `p[i][1]`. Since `time_passed` is already updated by `s - p[1][0]`, the new value of `time_passed` will be `p[i][1] - (s - p[1][0])`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end and sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `time_passed` is updated by `p[i][1] - (s - p[1][0])`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[i][0]`, and the program continues.
