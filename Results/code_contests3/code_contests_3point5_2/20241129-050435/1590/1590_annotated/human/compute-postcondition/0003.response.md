Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input is taken and split into two integers, which are then assigned to `fi` and `ti`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input.
Output State: **`p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input**
