Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input, and the loop executes the first time when `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
