Output State: **`p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end and sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[1][0]`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[i][0]`, and the program continues**
