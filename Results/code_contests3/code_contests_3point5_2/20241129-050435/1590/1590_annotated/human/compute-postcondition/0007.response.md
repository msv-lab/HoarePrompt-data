Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the tuple `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown, but the tuple `p` now contains an additional tuple. The value of `n` remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `n` remains unknown.
Output State: **`p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `n` remains unknown**
