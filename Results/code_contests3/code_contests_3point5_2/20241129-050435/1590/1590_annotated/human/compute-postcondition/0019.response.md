Output State: `p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `p` is still sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `s` and the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `p`. `s` is updated to the first element of the `i-th` tuple in `p`. Moreover, the `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`.
