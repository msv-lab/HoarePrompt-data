Output State: **`p` now contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end. `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `p` is still sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order.**
