According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2 and `n` remains unknown.
State: **`p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `n` remains unknown**
