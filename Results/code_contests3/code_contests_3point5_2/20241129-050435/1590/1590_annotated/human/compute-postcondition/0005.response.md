According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`p` contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1**
