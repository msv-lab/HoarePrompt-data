Example Answer:
The variable `time_passed` is assigned the value 0, which means that the time passed in the program is now 0. The states of the other variables `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations, `p` is still sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, and `time_passed` is 0.
Output State: **`p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is the total number of iterations, `p` is still sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `time_passed` is 0**
