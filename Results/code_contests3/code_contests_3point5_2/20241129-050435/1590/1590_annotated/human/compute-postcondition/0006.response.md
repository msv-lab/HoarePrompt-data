Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by the input provided. The loop does not depend on these values, but `p` is updated to contain the new values of `(fi, ti)`. The value of `n` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so it remains unknown.
Output State: **`p` contains a tuple with new values of `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `n` remains unknown**
