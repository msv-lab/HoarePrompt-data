Postcondition: ***`p` contains a list of tuples with values `(fi, ti)` for each iteration of the loop with an additional tuple `(0, 0)` appended at the end and sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[2][1] - (s - p[2][0])`, `s` is updated to the value of `p[2][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then the state of the program remains the same.***
