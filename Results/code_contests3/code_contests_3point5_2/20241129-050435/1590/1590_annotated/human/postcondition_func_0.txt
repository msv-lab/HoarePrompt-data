The function `func` reads input values `n` and `s`, then proceeds to read `n` pairs of integers `(fi, ti)` and stores them in a list `p`. It sorts the list `p` based on the first element of the tuple in descending order, then calculates `time_passed` by summing differences between elements of `p`. It updates `s` and checks if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, adjusting `time_passed` accordingly. Finally, it prints the calculated `time_passed`. The function does not have explicit return values and operates solely based on the input constraints and calculations.
