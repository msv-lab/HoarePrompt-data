Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the conditions for creating Bingo cards as described in the problem statement. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created for a given input of N, M, and S. The program iterates through all possible combinations and computes the number of valid Bingo cards. Finally, it outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000. The logic and implementation seem to be correct, and there are no apparent cases where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
