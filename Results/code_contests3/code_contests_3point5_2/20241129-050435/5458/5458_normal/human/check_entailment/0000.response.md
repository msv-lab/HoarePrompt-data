Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions. It follows the problem description by initializing a 3D array `dp` and updating it based on certain conditions.
- The code handles multiple datasets, reads input values until they are all 0, and performs the necessary calculations to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created.
- The output is the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000, as required.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the code would not meet the given conditions.
