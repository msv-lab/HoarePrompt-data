The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined positive integer variables N, M, and S, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function reads input values for n, m, and s until all three are 0. It then performs a complex calculation using dynamic programming to update a 3D array `dp`. The final result is printed based on specific indices of the `dp` array. The function does not have a specific return value specified, as the output is dependent on the operations performed within the function body. The loop continues until n, m, and s are all 0.
