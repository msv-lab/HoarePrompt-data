According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the final values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `dp` cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, for the loop to execute, it needs to be adjusted so that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, and `s` is at least 1.
State: **for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1**
