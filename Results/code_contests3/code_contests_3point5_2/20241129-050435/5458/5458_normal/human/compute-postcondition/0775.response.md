Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod.***
