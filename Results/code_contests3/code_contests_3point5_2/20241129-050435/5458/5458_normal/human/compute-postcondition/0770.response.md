Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. Since the calculation is based on the previous values of the variables and no specific values are provided, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
