According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `m` should be 0, `s` should be 0, and `i` should be 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
