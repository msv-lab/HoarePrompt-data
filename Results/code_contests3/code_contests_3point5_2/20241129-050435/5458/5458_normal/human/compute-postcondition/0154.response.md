Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `mod` are not directly affected by this operation. After execution, `j` becomes greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0.
