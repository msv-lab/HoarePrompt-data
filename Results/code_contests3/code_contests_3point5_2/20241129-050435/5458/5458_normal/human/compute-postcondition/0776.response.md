According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. Since `k` is increased by 1 in each iteration, it should be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be adjusted such that it is less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**
