Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer, `i` is either 0 (incremented by 1 and set to 1) or not 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`.***
