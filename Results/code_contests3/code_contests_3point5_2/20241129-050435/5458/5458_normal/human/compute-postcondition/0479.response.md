Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the loop will execute again, and `k` will be incremented by 1 as specified in the initial state. The value of `s` remains the same. 
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again; `k` is incremented by 1**
