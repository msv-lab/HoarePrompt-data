Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues without any changes to the state of the variables.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m`. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues without any changes to the state of the variables.**
