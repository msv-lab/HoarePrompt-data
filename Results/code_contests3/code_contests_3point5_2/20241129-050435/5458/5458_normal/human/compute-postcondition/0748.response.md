Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop continues and the values of `m`, `n`, `s`, and `k` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, the loop terminates without any changes.***
