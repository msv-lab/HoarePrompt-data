Postcondition: ***1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] plus the modulo operation result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j].***
