Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues the loop execution based on the given conditions.***
