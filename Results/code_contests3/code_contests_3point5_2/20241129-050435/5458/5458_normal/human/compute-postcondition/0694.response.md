According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` is an integer, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. for the loop to execute another time `j` should be less than `m`**
