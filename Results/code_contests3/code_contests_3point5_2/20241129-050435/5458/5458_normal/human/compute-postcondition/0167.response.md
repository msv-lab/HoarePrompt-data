Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive), and the conditions for updating `dp` are met. If `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
