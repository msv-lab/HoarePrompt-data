Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The modulo operation is performed on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` remains equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][s + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain the same as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` remains equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][s + 1]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` remains equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][s + 1]**.
