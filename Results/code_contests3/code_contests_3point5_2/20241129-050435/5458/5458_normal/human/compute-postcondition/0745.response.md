Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
