According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m+1`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive)**
