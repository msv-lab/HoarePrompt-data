Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. The array `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is also an integer. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, in the else part, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s]` are updated based on the given code snippet.***
