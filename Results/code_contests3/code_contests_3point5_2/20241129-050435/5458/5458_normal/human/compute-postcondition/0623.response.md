Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The previous value of `dp[n]` is not mentioned, so it remains unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are input integers**
