Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, `k` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `S`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the mentioned assignments are carried out.***
