Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, S is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions and assignments within the loop, i is incremented by 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time m is greater than 0. Additionally, i is not equal to 0. In addition, j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
