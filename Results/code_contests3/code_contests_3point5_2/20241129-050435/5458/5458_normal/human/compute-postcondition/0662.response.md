According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. `j` must be less than `m + 1` for the loop to execute again. Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j is incremented by 1`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are integers. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j is incremented by 1`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers, `j` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1**
