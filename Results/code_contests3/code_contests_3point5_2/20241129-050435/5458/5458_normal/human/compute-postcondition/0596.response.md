Postcondition: ***At the end of all iterations, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer value, `i` can be any integer value, and `k` must be in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. The condition (i == 0) is false. Also, `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
