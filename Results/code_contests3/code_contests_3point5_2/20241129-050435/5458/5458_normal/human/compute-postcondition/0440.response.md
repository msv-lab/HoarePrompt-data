Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and either `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 or if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and either `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 or if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
