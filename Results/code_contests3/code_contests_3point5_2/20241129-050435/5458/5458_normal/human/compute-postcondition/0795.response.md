According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, and the final value of `k` is `s` + 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, the final value of `k` is `s` + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
