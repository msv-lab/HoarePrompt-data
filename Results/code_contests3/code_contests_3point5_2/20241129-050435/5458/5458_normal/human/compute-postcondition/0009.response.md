According to the code, the loop will execute from 1 to S inclusive. So, for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `k` should be 1. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values with dimensions determined by the values of `M` and `S`, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
