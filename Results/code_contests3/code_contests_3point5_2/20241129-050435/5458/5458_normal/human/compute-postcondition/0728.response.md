According to the code, the loop will execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined. However, since the loop is iterating `n^2` times, to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n^2 - 1`.

State: **The final values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n^2 - 1`**
