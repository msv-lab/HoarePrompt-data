Postcondition: ***N, M, S, Mod, DP, i, j, and k are updated based on the loop conditions and assignments. The value of k is now one more than the previous value for the loop to execute one more time. If i == 0, then if j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo operation of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, otherwise dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
