Output State: **At the end of all iterations, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. The values of the variables depend on the conditions specified in the loop body. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i == 0`, `j > k`, and `k` is not equal to `s`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `i != 0`, `j > k`, and `k` is not equal to `s`, `dp` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
