Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1**
