According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` will remain unchanged, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be incremented by 1. 

State: **`s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be incremented by 1**
