Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial state tells us that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `s` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: *1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k*.
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**.
