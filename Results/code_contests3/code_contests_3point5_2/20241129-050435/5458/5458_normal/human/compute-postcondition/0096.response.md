Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions and assignments within the loop, `i`, `j` is updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program state remains the same.***
