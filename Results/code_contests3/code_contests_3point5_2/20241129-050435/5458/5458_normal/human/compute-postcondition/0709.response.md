Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1 if they are within the ranges specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers**
