Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement bypasses the rest of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1**
