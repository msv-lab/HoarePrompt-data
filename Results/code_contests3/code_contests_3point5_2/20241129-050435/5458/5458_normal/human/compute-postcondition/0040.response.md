Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the conditions of the loop.**
