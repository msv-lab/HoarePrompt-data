Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
