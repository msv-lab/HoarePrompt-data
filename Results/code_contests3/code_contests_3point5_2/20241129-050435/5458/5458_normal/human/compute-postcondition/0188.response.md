Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m+1`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive). If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is applied to update the values in the `dp` list.***
