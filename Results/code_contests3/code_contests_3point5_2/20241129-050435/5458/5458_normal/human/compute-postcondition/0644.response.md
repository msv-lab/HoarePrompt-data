Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` are all integers. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
