According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, inclusive. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the loop, `m`, `n`, `s`, and `j` are increased by 1, and `k` becomes `s` + 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m`, `n`, `s`, and `j` are all increased by 1, and `k` is equal to `s`. 

State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are all increased by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`**
