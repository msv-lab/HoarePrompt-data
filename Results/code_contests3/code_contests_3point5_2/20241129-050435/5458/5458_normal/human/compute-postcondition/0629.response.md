According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `s` is initially 0, it needs to be adjusted to `s` is now at least 1. Additionally, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `k` should be 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1, `k` is 1**
