Example Answer: 
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `n`, `m`, and `mod` remain unchanged. As per the initial state, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, and the loop executes when `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1. Since `j` is not mentioned in the code snippet, it remains the same as initialized. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is not 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` is 1, `j` and `m` are appropriately initialized, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`i` is not 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` is 1, `j` and `m` are appropriately initialized, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated**
