According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start, `m` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop index `j` starts from 1, so it should be adjusted to 1 as well.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 1, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
