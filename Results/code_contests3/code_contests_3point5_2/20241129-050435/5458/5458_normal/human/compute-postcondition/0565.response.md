Output State: **`s`, `j`, and `i` remain integers. `k` is incremented by 1. If `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is set to 1. The condition `i == 0` is false. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
