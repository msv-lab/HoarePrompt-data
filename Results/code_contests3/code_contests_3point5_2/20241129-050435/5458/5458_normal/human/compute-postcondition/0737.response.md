Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables and values are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but based on the given constraints, we can infer that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: *`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
