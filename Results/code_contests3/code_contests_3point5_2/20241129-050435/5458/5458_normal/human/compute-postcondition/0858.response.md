Postcondition: ***`k` is adjusted to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is adjusted to the current value plus 1, `j` is adjusted to the current value plus 1. If `j` > `k`, then if `i` == 0 and `j` >= `k`, `k` is set to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
