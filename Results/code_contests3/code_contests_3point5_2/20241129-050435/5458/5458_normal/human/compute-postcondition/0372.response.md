Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
