According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and the range of `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. 

So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time**
