According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If m is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the final values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n^2 - 1`. 
State: **Final values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`**
