Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations described in the else part of the code.***
