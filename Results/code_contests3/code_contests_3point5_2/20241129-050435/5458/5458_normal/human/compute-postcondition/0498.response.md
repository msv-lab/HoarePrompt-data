Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m` + 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod as the loop continues with updated values of `j` and `k`.***
