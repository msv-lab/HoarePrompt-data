Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, j is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to M, i is updated to 1, k remains the same, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values where dp[1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
