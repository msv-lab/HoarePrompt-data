Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the value of `i` is not given, the state of `j` and `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is updated accordingly for the loop to execute another time if `i` is 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is updated accordingly for the loop to execute another time if `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
