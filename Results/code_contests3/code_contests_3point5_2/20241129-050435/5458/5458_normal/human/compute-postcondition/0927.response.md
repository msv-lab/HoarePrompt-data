Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` remain unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions provided. `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. After the execution of the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
