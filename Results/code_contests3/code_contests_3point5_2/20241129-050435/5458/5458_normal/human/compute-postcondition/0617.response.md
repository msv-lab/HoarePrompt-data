Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `dp` array has been updated according to the conditions specified. After the execution of the if else block, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` will be updated to 1 if `j >= k`. Additionally, the iteration of the loop will be skipped if `j > k`.***
