Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are fixed in the initial state, the new value is stored in `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
