According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute for another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `1 ≤ M ≤ 2000`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2. Since the loop increases `k` by 1 each time, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 3.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
