Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are still incremented by 1. `j` is still less than `m + 1`. The loop continues as `s` is at least 1. `i` is still not equal to 0. The value of `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
