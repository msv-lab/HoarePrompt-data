Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions and assignments within the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to or greater than `k`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
