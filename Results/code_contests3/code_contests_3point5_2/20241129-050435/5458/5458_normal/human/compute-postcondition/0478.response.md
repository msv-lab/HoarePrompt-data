Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` is incremented by 1**
