Postcondition: ***`k`, `i`, `j` are adjusted values. If `j` >= `k`, `k` is set to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `i` == 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `k` is set to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, `k` is adjusted to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is adjusted to the current value plus 1, `j` is adjusted to the current value plus 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
