Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The bitwise AND operation is performed on `i + 1` and `1`, and `j` is incremented by 1. The loop executes when `s` is at least 1 and `k` is less than `s`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` is an integer, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is an integer, `j + 1` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `k` is less than `s`**
