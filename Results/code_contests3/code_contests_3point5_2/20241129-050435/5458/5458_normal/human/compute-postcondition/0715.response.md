Example Answer:
The value of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k]` is unknown, and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is not calculable. 
Output State: **Not enough information to determine output state**
