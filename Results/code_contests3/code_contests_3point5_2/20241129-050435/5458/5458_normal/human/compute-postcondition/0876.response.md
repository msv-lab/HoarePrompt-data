Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `mod` are integers. If `j >= k`, `i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
