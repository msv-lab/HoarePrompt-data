Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. Mod is assigned the value 100000. DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments. i is incremented by 1, k is 2, m is greater than 0 for the loop to execute another time. The new value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
