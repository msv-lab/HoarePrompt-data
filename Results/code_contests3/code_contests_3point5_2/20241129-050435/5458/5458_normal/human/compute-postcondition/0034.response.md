Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts, `k` is 3.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts, `k` is 3**
