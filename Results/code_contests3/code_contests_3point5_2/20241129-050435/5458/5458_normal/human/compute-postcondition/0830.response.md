For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, The final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are not accurately determinable**
