Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Other variables remain the same unless `j` is greater than `k`, in which case the program state remains unchanged. 
Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i`, `j` is updated to the next value, `k` is updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `s` + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program state remains the same.**
