Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned as 1. The values of i, j, and k are given in the initial state. After this operation, the updated state will have changes in the dp array based on the new values of i, j, and k. 
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, dp has been updated with the new value assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] as 1.**
