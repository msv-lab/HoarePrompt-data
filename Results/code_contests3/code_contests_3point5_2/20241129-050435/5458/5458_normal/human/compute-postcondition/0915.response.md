Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` remain unchanged. If `j` > `k`, then the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts. Specifically, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`. Additionally, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
