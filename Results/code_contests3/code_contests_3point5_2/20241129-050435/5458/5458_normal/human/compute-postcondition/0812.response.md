Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all increased by 1, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all increased by 1, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
