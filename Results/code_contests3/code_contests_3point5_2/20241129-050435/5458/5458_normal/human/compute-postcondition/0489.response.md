Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m` + 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is equal to 0. When the if condition (j >= k) is met, the program variables are in a state where j is greater than or equal to k. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
