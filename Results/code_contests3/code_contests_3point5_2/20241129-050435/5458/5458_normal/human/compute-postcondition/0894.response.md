Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `k+1`, `n`, `m`, `mod` are integers. If `j >= k+1`, `i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is set to 1. If `j > k+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][(k+1)] % mod`. In addition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `k` is incremented by 1.***
