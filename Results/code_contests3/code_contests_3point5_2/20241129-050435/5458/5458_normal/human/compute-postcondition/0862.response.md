Output State: **`i`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `mod` are integers. If the loop executes, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is determinable for all iterations. The values at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are based on the conditions within the loop. If the loop does not execute, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined.**
