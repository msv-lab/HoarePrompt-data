Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known integers, and `mod` is assumed to be a constant. The program state remains unchanged after the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers. The loop may execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. The program state remains unchanged after the execution of the if else block.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers. The loop may execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. The program state remains unchanged after the execution of the if else block.**
