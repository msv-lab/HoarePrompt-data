Postcondition: ***`s`, `k`, `i`, `m` are integers increased by 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, `j`, `i` are set to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` is set to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
