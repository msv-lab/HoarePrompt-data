According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k + 1` is an integer, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
