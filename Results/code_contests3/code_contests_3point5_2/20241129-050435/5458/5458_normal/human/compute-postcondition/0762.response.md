According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined. The loop will update the values of `dp` based on the conditions provided in the loop code. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is increased by 1, the final values of `k` and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined**
