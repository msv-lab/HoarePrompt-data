According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is increased by 1, and the final values of `k` and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` cannot be accurately determined. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `s` is greater than 0, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are all increased by 1, and `k` is now 1.

State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
