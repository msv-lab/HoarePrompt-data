Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
