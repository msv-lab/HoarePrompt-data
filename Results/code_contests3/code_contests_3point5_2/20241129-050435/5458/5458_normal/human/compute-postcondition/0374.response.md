According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2**
