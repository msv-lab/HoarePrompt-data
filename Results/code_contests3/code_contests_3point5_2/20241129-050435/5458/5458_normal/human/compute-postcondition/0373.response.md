Postcondition: ***1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
