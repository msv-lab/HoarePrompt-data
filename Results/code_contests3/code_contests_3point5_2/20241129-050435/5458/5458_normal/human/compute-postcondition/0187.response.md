Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m+1`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive), `i` is not equal to 0. The formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is applied where the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are used to update the values in the `dp` list.**
