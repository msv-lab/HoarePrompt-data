According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `dp`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, `j` must be less than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated accordingly.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s, `j` must be less than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated.**
