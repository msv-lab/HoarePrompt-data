Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive). The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the loop conditions as described in the loop code.**
