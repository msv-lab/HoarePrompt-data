Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables but simply continues to the next iteration in the loop or the next statement outside the loop. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers**
