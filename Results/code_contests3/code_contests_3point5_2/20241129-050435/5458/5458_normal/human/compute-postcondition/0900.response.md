Output State: `i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` and `m` are appropriately initialized, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
