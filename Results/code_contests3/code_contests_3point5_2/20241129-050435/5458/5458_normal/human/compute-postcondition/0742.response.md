Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 after the execution of the if else block. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or program execution.***
