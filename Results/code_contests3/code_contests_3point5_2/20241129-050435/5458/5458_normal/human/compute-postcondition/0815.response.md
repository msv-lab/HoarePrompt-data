Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2` and if `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The initial states of all variables are `m + 1`, `n + 1`, `s + 1`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`. 
Output State: **`m` is increased by 1, `n` is increased by 1, `s` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1**.
