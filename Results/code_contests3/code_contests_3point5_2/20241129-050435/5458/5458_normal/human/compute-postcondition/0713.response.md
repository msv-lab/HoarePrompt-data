Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the loop to execute another time, `j` should be less than `m`, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.***
