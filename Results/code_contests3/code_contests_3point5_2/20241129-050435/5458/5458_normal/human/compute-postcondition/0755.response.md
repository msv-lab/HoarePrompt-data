Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not explicitly provided in the initial state, so their values remain unknown. The only explicit information is that k is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is adjusted based on conditions, `s` is adjusted based on conditions, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`m` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is adjusted based on conditions, `s` is adjusted based on conditions, `k` is incremented by 1**
