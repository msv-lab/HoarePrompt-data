Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers, and the loop may execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers, and the loop may execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
