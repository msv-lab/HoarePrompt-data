Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues the loop execution based on the given conditions. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.**
