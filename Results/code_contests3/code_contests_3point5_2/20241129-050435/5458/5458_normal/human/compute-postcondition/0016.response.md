Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values with dimensions determined by the values of M and S, k is 1, i is 0, j is 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k.
