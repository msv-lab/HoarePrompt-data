Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m+1`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive), `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `j` is less than `m+1`, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to S (inclusive), `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
