Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, dp is a 2D list with updated values, k is 2. The values in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated to be the result of the modulo operation between the values in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] and mod based on the provided code snippet.**
