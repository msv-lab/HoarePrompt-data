According to the code, the loop will execute `s` number of times, where `s` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 but still be less than or equal to `m`. So the states that need to be adjusted before the loop starts are as follows:

State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `M`, `i`, `k` are updated according to loop conditions**
