According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is also an integer. Since `k` is being iterated over, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s]`**
