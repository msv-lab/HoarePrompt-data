Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts, `k` is 2. After the execution of the if else block, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if i == 0. Otherwise, the values in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] are updated to be the result of the modulo operation between the values in dp at index [i + 1 & 1][j][k] and mod based on the provided code snippet.***
