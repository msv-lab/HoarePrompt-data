Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: At the end of the execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the remainder of the division of the updated value by `mod`.
Output State: **At the end of the execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the remainder of the division of the updated value by `mod`**
