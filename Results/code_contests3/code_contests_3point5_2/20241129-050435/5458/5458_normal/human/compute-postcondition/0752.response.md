According to the given code and conditions, to execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

If `i == 0`, then:
- `m` should remain greater than or equal to 1
- `n` should remain less than `n^2 - 1`
- `s` should remain at least 1
- `k` should be incremented by 1

If `j >= k`, then:
- `m` should remain greater than or equal to 1
- `n` should remain less than `n^2 - 1`
- `s` should remain at least 1
- `k` should be incremented by 1
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1

If `j < k`, then:
- `m`, `n`, `s`, and `k` should be updated based on other conditions
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated as mentioned

So, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`m` is adjusted based on conditions, `n` is adjusted based on conditions, `s` is adjusted based on conditions, `k` is incremented by 1**
