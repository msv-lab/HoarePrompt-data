According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers, `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. for the loop to execute another time `j` should be less than `m`**
