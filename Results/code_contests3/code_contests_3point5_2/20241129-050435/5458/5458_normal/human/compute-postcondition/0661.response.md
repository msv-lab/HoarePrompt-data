According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows:
- `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers.
- If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is calculated as `dp[i & 1][j][s] % mod`.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute again, the value of `j` must be less than `m + 1`. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j is incremented by 1`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `m + 1`**
