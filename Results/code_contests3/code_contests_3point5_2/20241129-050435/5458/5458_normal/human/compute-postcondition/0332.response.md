According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s+1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
