Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the current state. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and `k` is incremented by 1.***
