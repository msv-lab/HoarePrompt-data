Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration of the loop. This means that the loop will be executed one more time based on the loop conditions and assignments. The values of the variables are updated based on these conditions and assignments, but the exact values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, Mod, DP, i, j, and k are updated based on the loop conditions and assignments to execute the loop one more time.
Output State: **N, M, S, Mod, DP, i, j, and k are updated based on the loop conditions and assignments to execute the loop one more time**
