Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, `j` must be less than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` must be updated. If `j >= k`, the loop will continue executing with the updated values as described above. If `j > k`, the loop will continue executing with the updated values as described above, but `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
