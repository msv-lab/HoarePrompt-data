Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. Mod is assigned the value 100000. DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments. i is incremented by 1, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time m is greater than 0. If i == 0, then if j ≥ k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if i != 0, and if j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
