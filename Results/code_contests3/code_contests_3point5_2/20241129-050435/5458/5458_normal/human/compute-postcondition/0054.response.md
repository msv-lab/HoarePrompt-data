Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `M`, `i` is updated to 1, `k` remains the same, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `M`, `i`, `k` are updated according to loop conditions. Additionally, when `j > k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
