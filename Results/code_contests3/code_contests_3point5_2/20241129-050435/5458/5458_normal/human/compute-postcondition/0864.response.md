According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop can execute, the following states should be adjusted: `i`, `j+1`, `s`, `k` is 1, `n`, `m`, `mod` are integers, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is determinable for all iterations.
