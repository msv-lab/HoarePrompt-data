Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
