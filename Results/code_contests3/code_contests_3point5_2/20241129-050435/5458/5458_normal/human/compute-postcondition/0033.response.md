Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
