According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m` after incrementing by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` will remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m` + 1**
