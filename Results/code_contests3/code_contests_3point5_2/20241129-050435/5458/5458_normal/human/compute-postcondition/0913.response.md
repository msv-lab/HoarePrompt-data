Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` remain unchanged. For the if part, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For the else part, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.**
