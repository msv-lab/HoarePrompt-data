According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, s` is greater than 0. Since the values of `k`, `i`, `j`, and `mod` are unknown, we need to focus on the value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, so the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`, and it should still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is `j + 1` and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`.**
