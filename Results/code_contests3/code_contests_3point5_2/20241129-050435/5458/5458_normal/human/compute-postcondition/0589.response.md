Postcondition: ***`s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer value, `i` can be any integer value, and `k` must be in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
