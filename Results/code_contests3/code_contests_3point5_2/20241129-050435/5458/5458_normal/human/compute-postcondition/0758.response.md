Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of `m`, `n`, and `s` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged. If `j > k`, then `k` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s` are adjusted based on conditions. `k` is incremented by 1 if `j > k`.**
