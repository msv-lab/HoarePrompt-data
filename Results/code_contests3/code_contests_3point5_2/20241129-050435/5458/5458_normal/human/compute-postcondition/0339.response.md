Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
