Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i` and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k**`
