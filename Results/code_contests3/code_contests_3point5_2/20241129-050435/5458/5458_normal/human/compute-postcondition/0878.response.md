Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `k+1`, `n`, `m`, `mod`, remain integers. If `j >= k+1`, `i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is now 1. If `j` is greater than `k+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][(k+1)] % mod**
