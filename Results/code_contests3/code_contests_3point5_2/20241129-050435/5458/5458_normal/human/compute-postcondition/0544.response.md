Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, `j` becomes 2, and `k` becomes 2. As for the condition `k` must be less than or equal to `s` to execute the loop one more time, it depends on the value of `s`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, we don't have enough information to determine the exact state of `s` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k` is increased by 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k` is increased by 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
