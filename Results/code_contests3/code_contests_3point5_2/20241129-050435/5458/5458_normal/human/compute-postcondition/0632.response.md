The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, the new value is assigned to `dp[1][2][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1**
