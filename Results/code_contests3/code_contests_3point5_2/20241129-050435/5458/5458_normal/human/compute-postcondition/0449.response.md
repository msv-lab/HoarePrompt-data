Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and either `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 or if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will maintain the stated initial conditions and execute the specified updates on `dp`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
