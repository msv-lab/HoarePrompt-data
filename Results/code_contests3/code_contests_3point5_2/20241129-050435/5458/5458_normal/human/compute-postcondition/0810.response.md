Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are all increased by 1 in the initial state, the new values are `i+1`, `j+1`, and `k+1`. For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 2`, so the loop will run for values of `j` up to `m + 3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`.
Output State: **`m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`**
