Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the provided Python code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
