Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change in this operation. Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2**
