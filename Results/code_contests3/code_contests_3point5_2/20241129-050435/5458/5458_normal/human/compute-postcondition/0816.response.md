Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1 before the operation. The specific values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `m` is increased by 1, `n` is increased by 1, `s` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`m` is increased by 1, `n` is increased by 1, `s` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1**
