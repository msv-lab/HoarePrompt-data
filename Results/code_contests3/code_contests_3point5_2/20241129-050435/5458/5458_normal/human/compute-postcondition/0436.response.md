Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 or `i` is not equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations described in the else part of the code.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 or `i` is not equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations described in the else part of the code**
