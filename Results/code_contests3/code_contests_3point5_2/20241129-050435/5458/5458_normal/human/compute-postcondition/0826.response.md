Postcondition: ***`m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1` for the next iteration of the loop. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j` for the next iteration of the loop, `k+1` for the next iteration of the loop, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions met.***
