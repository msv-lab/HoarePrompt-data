Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 
Based on the provided initial state and the given code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3, value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
