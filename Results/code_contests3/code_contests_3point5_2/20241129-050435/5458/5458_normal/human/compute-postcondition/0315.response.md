Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. Mod is assigned the value 100000. DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments. The final values of i, j, and k are dependent on the conditions of the loop. The loop will execute for all values of j from 1 to M and for all values of k from 1 to S. The values in the DP list will be updated according to the conditions within the loop. The value of dp[n]***
