According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the program state remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers.**
