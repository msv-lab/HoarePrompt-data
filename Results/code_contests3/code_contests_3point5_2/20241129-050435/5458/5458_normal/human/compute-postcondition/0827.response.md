Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all increased by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions met.**
