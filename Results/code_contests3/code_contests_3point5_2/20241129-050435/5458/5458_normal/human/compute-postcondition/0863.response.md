According to the code, the loop executes from 1 to m inclusive based on the variable `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `mod` are integers. The loop executed for `j` from 1 to m, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `mod` are integers, if the loop executes `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is determinable for all iterations**
