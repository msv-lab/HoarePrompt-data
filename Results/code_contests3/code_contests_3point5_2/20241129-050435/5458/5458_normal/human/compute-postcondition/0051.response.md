Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `M`, `i`, `k` are updated according to loop conditions. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. When `j > k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
