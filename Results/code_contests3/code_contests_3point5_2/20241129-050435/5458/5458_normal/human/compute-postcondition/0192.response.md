Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are the same as before and `i` is incremented by 1. After the assignment, the loop will execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` for the loop to execute another time**
