According to the code, the loop can execute up to `n**2` iterations. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` will remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1**
