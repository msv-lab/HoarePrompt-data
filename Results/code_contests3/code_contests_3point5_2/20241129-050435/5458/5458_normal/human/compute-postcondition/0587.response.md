According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is between 1 and `s`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the values of `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **At the end of all iterations, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer value, `i` can be any integer value, and `k` must be in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive.**
