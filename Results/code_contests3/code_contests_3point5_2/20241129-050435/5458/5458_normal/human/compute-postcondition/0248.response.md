Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, Mod is assigned the value 100000, DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments, i is incremented by the total number of times the loop has executed, j is assigned the value m+1 for the loop to execute the first time k is 1, i is equal to 0. The value of j is greater than or equal to k. After the if-else block, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1***
