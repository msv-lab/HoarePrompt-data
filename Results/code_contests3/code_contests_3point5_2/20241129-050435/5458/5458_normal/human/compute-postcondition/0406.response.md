Postcondition: ***1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2. If i == 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
