Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known. Since `j` is 1 and `k` is greater than `j`, the assignment takes place. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` are integers. `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` are integers. `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values**
