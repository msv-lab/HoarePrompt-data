Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `(i != 0)`, and `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or program execution.
Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `(i != 0)`, and `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or program execution.**
