According to the code, the loop can execute another time if `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `m`. Since `j` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Additionally, `k` is incremented by 1 during each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, `j + 1` should still be less than `m`. Also, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers. `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. For the loop to execute another time `j` should be less than `m`, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.**
