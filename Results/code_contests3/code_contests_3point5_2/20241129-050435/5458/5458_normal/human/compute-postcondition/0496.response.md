Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged. The program continues with the loop until `j` becomes greater than `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m` + 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and the loop continues with updated values of `j` and `k`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than `m` + 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and the loop continues with updated values of `j` and `k**.
