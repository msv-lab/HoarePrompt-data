Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
