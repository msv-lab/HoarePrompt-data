According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` needs to be set to 1 if `k` is equal to `s`.
State: **`s`, `j`, and `i` remain integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1 and if `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is set to 1**
