According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0`, then `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`s`, `k` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s**.
