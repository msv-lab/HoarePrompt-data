According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k`, `s`, and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute, `k` should be updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions and assignments within the loop, `i`, `j`, and `k` have been updated according to the loop conditions and assignments. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is updated to the next value and checked if it is less than or equal to `s`.**
