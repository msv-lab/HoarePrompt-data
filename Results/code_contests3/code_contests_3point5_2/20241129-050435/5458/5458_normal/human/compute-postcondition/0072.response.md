Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, `k` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `S`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then the mentioned assignments are carried out. If `i == 0`, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated based on the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and if `j > k`, `k` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `S`.***
