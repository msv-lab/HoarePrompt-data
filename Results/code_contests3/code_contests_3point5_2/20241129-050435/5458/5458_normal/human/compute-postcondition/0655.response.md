Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same. If the loop condition (`k` less than or equal to `s + 1`) is satisfied, the loop will execute one more time. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k + 2`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` are all integers, and the loop may execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
