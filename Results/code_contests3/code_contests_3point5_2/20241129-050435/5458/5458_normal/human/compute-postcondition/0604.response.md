Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer, `i` is either 0 (incremented by 1 and set to 1) or not 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive, value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues without any other changes.**
