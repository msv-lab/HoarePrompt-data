Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` are integers, `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` are integers, `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
