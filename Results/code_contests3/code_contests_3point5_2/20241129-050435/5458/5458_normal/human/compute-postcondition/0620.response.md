Output State: **At the end of all iterations, the values of `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod` will determine the final values stored in the `DP` list. The `DP` list will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code.**
