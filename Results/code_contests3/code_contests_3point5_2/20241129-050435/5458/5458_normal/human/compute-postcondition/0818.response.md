According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all integers increased by 1. For the loop to execute, `j <= m + 2`. 

If `i == 0`, then after the last iteration `m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`. 

If `i != 0`, then after the last iteration `m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the updated states would be:
State: **`m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j+1`, `k+1` for the next iteration of the loop**.
