According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, and `i` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is applied to update the values in the `dp` list.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` for the loop to execute another time**
