Postcondition: ***`s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer value, `i` can be any integer value, and `k` must be in the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 and set to 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`.***
