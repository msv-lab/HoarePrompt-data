According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. The loop will continue executing until `j` reaches `m + 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
