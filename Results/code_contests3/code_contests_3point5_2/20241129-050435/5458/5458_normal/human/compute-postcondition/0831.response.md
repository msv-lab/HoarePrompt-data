According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k ranges from 1 to s inclusive. The initial state indicates that `i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. In order for the loop to execute, the initial state should be adjusted such that `i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable.
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, for the loop to execute**
