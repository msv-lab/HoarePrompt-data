Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables are integers, and the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the specified ranges, the output state can be determined.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m`. `i` is not equal to 0. In addition, `j` is greater than `k`.**
