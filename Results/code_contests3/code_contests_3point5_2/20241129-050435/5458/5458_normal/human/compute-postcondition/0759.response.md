Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their initial states are unknown. Hence, the output state is: `m`, `n`, `s` are adjusted based on conditions; `k` is incremented by 1 if `j > k`.
Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s` are adjusted based on conditions; `k` is incremented by 1 if `j > k`**
