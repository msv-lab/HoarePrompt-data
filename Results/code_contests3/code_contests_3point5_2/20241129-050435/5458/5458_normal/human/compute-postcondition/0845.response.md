Example Answer: 
`k` is assigned the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1. The other variables `i` and `j` are incremented by 1, and a value of 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`k` is the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
