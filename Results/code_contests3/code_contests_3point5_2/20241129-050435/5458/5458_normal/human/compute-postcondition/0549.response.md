Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `s` and `k` are increased by 1, `j` is 1, `i` is increased by 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues execution.**
