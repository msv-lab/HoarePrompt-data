Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1, we can calculate the new value based on the previous values in the `dp` list. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, dp is a 2D list with updated values, k is 1, i is 1, j is 2.
