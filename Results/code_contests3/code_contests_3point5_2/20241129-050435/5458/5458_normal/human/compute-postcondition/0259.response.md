Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, Mod is assigned the value 100000, DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments, i is incremented by the total number of times the loop has executed, j is assigned the value m+2, k is 2. If i is equal to 0, the value of j is greater than or equal to k and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with Mod.***
