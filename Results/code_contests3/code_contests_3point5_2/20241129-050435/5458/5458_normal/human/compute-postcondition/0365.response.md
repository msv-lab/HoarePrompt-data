According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 1. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2**.
