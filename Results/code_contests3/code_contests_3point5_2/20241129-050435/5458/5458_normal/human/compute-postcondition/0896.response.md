According to the code, the loop can execute for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `i`, `j+1`, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged, `j >= k+1`, `i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is set to 1. If `j > k+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][(k+1)] % mod` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]`. In addition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`i` is 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` is set to 1. If `j > k+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][(k+1)]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][(k+1)] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
