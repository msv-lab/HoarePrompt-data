Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, Mod is assigned the value 100000, DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments, i is incremented by the total number of times the loop has executed, j is assigned the value m+2. At the end of the last iteration, k is S. For the loop to execute one more time, k should be less than S. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k.***
