Postcondition: ***`s`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `m` are integers. If `i` == 0, then `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged after all iterations, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is increased by 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged after all iterations, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
