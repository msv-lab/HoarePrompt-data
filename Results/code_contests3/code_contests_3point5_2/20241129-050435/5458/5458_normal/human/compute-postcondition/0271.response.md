Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, Mod is assigned the value 100000, DP is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions and assignments, i is incremented by the total number of times the loop has executed, j is assigned the value m+2, k is S, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. At the end of the execution of the if else block, the program variables retain the same values and relationships as described in the precondition.***
