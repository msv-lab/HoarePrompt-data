Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the formula involves modulo operation `%`, the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not given, so the exact value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: *1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2 and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided.
