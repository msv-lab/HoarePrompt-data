Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0, then `j` and `i` values are updated for the next iteration, and conditions related to `dp` are determined for the loop to execute another time if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, `dp` values are updated as follows: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
