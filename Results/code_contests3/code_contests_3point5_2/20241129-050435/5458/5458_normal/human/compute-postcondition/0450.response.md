Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program executes the if part and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will maintain the stated initial conditions and execute the specified updates on `dp`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
