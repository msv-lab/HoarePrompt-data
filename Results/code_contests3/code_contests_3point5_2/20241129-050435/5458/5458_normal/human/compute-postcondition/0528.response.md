Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, the previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is increased, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged after all iterations, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged after all iterations, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
