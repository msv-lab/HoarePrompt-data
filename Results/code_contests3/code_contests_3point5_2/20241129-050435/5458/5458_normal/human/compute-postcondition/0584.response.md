Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are modified based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If `j >= k`, the value `1` is assigned to the multi-dimensional list `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
