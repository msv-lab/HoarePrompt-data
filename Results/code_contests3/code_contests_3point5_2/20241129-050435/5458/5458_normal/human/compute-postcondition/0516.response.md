Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is updated accordingly for the loop to execute another time if `i` is 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
