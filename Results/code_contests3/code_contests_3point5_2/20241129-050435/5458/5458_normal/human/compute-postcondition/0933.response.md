The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined positive integer variables N, M, and S, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function does not have a specific return value specified, as the output is dependent on the operations performed within the function body.
