Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `s`. `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. For the loop to execute another time `j` should be less than `m`. Also, `i` is equal to 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables and arrays.***
