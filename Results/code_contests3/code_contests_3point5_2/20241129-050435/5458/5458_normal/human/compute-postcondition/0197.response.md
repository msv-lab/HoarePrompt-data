Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k` remain the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program state remains unchanged.***
