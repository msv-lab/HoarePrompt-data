According to the code, the `while 1:` statement indicates an infinite loop, so the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. `mod` is assigned the value 100000**
