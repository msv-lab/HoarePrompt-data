Postcondition: ***`i` is not 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1, `s`, `n`, `m`, `mod` remain unchanged, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][(k+1)]` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` and `m` are appropriately initialized. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k`] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
