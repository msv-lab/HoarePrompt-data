Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but based on the initial state, we know that `k` is 2. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
