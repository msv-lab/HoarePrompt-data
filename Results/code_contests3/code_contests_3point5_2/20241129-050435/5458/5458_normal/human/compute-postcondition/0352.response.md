According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `s` is greater than 0, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` is `j + 1` and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `M` is between 1 and 2000, `j` is 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
