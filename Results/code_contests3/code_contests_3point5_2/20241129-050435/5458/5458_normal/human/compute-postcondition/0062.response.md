Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, and `k` remain the same. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculations, the output state is not explicitly defined. 
Output State: **No specific output state defined**
