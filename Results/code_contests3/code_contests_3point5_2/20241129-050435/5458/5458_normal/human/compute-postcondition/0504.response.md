Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, values of `j` and `i` are updated, and conditions related to `dp` need to be determined for the loop to execute another time if `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, there are no changes in the values of the variables or conditions related to `dp`.***
