Since the loop executes for each `j` in the range from 1 to `m+1`, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` will remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be incremented by 1**
