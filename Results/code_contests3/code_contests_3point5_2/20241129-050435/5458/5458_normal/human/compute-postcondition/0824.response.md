Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j` for the next iteration of the loop, `k+1` for the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated values. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.
Output State: **`m+1`, `n+1`, `s+1`, `j` for the next iteration of the loop, `k+1` for the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated values. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.**
