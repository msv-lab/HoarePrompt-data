According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the conditions specified in the loop body and the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. To determine the states needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated with 1.
- If `i == 0`, `j > k`, and `k` is not equal to `s`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
- If `i != 0`, `j > k`, and `k` is not equal to `s`, the value of `dp` should be updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **At the end of all iterations, `s`, `j`, `i`, and `k` are integers. The values of the variables depend on the conditions specified in the loop body. For the next iteration, the specified conditions need to be met for the loop to continue.**
