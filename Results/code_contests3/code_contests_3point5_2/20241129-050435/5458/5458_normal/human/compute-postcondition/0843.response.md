Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `s`, `k` are integers. `n`, `m`, and `mod` are constants. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable for the loop execution. In this case, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is accurately determinable, the program continues the loop execution accordingly. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and then adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
