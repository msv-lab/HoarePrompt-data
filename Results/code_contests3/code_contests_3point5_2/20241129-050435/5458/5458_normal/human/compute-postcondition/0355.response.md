Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to 1.
