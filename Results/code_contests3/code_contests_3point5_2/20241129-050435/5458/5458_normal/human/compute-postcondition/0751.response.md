Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1. If `i == 0`, then `m`, `n`, `s`, and `k` are updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `j >= k`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is less than `n^2 - 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `n`, `s`, and `k` are updated based on other conditions. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
