Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to the multi-dimensional list `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are modified based on the conditions specified in the loop body, but their previous values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The value `1` is assigned to the multi-dimensional list `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **The value `1` is assigned to the multi-dimensional list `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
