Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. The value of `j` can be any integer less than `m + 1`, and the value of `k` is equal to `j`, which satisfies the condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers, `j` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers, `j` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
