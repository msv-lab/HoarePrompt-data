According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is adjusted to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1. If `i` == 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `k` is set to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. So for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`k` is adjusted to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, `i` is adjusted to the current value plus 1, `j` is adjusted to the current value plus 1, if `i` == 0 and `j` >= `k` then `k` is set to the next value in the range of 1 to s + 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**.
