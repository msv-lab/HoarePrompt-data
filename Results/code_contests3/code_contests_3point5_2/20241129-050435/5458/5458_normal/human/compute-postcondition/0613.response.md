Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` can be any integer, `i` is either 0 or not 0, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `dp` array has been updated with the new value based on the given condition, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
