Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`. The inner lists are initialized with zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are input integers**
