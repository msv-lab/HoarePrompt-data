Output State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are all increased by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0. After entering the if condition where `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
