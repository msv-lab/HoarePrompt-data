According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and k is now 1. 
State: **1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
