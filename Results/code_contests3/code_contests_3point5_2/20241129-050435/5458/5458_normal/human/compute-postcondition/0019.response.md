Example Answer: 
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the remainder of dividing the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is also incremented by 1, but `k` remains the same. Since `i` is not 0, the program continues from this point. The dimensions of the `dp` list remain the same. 
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, dp is a 2D list with updated values, k is 1, i is 1, j is 2.**
