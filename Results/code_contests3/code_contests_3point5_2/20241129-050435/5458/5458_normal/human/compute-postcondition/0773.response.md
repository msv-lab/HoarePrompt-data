Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
