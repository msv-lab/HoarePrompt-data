Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` are increased by 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
