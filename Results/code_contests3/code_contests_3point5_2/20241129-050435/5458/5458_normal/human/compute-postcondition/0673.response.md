Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` are all integers. `j` is less than `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `s` is at least 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` remains equal to `dp[(i + 1) & 1][j][s + 1]. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
