Example Answer:
The keyword `continue` is encountered, which skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. The values of the variables remain the same, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is incremented by 1 but still less than or equal to `S`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then the mentioned assignments are carried out.
