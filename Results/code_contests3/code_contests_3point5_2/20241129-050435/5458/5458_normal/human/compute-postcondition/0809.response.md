According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j`, `s`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all increased by 1, and for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`m`, `n`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all increased by 1, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 2**
