According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

State: **`s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` is incremented by 1**
