According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of j from 1 to M and for all values of k from 1 to S. The loop will execute n^2 times. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, Mod is 100000, DP is a 2D list with updated values based on loop conditions and assignments, i is in the range of n^2, j is in the range of 1 to M, k is in the range of 1 to S**
