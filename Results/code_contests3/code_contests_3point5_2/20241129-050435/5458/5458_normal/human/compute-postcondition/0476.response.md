Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `k` is incremented by 1 to prepare for the next iteration of the loop. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
