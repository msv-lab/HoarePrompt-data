Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
