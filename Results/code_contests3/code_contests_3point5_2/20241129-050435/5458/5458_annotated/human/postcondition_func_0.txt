The function `func` reads input for positive integers N, M, and S. It then performs calculations using a dynamic programming approach to update a 3D list `dp` based on certain conditions within nested loops. Finally, it prints the modulo of a specific value from `dp`. The function continues this process until N, M, and S are all 0. The function does not have specific return values and operates within the constraints of the provided positive integer limits.
