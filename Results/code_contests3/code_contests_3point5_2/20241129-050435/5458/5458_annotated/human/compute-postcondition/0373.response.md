Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, in the else part, `dp` is updated in a specific way depending on the values of `j` and `k`.***
