Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of the variables do not change but the program continues without any changes to the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain positive integers, and the program continues without any changes.
Output State: **All variables remain positive integers, and the program continues without any changes**
