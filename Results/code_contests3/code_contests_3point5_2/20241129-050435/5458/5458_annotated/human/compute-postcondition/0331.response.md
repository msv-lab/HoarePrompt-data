Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, and all other variables retain their initial values. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given formula. In both cases, `n`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain greater than 0.***
