Output State: All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. After the execution, all variables remain as positive integers, with the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
