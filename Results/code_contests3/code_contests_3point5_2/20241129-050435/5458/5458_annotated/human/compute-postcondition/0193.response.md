Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1`, `k+1` are positive integers. `s` is greater than 0. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if i equals 0. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1**
