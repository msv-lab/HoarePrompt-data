Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` could be 0 or 1, `k` has been updated to either `s` or `s + (n * s)`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. The loop will only execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, when `j >= k`, the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if part.***
