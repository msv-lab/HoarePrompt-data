Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `k` is either incremented by `s` or `s + (n * s)`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
