Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by `s`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
