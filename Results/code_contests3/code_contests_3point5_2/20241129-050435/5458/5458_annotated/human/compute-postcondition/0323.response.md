Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros. For the case where `j >= k`, the new values are updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. Additionally, the condition `j >= k` holds true.***
