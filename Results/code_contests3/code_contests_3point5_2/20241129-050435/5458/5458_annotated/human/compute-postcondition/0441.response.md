Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. After the if else block executes, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the conditions: if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` > `k`, the new value is calculated by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and incrementing it by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
