According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. After the execution of the loop body, `k` is incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1`, `k` is a positive integer incremented by 1**
