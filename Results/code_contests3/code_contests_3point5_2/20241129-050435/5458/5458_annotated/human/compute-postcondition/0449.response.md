Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement if `j` is greater than `k`. The new value assigned is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
