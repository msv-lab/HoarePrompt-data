According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 as it goes through the range of `1` to `s+1`.
State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
