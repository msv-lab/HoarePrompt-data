Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then all variables remain the same except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
