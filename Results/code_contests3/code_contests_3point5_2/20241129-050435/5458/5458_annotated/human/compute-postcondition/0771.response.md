Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is now equal to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
