Postcondition: ***`k` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and updated by adding the modulus of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
