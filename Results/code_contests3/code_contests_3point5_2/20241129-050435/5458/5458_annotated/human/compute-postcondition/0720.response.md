Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are variables with specific values. The state of `dp` changes based on the assignment. Other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, `k` is less than `s + 1**.
