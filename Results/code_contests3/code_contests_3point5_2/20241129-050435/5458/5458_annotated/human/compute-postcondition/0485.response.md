According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, and `s` is at least 1. Since `j` is equal to `s` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`.

State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `j` is less than `m`**
