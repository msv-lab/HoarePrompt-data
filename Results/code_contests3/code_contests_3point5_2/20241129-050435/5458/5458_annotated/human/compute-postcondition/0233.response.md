According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute another time**
