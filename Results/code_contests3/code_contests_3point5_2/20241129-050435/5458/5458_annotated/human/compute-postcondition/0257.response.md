According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m+2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0. 

1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is `m+2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to increment `k` by 1 to continue the loop.

State: **`j` is `m+2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**

2. If `i` is not 0, `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is not 0, `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to increment `k` by 1 to continue the loop.

State: **`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
