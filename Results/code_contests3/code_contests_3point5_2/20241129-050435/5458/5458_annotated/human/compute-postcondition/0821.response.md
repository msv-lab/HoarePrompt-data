Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is 1, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, and `k` is `s` incremented by 2, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
