Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` either equals 1 or 2, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, for the loop to execute the next time `m` is at least 1 and the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`. If `j` > `k`, the new values are assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
