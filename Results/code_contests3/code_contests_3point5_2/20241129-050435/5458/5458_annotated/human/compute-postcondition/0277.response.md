According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute for `s` greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 4`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` should be 1, `s` should be greater than or equal to 1, `i` should be either 0 or not equal to 0, and `j` should be `m`.

State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
