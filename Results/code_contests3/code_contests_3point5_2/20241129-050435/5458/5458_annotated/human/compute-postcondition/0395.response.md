Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is increased by `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`, `m` is increased by `n`, `n` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is increased by `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`, `m` is increased by `n`, `n` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
