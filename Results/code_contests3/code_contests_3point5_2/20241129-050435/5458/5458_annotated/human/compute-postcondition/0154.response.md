Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Then, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. Since the initial state values are not provided, the output state is not fully determinable. 
Output State: **The output state is not fully determinable due to lack of initial state values.**
