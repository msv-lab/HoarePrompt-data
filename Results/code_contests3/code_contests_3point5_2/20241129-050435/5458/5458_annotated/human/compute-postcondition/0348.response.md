Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s` and the assignment is made for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
