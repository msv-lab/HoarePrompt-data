Postcondition: ***`j` is `m+2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
