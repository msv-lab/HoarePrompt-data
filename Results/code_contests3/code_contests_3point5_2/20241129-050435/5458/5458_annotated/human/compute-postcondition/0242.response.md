Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the result of the modulo operation is assigned to the specified index in the dp array.**
