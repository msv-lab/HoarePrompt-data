Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute another time**
