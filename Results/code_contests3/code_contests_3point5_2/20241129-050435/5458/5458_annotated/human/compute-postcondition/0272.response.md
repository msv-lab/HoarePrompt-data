Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided, so the output state is: `j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0.
Output State: **`j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
