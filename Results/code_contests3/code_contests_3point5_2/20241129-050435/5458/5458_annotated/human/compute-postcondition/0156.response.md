According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=2`, `k+1` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k+1` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`.**
