Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided, but based on the given initial state where all variables are positive integers and certain conditions are met, the output state can be inferred as follows:
Output State: **All variables remain positive integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
