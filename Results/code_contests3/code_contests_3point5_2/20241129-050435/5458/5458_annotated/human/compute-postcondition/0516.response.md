Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the specified element in dp is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as the remainder of the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
