Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i + 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` are affected by the previous states of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `i` is not 0, `i + 1` becomes `i + 1`, `j` is `m + 3` so `j + 1` becomes `m + 4`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
