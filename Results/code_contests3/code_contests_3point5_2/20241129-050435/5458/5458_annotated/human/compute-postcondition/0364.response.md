Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. In the if part, `i` is equal to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. In the else part, `i` is not equal to 0, a new value is calculated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
