Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2, and if `j` > `k`, the new value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
