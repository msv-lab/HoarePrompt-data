Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+2`, `k` is a positive integer incremented by 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+2`, `k` is a positive integer incremented by 1**
