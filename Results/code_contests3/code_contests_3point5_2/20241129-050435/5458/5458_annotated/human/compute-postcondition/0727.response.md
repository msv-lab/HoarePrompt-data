Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions in the loop code for all iterations, ensuring that the values are correctly updated and incremented according to the specified logic.**
