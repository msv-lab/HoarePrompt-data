Postcondition: ***At the start of the next iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` could be 0 or 1, `k` is either incremented by `s` or `s + (n * s)`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Moreover, `j` is greater than `k`***
