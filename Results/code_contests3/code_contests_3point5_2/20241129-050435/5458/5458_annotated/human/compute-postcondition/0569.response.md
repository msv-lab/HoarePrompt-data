Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 1 or `i`, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the values of `i` and `j` are updated accordingly.***
