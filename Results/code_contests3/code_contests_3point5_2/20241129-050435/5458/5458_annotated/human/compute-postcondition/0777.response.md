Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
