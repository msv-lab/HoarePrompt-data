Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the provided code snippet. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`. The loop will execute one more time with `k` being 3.***
