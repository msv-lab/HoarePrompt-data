Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since the initial state is given as `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, and the modulo operation result is assigned to the specified index in the dp array, calculations are based on those values. After the execution, the Output State is: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, and the result of the modulo operation is assigned to the specified index in the dp array.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, and the result of the modulo operation is assigned to the specified index in the dp array**.
