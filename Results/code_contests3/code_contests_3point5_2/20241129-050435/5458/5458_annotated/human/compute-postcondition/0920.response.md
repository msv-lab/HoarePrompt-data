Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` is 1 if `i == 0` and could be 0 or 1 if `i != 0`, `k` is updated to `k + 2` if `k + 2 <= s`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. The new value in dp is 1 for the specified indices.**
