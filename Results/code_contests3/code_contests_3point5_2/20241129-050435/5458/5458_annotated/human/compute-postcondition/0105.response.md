Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the values of all variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the given conditions.***
