Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, j is 1, n, m, and s are greater than 0, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition (j > k) holds true. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
