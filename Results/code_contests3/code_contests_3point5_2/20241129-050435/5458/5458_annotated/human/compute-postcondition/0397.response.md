Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `m` is increased by `n`, `n` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.***
