Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1`, `k` are positive integers. After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be dependent on the conditions inside the loop. If the loop executes, the values will change based on the conditions and operations within the loop. If the loop does not execute, the variables will retain their initial values.**
