Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The new value at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the values at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` have been updated accordingly after the if else block executes.***
