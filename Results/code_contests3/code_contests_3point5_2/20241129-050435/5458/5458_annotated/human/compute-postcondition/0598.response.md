Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
