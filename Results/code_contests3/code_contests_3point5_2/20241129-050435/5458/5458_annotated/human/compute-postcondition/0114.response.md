Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. When the if condition `(i == 0)` is true, the value of `i` is 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
