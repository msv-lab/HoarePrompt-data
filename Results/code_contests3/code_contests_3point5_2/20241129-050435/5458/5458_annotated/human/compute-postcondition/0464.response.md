Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, i is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the mentioned calculation.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, i is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the mentioned calculation**
