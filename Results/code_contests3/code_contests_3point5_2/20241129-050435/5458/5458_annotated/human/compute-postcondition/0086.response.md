Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided**
