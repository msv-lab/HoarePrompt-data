Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is toggled between 0 and 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j` is greater than 3, the conditions mentioned before remain true. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
