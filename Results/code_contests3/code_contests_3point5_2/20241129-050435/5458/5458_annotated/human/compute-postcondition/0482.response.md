Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 3 if `j` is greater than `k. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of the value at dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k].**
