According to the code, the `while` loop will continue to execute indefinitely as it is a `while 1` loop, which means it will run as long as the condition is true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, and the code snippet prints the modulo of the value at `dp[n]`**
