Example Answer:
The code snippet continues without making any changes to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **All variables remain as positive integers, with the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
