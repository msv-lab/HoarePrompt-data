Output State: **All variables remain positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute one more time with `k` being 3.**
