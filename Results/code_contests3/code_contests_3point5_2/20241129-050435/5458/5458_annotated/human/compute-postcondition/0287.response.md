Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned**
