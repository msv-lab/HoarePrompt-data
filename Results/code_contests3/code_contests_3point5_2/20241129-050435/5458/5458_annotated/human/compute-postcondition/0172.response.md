Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of the other variables remain positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain positive integers, except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is calculated based on the mentioned formula.
Output State: **All variables remain positive integers, except `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is calculated based on the mentioned formula**
