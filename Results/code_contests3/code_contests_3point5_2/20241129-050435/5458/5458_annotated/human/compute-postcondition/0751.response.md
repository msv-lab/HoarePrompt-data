Postcondition: ***`k` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` and `j` meet the specified conditions for updating `dp`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` in the `dp` list. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
