Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, i is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
