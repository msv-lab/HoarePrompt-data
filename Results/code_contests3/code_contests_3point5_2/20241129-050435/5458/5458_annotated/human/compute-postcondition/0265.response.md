Postcondition: ***`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then there is no change in the state of the program variables. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will either remain 1 if `j >= k` or will be incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` depending on the condition***
