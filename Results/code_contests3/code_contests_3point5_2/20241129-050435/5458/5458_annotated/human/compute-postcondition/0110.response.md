According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is now 1. 
State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
