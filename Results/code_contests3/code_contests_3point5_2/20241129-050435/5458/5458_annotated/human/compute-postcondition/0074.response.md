According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `m + 1`**
