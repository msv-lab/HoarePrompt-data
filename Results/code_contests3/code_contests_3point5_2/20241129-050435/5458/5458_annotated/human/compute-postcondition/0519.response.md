According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the value of `i` is less than `(n ** 2) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` can be any value between 0 and `(n ** 2) - 1` (inclusive), `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0**
