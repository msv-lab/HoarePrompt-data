Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is 1, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1 and the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. After the if condition `j >= k`, the new value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as 1.***
