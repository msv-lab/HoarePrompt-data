Postcondition: ***`k` is less than or equal to `s`, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` and `j` meet the specified conditions for updating `dp`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1. After the if statement executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
