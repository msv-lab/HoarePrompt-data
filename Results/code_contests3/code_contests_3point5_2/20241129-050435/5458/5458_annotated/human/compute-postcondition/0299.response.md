According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0** for the loop to execute one more time.
