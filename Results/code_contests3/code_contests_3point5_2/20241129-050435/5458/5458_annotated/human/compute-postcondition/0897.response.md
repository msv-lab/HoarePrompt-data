According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` being a 3D list with updated values does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is incremented by `s` or `s + (n * s)`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`.
State: **At the start of the next iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by 1, `i` could be 0 or 1, `k` is either incremented by `s` or `s + (n * s)`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**.
