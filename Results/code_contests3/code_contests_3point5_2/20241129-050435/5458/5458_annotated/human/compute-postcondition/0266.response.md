According to the code, the loop can execute depending on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0. For the next iteration of the loop, `k` will be incremented by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
