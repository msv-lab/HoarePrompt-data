Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the specific element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the calculated value based on the conditions of the else part.***
