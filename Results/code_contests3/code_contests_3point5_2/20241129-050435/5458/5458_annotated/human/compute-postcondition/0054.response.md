Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are all `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.***
