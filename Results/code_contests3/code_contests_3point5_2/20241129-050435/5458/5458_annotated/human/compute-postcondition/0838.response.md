Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `i + 1 & 1` will always be the opposite of the current value of `i`. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` becomes 2. The value of `k` is incremented by `s`, and `k` remains the same as no specific value was given for `s`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is 1, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1 and the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
