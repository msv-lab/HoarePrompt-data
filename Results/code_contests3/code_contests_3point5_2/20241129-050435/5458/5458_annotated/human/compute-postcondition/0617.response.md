Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
