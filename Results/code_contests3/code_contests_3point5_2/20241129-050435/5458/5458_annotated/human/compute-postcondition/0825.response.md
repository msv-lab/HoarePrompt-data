Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
