Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the new value at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
