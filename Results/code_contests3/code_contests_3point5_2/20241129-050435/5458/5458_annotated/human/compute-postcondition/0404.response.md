Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j` increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`, conditions related to `i`, `m`, `n`, and `j` are met, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the same as the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
