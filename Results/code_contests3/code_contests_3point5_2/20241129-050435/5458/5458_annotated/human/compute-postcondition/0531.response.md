Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
