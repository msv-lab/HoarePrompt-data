Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`***
