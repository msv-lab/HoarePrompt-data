According to the code, the loop will execute for all `j` values from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be `m + 1`.

State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer**
