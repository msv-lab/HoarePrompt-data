Postcondition: ***`j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned in the else part.***
