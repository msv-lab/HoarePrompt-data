Postcondition: ***At the end of the next iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.***
