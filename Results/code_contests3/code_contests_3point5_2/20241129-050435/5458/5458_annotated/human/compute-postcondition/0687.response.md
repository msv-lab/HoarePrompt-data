Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, `j` is between 1 and `m+1`, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1. The values in `dp` are updated based on the assignment dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
