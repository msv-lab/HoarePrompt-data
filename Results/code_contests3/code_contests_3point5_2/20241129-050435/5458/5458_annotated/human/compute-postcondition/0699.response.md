Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the new value at index `[1][j + 1][k]` is 1.***
