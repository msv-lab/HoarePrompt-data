According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1` are positive integers but their values do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1` are positive integers, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
