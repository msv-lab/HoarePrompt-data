According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s. The state before the loop starts states that j is m+1 for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, for the loop to execute, j should be m+1, k should be 1, and s should be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
