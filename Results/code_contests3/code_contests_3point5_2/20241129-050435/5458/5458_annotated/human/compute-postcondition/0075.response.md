According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all variables are `m + 1` except `k` which is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be set to `m + 1`.
State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
