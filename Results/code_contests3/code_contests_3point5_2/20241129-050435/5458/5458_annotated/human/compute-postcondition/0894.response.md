Postcondition: ***At the end of the iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s + 1`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. If `i` is 0, the program maintains the same state. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by setting it to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, no additional changes are made to the program state. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by `s + 1`.***
