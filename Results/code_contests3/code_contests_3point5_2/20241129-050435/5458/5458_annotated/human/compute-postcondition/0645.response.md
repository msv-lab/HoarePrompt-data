Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, but based on the formula, the value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k.**
