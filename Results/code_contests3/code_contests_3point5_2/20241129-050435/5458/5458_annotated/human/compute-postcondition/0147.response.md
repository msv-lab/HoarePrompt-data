Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=2`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`. When `i` equals 0, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned to 1.***
