Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not given, so the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
