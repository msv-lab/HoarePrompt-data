Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is between 1 and m+1, `m` and `s` are greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1 and the conditions based on `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be checked again. If `j > k`, the conditions remain the same as described above.***
