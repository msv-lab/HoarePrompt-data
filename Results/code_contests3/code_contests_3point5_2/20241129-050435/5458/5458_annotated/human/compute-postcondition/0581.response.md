Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 1 or `i+1`, `j` is either `m + 2` or `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than 3, then `i` becomes `i+1` and `j` becomes `m + 2`, ensuring the loop continues to the next iteration.***
