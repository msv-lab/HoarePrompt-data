Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the code snippet breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
