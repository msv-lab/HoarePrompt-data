Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 1 or 2, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the next time the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values in `dp` are updated based on the provided formula.***
