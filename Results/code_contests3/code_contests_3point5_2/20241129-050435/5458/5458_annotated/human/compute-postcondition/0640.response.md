Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, j is 1, n, m, and s are greater than 0, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
