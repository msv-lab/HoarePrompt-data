Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `j` can be either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, and `k` is incremented by `s + 1`. The total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, and `m` is at least 1. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s + 1`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`.
