Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
