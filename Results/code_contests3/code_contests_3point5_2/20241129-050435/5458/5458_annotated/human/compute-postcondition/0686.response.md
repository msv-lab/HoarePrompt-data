Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, `j` is between 1 and `m+1`, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1.***
