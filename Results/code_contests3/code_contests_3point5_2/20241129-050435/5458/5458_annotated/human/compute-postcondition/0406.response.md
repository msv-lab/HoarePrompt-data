Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`, conditions related to `i`, `m`, `n`, and `j` are met. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` or `j < k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to be the same as the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
