According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. 

State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is `s`**
