According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, dp is a 3D list initialized with zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and k is 1.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, k is 1**
