Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is between 1 and n+1, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the loop continues to iterate with the updated values of `dp`. Otherwise, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
