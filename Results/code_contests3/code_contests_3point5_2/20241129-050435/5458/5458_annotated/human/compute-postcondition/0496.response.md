Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables. The equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed, updating the values in the 3D list `dp`.**
