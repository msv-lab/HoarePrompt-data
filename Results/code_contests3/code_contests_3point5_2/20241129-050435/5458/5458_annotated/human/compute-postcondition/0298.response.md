Postcondition: ***`j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
