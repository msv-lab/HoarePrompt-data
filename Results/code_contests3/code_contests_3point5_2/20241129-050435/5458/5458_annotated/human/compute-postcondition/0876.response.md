Postcondition: ***At the end of the iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. If the condition `i == 0` is satisfied, then `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. On the other hand, if the condition `i == 0` is not satisfied, then `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the updated values.***
