Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment but their values are dependent on the initial state provided. Since the values of `m`, `s`, and `i` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact values of the affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0.
Output State: **`j` is `m + 3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
