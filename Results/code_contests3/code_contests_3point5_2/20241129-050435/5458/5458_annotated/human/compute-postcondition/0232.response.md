Postcondition: ***`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute another time. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][m+2][2]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
