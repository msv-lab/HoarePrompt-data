Output State: **N, M, S, mod, dp, s, n, i, j=2, k are positive integers, m is greater than or equal to 0, i is less than n, s is greater than or equal to 1, k starts at 1 and goes up to s. The condition (i == 0) is false. j is greater than k. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
