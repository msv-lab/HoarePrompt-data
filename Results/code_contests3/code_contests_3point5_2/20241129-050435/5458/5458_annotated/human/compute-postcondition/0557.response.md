Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
