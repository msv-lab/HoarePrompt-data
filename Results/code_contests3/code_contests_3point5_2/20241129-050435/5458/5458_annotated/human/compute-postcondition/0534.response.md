According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions mentioned. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `k` should be incremented by 1.
- The conditions `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k` should be checked.
- `dp[1][2][1]` should be set to 1 if the first condition is met, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` need to be updated based on the mentioned calculations.

State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is 2**.
