Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `k` is now incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
