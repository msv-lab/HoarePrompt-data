Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment operation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
