According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `k` needs to be in the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is now equal to `s`.

State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is equal to `s`**
