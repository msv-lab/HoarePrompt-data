Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values such that its dimensions are `(2, m + 2, s + 1)`.**
