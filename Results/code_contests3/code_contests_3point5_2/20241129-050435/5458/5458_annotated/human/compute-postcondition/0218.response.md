Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
