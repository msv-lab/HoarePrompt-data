According to the code, the loop will execute for each `k` in the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Additionally, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `i` can be either 0 or 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s` (where `s` is less than `m`), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1**
