Output State: **At the end of all iterations, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions specified in the loop for all combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The values of `j` have been adjusted based on the loop conditions, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s + (n * s)`, `m` is at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. The final values in `dp` reflect the calculations performed in each iteration.**
