Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration in the loop and continues with the next iteration. Since it doesn't change any variable values, the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, `j` is between 1 and m+1, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1 and the conditions based on `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be checked again.**
