Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is 1, the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed, updating the values in the 3D list `dp`.***
