Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition `j > k`. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with respect to `mod`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the given conditions.
Output State: **All variables remain the same except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the given conditions**
