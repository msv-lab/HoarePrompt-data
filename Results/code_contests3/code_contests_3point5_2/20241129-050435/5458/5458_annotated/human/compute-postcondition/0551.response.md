Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with `mod`. If `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo `mod`.***
