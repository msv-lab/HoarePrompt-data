According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `i`, `k`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m+1`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- The conditions for assigning values to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` or the dp array based on the values of `i` and `j` should be checked and adjusted accordingly.

State: **`j` is `m+2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
