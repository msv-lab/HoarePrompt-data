Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is between 1 and n+1, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the new value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `i + 1 & 1` is the bitwise AND operation of `i + 1` and 1. Execution continues without changing any variable values.***
