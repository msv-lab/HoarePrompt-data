Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged. The state of the variable `k` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are all `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are all `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
