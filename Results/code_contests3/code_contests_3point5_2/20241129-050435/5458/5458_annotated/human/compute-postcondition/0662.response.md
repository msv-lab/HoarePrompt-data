According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` should be equal to 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, `j` is between 1 and m+1, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
