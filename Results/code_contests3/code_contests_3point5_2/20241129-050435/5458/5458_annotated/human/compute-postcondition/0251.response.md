Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` is not changed, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
