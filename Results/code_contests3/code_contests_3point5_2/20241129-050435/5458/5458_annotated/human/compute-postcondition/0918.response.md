Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` is 1 if `i == 0` and could be 0 or 1 if `i != 0`, `k` is updated to `k + 1` if `k + 1 <= s`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then the calculation `dp[i + 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i][j][k - j] % mod`.***
