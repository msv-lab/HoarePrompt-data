Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` could be 0 or 1, `k` is updated to `k + 1` if `k + 1 <= s`, `m` remains at least 1, the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
