Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
