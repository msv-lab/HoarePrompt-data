Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, and `j` increased by `s`, `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`, conditions related to `i`, `m`, `n`, and `j` are met. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i != 0` and `j > k`, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where the new value is calculated by taking the modulus of the previous value with `mod`.***
