Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not explicitly mentioned, but `j` is updated to `m+2` if it was greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+2`, `k` are positive integers incremented by 1, `j` is updated to `m+2`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+2`, `k` are positive integers incremented by 1, `j` is updated to `m+2`**
