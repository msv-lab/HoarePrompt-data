Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. j is between 1 and n+1, m, and s are greater than 0. k is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, s is greater than 0. i is 0. Additionally, if j is greater than or equal to k, then the loop continues to iterate with the updated values of `dp`.***
