Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `m`, and `k` respectively. Since `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1, the new value is assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
