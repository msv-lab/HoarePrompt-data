Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Here, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`, `j + 1` increments the value of `j` by 1, and `k` remains unchanged. The initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
