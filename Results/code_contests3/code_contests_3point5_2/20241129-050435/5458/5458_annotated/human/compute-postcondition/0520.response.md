According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, `j` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0**
