Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `s`, and `mod` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time if `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time if `j` is greater than `k`**
