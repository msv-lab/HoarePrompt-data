Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
