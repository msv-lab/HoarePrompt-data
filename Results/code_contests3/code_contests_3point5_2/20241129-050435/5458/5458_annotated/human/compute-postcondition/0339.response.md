Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` is incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s` if `j` is greater than `k`. The program continues to the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Afterwards, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
