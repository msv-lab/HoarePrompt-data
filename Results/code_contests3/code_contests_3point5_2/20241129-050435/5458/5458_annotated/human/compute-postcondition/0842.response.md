Output State: At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is 2, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1 and the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without affecting any variable values. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.
