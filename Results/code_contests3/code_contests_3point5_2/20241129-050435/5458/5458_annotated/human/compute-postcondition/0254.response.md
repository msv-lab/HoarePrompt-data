Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `mod` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
