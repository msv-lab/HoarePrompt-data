According to the code, the loop can execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. So, the next value for `k` should be `k + 1`. 
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1**`.
