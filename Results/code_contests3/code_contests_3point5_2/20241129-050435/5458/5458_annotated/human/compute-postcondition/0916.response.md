Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` could be 0 or 1, `k` is updated to `k + 1` if `k + 1 <= s`, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.**
