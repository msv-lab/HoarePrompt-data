According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `n`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1**
