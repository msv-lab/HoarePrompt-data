According to the code, the loop can execute for a total of `n ** 2` times, depending on the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` are greater than 0. Since the loop is indexed by `i` and `n ** 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0**
