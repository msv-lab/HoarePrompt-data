Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be as follows: `j` is `m + 2`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0. The `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code for each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
