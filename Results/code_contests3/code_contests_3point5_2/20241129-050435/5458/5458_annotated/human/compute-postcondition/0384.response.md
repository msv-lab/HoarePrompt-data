According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s` are greater than 0. Since `j` is being iterated over, it needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by `1`, making it `j + 1`.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s` are greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `j + 1`**
