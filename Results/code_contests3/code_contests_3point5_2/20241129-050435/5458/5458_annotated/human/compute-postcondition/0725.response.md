Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `k` is less than `s + 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program executes the output state. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated as follows: the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
