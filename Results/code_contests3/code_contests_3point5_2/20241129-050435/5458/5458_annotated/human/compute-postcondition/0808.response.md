Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is toggled to 1 and `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` should be greater than `k` and the operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed.***
