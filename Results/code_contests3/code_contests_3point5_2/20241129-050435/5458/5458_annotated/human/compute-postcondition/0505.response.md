Example Answer: 
The element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, and `s` remain the same. The Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the specific element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the specific element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo `mod`**
