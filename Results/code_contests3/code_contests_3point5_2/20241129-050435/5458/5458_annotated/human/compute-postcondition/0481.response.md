Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is further incremented by 2. Finally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 3 if `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 3 if `j` is greater than `k**.
