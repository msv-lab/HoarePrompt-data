Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, `k` is 2, and the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k. Otherwise, the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with `mod`.***
