Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the initial state.***
