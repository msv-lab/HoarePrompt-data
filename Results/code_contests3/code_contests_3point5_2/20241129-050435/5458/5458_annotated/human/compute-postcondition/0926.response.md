Output State: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by 1, `i` is 1 if `i == 0` and could be 0 or 1 if `i != 0`, `k` is updated to `k + 2` if `k + 2 <= s`, `m` remains at least 1, the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration if `j > k`.
