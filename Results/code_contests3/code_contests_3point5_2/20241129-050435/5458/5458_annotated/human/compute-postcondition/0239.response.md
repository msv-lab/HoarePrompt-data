Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `mod` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed**
