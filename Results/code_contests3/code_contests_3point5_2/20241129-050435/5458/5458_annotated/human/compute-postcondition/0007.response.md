According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is 0, `S` is 0, `mod` is 100000, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values such that its dimensions are (2, m + 2, s + 1), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
