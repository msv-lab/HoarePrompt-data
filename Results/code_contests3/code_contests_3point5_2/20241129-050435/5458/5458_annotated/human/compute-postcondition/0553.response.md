According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is one more than the previous value, `j` is `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `m + 1`.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is one more than the previous value, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0**
