Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, in the else part, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
