Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all positive integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.***
