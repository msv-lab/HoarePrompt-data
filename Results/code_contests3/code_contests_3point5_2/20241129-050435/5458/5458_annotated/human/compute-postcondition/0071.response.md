Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are all `m + 1`, `k` is 3. After the execution of the if block, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
