Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation. The rest of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, and `k` is incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, and `k` is incremented to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`**
