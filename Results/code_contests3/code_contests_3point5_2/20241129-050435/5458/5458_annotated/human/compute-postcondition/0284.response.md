Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the variables `j`, `k`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `i` is not 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `i` is not 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
