Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is toggled between 0 and 1, `k` is equal to `s`. Depending on the conditions specified in the loop code, different values will be assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as the loop iterates through all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
