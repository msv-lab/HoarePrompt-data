Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The new value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous values, where the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is taken.**
