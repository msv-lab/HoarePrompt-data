Output State: **At the end of the iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is either 2 or 3, `i` is toggled between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, `m` is at least 1, the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with the updated values.**
