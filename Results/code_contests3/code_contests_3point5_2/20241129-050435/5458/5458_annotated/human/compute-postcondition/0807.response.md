Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is toggled between 0 and 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `i` is toggled, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 1, if (i != 0), `j` is greater than `k` and `j` is greater than `k`, the operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed.**
