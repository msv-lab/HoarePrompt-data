Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the raw input into integers. The values of `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the given ranges, so the output state is: N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
