Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0.
Output State: **`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
