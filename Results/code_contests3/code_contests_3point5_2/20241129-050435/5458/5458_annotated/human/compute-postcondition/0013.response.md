Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is 0, `S` is 0, `mod` is 100000, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values such that its dimensions are (2, m + 2, s + 1), for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, and after the if block, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
