According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of n is at least 1. The loop will iterate n^2 times, so n must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, dp is a 3D list initialized with zeros, so it should be adjusted to reflect that the dimensions are determined by the values of n, m, and s. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros, where the dimensions are determined by the values of n, m, and s, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`dp` is a 3D list initialized with zeros, where the dimensions are determined by the values of n, m, and s, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
