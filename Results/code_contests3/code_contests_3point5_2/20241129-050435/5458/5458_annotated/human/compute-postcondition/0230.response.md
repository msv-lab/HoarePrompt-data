Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are unknown, so we cannot determine the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute another time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
