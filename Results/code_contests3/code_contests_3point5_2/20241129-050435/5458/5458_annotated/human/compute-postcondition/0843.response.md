Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` either equals 1 or 2, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is incremented by `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1 and the total number of iterations should not exceed `n`. If `i` is equal to 0, then after the if condition `j >= k`, the new value is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is updated to 2 and if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without affecting any variable values. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
