The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns the modulo operation result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are used in this operation.

Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the modulo operation result is assigned to the specified index in the dp array.**
