Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is now equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.***
