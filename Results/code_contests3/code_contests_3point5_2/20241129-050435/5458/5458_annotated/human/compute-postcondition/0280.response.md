Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. Since `i` is 0, `j` is `m` (which is greater than or equal to `k`), and `k` is 1, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
