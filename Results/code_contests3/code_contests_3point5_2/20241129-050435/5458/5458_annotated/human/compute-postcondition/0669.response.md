Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same, and the values in `dp` are updated based on the condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k.**
