According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since the loop starts at `j = 1`, the state needs to be adjusted so that `j` is 1 at the start of the loop. 
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0**
