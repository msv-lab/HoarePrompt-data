Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. Additionally, if `j` >= `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
