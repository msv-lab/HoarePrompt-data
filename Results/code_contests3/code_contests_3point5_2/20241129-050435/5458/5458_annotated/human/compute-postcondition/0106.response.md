Output State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. The values of the variables `dp` are updated according to the conditions given in the loop code after all iterations have finished.**
