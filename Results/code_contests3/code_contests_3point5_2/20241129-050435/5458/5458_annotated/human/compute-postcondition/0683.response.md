Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is between 1 and m+1, `m` and `s` are greater than 0. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then the new value assigned is 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i != 0` or `j < k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1, and the conditions based on `i`, `j`, and `k` need to be checked again.***
