Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, dp, s, n, i, j=2, k+1 are positive integers. m is greater than or equal to 0. i is less than n. s is greater than or equal to 1. k+1 starts at 1 and goes up to s. If j > k, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
