Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the list `dp` remains unchanged. The specified formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is applied to update the values in the list `dp` accordingly.**
