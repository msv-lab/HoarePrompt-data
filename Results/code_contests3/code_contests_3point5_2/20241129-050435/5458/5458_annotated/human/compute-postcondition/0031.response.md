According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all positive integers satisfying the specified conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
