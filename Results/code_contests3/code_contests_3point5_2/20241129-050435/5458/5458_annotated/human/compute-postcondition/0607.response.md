Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either `s` or `s-1`, `j` is `m + s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
