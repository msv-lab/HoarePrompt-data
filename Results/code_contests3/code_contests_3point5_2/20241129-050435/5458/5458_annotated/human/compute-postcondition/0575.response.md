Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 1 or `i`, `j` is `m + 2`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the values of `i` and `j` are updated accordingly. Otherwise, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or `i-1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
