Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `i + 1 & 1` is the bitwise AND operation of `i + 1` and 1. Since the execution continues without changing any variable values, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k. `j` is between 1 and n+1, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is 2.**
