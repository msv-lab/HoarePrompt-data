Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is `i-1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
