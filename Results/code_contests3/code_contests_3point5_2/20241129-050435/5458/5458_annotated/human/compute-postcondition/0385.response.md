According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. In this case, `s` is greater than 0, so the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` and `j` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be `j + 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is `j + 1`.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i`, `j`, `k` have been increased by `s`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`**
