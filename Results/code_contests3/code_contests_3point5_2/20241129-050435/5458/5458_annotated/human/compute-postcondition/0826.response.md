Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0, then no changes are made to `dp`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the list `dp`. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
