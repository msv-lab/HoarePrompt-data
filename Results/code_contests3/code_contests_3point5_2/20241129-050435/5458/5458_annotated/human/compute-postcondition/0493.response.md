Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
