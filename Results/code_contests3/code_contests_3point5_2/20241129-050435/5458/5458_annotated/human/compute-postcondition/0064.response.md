According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s` which is a positive integer and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j` are all `m + 1`, `k` is a positive integer and `k` is 3, After the execution of the if block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
