Output State: **At the end of all iterations, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` has been incremented by the total number of iterations, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, `m` remains at least 1, and the total number of iterations does not exceed `n`. The final values in `dp` depend on the specific conditions met during the iterations of the loop.**
