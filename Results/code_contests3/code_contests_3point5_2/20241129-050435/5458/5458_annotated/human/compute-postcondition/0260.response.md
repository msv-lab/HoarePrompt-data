Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0.
Output State: **`j` is `m+3`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not 0**
