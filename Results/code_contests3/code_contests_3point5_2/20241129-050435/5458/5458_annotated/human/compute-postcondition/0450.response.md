Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values. `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 3. If `j` >= `k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the new value assigned is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
