Postcondition: ***`j` is `m`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If `i == 0`, the program maintains the same conditions. If `i` is not 0, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `j >= k`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program proceeds to the next iteration without altering the initial conditions.***
