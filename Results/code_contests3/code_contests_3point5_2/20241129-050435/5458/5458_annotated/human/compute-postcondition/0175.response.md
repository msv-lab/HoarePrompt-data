According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so the next value of `j` should be `m + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=m+1`, `k` are positive integers**.
