According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is between 1 and `m+1`, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, and `k` is equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, `j` is between 1 and `m+1`, `m` and `s` are greater than 0, `k` is equal to `s + 1**.
