Output State: **All variables remain positive integers. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1.**
