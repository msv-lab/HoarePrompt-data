Example Answer:
The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the remainder of the division of the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by mod. The conditions for i, j, k, n, m, and s are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k, j is 1, n, m, and s are greater than 0, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0.
