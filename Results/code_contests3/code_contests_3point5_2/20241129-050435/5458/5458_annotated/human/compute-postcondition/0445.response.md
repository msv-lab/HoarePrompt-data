Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, the new value of `i + 1 & 1` will be the opposite of the previous value of `i`. The value of `j` remains constant at 2. The value of `k` is also constant at 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 3.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 3**
