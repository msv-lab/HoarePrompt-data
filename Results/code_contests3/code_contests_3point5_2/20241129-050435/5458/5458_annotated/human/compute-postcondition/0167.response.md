Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=2`, `k+1` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is less than `n`. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `k+1` starts at 1 and goes up to `s+1`. All variables remain positive integers. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 when `j >= k`.***
