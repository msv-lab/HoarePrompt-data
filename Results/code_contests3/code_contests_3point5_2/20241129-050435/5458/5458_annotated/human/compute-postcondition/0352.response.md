According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, k is 1.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` and `j` are increased by 1, `m`, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**
