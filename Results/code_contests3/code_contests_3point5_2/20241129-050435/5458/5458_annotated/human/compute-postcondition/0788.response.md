Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by `2s`, and `k` remains 3. Therefore, the updated value is copied to the next index in the `j` dimension. Hence, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 3.
Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 3**
