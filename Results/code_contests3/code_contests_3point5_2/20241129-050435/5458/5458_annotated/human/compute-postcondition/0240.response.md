Example Answer:
The equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The initial state variables `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After execution, the updated state variables are: `j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and the updated equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and the updated equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
