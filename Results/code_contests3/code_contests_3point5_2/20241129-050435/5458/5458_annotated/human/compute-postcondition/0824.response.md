Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program will continue to the next iteration or statement. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
