Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k.
Output State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values based on the conditions in the loop for all possible combinations of i, j, and k**
