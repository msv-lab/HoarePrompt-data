Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 3D list `dp` by taking the modulus of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. Since `i` can either be 0 or 1, the index `[i + 1 & 1]` toggles between 0 and 1. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and if `j` becomes greater than 3, it will be reset to `2s` (double of `s`). The value of `k` remains constant at 3. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop execution, `dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is incremented by `2s`, `i` is toggled between 0 and 1, `k` remains 3. If `j` is greater than 3, these conditions mentioned before remain true.
