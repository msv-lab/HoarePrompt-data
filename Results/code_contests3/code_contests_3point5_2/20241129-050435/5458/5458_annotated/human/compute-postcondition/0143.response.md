According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, starting from 1 up to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `s`, `n`, `i`, `j=2`, `k` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is less than `n`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`**
