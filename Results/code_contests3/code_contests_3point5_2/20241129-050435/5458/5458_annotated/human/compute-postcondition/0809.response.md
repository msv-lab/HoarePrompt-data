According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `j` is adjusted based on `2s`, `i` toggles between 0 and 1, `k` is equal to `s` incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`**
