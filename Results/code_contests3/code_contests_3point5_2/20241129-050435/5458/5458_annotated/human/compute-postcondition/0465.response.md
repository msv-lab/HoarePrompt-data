Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 3D list with updated values, `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `s` remain greater than 0, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. When `i` is 0, if `j >= k`, then 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the specified calculation.***
