Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by correctly implementing the conditions for creating Bingo cards as described in the problem statement. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given input parameters. The program iterates through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card squares and updates the 3D list `dp` accordingly. Finally, it prints the modulo of a specific value from `dp`. The program continues this process until the input values for N, M, and S are all 0.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created for any given input dataset.
