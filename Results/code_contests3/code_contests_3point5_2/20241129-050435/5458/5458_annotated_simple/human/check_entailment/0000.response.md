Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by correctly calculating the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given input of N, M, and S. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created.

The program iterates through all possible values of the Bingo card squares, ensuring that the integers are in ascending order in each column and that each integer is larger than any integer in the column to its left. It keeps track of the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created using dynamic programming.

After processing all the input datasets, the program outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000, as required by the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description and calculates the maximum number of valid Bingo cards that can be created for a given input.
