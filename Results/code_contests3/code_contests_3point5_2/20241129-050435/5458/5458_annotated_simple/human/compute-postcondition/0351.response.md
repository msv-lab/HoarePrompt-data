According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a certain value, `m` is also at a certain value. The loop will increment `j` by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m**`.
