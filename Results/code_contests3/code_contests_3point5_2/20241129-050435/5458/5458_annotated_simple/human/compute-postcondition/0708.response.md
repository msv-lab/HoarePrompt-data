According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the variables `j` and `k` need to be adjusted. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `s` and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `j` needs to be less than `m + 1`
- `k` needs to be set according to the current iteration of the loop

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`. `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1. `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is set according to the current iteration of the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater or equal to `k`, the condition holds after the execution of the if else block. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` plus the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
