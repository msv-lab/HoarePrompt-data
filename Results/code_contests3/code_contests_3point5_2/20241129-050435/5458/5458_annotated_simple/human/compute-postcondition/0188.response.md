Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is 1, then the program remains in the same state without any changes. If `(i == 0)` is false, the program proceeds to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
