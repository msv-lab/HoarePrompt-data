Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are known, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on those values. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration. The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated and stored.
