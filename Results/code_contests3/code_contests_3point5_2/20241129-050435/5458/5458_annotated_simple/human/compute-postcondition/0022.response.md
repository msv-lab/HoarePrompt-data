According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
