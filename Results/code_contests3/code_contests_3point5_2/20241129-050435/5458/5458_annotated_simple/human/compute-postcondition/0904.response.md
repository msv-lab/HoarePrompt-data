Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of all affected variables are already defined. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
