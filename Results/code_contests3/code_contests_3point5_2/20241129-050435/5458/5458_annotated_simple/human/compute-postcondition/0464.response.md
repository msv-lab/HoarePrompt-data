Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `m` are within the specified range. The initial state of `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` is also within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**.
