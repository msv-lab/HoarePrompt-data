Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with the modulo operation. The other variables remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` at index `n + 1` is updated based on the calculation, other variables remain the same as before.
Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is updated based on the calculation, other variables remain the same as before**
