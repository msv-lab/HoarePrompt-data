Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is updated by adding the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The loop runs for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m` and `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. The condition `i` not equal to 0 and `j` greater than `k` must hold for the loop to execute. The values of `n` and `i` are updated. After execution, the Output State is: `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k.
Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k**
