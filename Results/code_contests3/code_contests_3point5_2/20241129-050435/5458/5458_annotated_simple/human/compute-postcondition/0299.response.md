According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are equal to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, and all variables remain equal to `s`.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are all equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be incremented by 1**
