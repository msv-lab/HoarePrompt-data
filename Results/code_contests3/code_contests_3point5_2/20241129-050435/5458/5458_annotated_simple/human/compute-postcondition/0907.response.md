Example Answer:
The value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n` and `i` are updated. The condition `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` remain valid. 
Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k.**
