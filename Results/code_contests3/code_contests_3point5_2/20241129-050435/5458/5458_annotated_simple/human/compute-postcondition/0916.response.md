Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The values of `n` and `i` are updated based on the calculation. The condition `j` greater than `k` is not explicitly mentioned, so we assume it does not apply in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulo operation, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with modulo operation, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time**
