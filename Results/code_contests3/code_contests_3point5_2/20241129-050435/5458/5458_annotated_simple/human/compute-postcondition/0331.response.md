Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. If `i` is 0, then `dp` is updated, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop continues without any change in the variables.***
