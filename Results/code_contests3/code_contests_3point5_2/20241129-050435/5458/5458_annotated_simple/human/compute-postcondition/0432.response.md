Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`. `k` is 1. `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated based on the calculations***
