Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
