Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, if `i != 0`, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` incremented by 1, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`, `i` less than `n`, `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`.***
