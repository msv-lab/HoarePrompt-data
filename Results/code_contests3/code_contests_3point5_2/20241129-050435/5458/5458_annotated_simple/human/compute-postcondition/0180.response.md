Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program remains in the same state without any changes.***
