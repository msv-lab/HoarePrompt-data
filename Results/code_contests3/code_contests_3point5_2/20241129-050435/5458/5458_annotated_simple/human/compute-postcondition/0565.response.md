Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
