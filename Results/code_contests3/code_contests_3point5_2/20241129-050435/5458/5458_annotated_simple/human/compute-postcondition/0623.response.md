Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned by mapping the integers obtained from splitting the input. Since the `while` loop condition is `while 1`, it means the loop will execute indefinitely until explicitly stopped. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the program state.
Output State: **The value of dp at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`.**
