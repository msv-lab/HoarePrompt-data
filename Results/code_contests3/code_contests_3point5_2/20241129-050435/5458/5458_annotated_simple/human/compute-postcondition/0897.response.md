According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1 and the range of `k` is from 1 to `s`. The state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, and `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned. Additionally, `n` and `i` should be updated as required, and `m` should remain greater than 0.
State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute**
