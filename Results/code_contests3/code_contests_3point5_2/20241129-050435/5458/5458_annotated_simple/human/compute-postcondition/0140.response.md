Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 after the execution of the if else block. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than `s+1`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `j`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. If `i` was equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than `s+1`. No variables are affected if the else block is executed.***
