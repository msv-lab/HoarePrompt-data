Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, all variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m. If i is not equal to 0 or j <= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be the result of the modulo operation between dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. For the loop to execute one more time, the values of k and j need to be adjusted accordingly. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
