Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of dp at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **The value of dp at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
