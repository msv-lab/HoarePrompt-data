Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute. If `i` is 0, then the function assigns the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s` to `dp`. If `i` is 1, then the function assigns the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1 to `dp`. Additionally, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` are updated accordingly with `% mod` operations.***
