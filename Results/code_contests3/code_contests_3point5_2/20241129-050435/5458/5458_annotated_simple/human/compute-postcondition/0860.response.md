Output State: **`dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` incremented by 1, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`, `i` less than `n`, `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the loop or conditional statement, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
