According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is less than or equal to s + 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be less than or equal to s + 2. Additionally, j is 1 and k is incremented by 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be 1 and k should be incremented by 2. At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, and k are integers. Thus, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers, j is 1, k is incremented by 2, k is less than or equal to s + 2, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is incremented by 2**.
