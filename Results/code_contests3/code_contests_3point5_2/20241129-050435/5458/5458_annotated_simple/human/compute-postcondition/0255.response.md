Example Answer:
The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j incremented by 1, k incremented by 2, k less than or equal to s + 2, i not equal to 0, (j > k) true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulo operation.
