According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `m` is at least 1. The initial state before the loop starts indicates that `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`dp` at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
