Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` has a mapped integer value, `n` has been updated to the next value, `i` has been updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` remains at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the new value is calculated and assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is the modulo of the previous value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
