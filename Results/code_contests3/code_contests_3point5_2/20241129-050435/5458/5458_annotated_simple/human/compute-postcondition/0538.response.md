Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block of code. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block of code.
Output State: **The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block of code.**
