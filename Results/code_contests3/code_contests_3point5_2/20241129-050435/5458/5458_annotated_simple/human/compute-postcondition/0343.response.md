Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is increased by 1 and if `j + 1` is greater than `k`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to the updated `s`. If `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1, where `i + 1 & 1` represents a bitwise operation.***
