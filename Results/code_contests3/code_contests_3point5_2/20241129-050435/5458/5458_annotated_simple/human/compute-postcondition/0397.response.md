Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `i` becomes 1, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` remains the same. If `i == 0` and `j < k`, no changes occur. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, the loop continues without any change in variable values. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
