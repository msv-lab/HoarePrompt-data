Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are integers incremented by 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, all variables are further incremented by 1. If `i == 0` and `j < k`, there is no change in the variables. If `i != 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
