Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s > 0`, `j < m` remain the same. If `i` is not 0, based on the condition provided in the else part, when `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, when `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with mod.***
