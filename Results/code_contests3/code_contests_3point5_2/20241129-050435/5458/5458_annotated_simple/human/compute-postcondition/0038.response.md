Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. No other variables are affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s`, `k` are integers incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
