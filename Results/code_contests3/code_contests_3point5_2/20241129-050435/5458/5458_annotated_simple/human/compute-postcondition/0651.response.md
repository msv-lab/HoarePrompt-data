According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. Additionally, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be calculated with the modulo operation.
State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated with the modulo operation.**
