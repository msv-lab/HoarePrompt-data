Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the final values after all iterations of the loop, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute, the values of `dp` are determined based on the conditions within the loop.**
