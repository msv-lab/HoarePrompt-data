Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
