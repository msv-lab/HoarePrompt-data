According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times and the loop can execute one more time if the value of `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` would have been updated at various indices, `n` and `i` would have been updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` would still be greater than 0, `s` would remain at least 1, and `j` would range from 1 to `m + 1` based on the conditions met during the loop execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n ** 2`. 
State: **`dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`**
