According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. Since the loop is using `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, it means the loop will execute one more time when `k` reaches `s + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is now `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` will be `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1**.
