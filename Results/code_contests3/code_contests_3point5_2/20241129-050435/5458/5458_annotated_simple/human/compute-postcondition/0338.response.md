Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated integers, so `i + 1 & 1` is either 0 or 1. Since `j` is incremented by 1, it is compared to `k` to determine if `s` should be updated. If `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is updated to be greater than the current value of `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. If `j + 1` > `k`, `s` is greater than the current value of `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. If `j + 1` > `k`, `s` is greater than the current value of `k`**
