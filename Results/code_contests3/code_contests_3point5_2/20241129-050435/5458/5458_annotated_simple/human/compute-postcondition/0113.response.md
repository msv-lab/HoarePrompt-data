Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
