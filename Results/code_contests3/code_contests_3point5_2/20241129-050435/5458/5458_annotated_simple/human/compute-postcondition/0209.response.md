According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n ** 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s` are integers, `i` is increased by 1, `j` and `k` remain integers, `dp` is determined by the loop conditions**.
