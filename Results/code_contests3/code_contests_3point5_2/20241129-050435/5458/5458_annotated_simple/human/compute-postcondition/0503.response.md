Output State: **All variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m. If i is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be 1 for all valid values of j and k. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be the result of the modulo operation between dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. Additionally, the if condition (i == 0) is satisfied, and the value of j is greater than or equal to k. In the else part, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo operation result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, the variables need to be adjusted based on the above conditions.**
