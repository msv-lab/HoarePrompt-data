According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `s` is at least 1. At the beginning of the loop, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to adjust the state such that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is set to 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
