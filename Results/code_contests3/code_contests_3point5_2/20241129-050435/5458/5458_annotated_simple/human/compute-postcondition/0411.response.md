Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop will execute one more time due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s+1` are updated for the next iteration to execute the loop one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s+1` are updated for the next iteration to execute the loop one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
