According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its previous value. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s + 1`.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1**.
