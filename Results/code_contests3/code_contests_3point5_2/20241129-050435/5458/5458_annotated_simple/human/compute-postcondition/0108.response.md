According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus 1.
