According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i` are integers, `j` is 1, `k` remains an integer, `dp` is determined by the loop conditions. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is now 1.
