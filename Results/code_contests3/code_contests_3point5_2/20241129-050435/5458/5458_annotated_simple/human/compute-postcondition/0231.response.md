Example Answer: 
The dp array is updated where dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. The values of N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. After execution, j remains 1 and k is incremented by 2. 
Output State: **At the end of the if else block, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. j is 1, k is incremented by 2.**
