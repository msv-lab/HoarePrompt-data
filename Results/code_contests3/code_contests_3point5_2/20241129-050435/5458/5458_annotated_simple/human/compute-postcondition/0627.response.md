According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of dp at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, if n, m, and s are all equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0.
State: **The value of dp at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, if n, m, and s are all equal to 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
