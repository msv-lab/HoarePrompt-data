Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` play a role in accessing the elements of `dp`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, the update is valid within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`.
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`**
