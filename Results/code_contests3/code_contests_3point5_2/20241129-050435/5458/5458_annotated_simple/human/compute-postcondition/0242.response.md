Output State: **At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. j is 1, k is incremented by 2. For the loop to execute, k must be less than or equal to s + 2. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After executing the code snippet, if i != 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
