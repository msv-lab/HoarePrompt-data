Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `(i == 0)` is false and `j >= k`, then `i` is updated to `i+1`, `j` is updated to `j+1`, and `k` remains 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod` if `j > k`.***
