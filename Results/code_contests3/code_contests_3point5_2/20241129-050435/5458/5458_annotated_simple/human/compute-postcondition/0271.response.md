Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2. If j > k, and i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If i == 0 and j > k, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k].***
