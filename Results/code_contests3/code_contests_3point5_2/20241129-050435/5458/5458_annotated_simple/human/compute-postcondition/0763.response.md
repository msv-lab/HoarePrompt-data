According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` at index `n + 2` will be assigned a mapped integer value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2.
State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**.
