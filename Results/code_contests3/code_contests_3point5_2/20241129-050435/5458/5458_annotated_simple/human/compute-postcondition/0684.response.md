According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is equal to `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`.
State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`**
