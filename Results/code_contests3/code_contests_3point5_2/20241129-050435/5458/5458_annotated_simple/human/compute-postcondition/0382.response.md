Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `j+1+1` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` have been updated to 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then `j+1+1` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, and the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
