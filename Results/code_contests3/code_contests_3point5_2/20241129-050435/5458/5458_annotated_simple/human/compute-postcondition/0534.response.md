According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**
