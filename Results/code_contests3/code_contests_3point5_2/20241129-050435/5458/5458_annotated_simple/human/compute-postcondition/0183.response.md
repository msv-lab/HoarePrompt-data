Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. The condition `(i == 0)` is false. In addition, `j` is greater than `k`.
