Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated according to loop operations, and `j+1` is still less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations, `j+1` is still less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations, `j+1` is still less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
