Output State: **At the end of the loop, the final state of the program variables will be as follows: `dp` at index `n + 1` will be assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` will be updated to the next value after the loop finishes, `i` will be updated to the next value after the loop finishes, `m` will remain greater than 0, `s` will remain at least 1, `j` will be in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. Depending on the conditions in the loop, various values of `dp` at different indices will be calculated based on the previous values of `dp` and the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
