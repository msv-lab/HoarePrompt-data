Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` equals 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
