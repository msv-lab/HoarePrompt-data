Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the program variables will have `dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, and `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on the conditions met during the loop execution. The final values of `dp` will be determined by the conditions inside the loop for each `i`, `j`, and `k` combination.**
