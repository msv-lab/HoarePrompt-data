Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, k, n, m remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: dp, n, m, i + 1, j, k=s+2, s+1 > k > s are integers greater than 0. j is less than m.
Output State: **dp, n, m, i + 1, j, k=s+2, s+1 > k > s are integers greater than 0. j is less than m**
