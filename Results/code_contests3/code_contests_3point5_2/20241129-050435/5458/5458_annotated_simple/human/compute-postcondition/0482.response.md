Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the modulo value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The previous values of variables are within the specified range, and k is one less than its previous value. If j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m, k is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time k must be less than s + 1. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] if j > k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.
Output State: **All variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m, k is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time k must be less than s + 1. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] if j > k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
