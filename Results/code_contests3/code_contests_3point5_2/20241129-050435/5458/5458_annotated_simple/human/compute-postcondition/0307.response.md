Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are all equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is incremented by 1 if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
