Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
