Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
