According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `k` needs to be set to 1 to start the loop iteration. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` has a mapped integer value, `n` has been updated to the next value, `i` has been updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` remains at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
