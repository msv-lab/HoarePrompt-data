Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is taken from the previous iteration. After the addition, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values and calculations.
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values and calculations**
