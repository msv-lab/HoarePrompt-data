Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: At the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next value in the range.
Output State: **At the start of the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next value in the range.**
