Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is 1, then the program remains in the same state without any changes. If `(i == 0)` is false, the state is updated with `i+1`, `j+1`, and `k` for the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
