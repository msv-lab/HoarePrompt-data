Output State: **`s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` is updated to the next value after the loop finishes, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m` based on conditions met during the loop execution, `k` is now incremented by 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes certain actions based on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
