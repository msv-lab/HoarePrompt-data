Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s+1` are updated for the next iteration. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the program variables are updated to execute the loop one more time. If `i == 0` and `j < k`, there is no change in the state of the program variables. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and then updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***.
