Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j+1, k is s. For the loop to execute one more time, j must be less than or equal to m. If i is equal to 0, and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is then updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
