Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, when `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is not greater than `k`, the loop continues without changes to variable values.***
