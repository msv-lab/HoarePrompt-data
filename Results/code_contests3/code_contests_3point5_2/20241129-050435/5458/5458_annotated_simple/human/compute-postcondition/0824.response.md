Output State: **At the end of the if-else block, the program will have `dp` at index `n + 2` with a mapped integer value, `n` updated to the next value, `i` updated to the next value, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` updated to the next value less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute the second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
