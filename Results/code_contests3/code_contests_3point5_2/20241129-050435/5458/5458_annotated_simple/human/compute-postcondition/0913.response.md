Example Answer:
The value of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is still greater than 0, `s` is still at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time**
