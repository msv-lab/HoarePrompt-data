Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros based on the updated values of `n` and `m`, `s` is greater than 0. When the if condition (i == 0) is true and (j >= k) is true, the program state is as described.***
