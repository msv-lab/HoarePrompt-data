Postcondition: ***`dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` are incremented by 1, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program executes the specified operations.***
