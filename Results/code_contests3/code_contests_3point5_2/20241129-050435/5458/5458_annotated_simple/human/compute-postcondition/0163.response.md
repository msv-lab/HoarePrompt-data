Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state specifies the conditions based on the value of `i`. Since the initial state is not provided here, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: undetermined values based on the initial state.
Output State: **undetermined values based on the initial state**
