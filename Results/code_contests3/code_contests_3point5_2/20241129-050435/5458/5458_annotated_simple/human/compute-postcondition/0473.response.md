Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, so no variable goes out of range. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`.
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`**
