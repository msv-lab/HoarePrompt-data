According to the code, the loop can execute one more time based on the variables `j`, `k`, `s`, and the condition `j > k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`
- `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1
- `k` should still be within the range of 1 to `s + 1`

State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k + 1` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k + 1` is in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
