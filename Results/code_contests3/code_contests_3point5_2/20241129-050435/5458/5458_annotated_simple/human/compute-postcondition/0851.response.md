Output State: **`dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` incremented by 1, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`, `i` less than `n`, `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`.**
