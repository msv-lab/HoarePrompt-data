Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, and `(j >= k)` is true, the assignment takes place. The value of `i` is updated to 1 due to the operation `i + 1`, and `j` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m` and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `(j >= k)` is true.
Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m` and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `(j >= k)` is true**
