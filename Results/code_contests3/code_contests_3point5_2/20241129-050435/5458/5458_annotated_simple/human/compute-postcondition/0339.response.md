Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the computation. If `j + 1` is greater than `k`, then `s` becomes greater than the current value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `s` are updated integers and if `j + 1` > `k`, `s` is greater than the current value of `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k`, `s` are updated integers and if `j + 1` > `k`, `s` is greater than the current value of `k`**
