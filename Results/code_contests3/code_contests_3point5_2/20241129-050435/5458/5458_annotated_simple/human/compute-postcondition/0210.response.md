According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. At the end of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is now 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s` are integers, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, `k` remains an integer, `dp` is determined by the loop conditions for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
