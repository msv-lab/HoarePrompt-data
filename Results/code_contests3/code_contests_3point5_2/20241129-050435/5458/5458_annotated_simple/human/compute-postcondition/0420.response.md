According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` are in the range from 1 to `m`, and `k` and `s` are updated integers. So for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `j` are in the range from 1 to `m`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
