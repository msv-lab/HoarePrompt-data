According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `n`. Since `s` is used as the upper limit for the loop and it starts from 1, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is 0 and `s` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`dp` at index [n is assigned the mapped integer value of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
