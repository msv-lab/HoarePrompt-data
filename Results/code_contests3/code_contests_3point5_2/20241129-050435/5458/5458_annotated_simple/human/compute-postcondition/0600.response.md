According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s > 0`, `j < m` remain the same, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition provided in the else part.**
