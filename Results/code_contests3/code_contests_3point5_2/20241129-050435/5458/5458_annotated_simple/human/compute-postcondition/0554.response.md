According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` are equal to `m + 1`, `k`, `s`, which suggests that the loop can execute. However, to ensure the loop executes the first time, we need to adjust the states to: `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
