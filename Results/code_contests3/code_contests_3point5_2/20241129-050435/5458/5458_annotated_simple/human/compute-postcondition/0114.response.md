Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are greater than or equal to 1. `s` is at least 1. `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 after the execution of the if else block.***
