Postcondition: ***At the end of the if else block, `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is not executed.***
