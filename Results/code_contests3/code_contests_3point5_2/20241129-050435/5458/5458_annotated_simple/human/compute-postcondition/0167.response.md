Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by assigning the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, `k+1` will be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0, `dp[i & 1][j][k]` will be set to 1 and `j` will be greater than or equal to `k`.***
