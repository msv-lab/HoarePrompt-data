According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `k`, `s`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and the state of `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:

If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated to 1. 

If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated.

State: **`dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `n` and `i` are updated, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time**
