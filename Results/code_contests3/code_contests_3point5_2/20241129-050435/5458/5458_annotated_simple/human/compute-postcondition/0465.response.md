Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` >= `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its previous value.***
