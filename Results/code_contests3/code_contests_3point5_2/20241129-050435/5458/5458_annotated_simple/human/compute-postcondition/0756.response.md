Example Answer:
The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables. It simply skips the rest of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific values can be determined for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` as the loop is continued without affecting the variables.
Output State: **No specific values can be determined for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
