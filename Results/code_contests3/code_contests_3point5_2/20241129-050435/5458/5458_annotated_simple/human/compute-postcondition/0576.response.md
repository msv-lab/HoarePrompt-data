According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp` is `m + 1`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.
