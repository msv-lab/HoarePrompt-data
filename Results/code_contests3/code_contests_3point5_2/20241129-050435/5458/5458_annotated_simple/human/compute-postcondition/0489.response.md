Output State: **After the if condition, all variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m. If i is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be 1 for all valid values of j and k. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be the result of the modulo operation between dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. Additionally, the if condition (i == 0) is satisfied. In addition, the value of j is greater than or equal to k**
