According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and must still be less than or equal to `s`. Additionally, the loop execution may also depend on `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, and `s` based on the operations in the loop body.

State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations, `j+1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
