Example Answer:
The value at index `i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `i + 1 & 1, j, k` in `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2**
