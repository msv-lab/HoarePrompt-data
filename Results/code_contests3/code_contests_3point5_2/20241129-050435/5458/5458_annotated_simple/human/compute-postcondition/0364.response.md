Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i` equals 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` after the execution.***
