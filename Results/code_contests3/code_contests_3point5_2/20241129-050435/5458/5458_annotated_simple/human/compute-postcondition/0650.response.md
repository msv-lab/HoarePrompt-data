Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp` at index `1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `1`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and the value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` if `j > k`, and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` value.***
