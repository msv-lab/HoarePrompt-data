According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`. `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then the variables remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` after the execution.**
