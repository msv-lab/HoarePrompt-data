Example Answer:
The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is evaluated and the result is added to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: No variables are affected and the program continues execution.
Output State: **No variables are affected and the program continues execution**
