According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j+1`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `j+1` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j+1` is updated, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are also updated integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. So, for the next iteration, `j+1` should be adjusted accordingly.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1+1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
