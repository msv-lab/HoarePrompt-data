Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0. If `i` is 0, the `dp` array is updated with `1` at index `i + 1 & 1` for `j + 1` and `k` if `j >= k`. If `i` is not 0, and `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
