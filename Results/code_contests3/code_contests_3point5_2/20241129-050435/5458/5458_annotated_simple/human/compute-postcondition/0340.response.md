Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is increased by 1 and if `j + 1` is greater than `k`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`.***
