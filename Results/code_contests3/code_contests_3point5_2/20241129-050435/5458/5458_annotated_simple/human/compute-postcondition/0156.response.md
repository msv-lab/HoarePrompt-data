According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integer values with the condition specified. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integer values. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i & 1][j][k]` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` after the execution of the else part, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.**
