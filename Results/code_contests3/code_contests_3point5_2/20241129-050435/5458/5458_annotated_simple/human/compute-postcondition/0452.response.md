According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`. Since the loop will execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be updated to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` will be `m + 1`**
