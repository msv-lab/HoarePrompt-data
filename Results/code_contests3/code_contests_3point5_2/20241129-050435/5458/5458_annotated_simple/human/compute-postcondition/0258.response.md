Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since all the variables are integers and the value assigned is a constant 1, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
