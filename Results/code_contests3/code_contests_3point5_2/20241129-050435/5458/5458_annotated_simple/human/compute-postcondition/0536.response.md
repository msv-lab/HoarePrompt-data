Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program retains the same state as before the if else block execution.***
