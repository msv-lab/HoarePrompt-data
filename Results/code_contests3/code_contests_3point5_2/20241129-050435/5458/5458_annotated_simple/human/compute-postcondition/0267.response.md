Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. The variables i, j, and k are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers. k + 1 is less than or equal to s + 2. If i == 0 and j >= k + 1, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1] is set to 1. If i == 0 and j > k + 1, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.
