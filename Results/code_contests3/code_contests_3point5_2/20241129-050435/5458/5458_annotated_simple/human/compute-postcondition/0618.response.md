Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s` are integers greater than 0. The final values of the variables depend on the conditions inside the loop, with certain values being assigned based on the conditions met during each iteration. The values of `dp` at the end will be determined by the final iteration of the loop, where all conditions have been evaluated.**
