Postcondition: ***`dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0, then after entering the if condition, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, when `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
