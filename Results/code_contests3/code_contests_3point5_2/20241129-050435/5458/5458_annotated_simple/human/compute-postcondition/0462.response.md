Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` will be `m + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`. Also, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
