Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is updated for the next iteration, but the previous values of `j` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s+1` are updated for the next iteration to execute the loop one more time.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s+1` are updated for the next iteration to execute the loop one more time**
