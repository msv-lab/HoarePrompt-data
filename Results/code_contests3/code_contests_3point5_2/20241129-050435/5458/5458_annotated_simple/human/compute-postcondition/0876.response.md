Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` are updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m` based on conditions met during the loop execution. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is checked against `k`. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `s`, `dp`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` are all updated variables. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues execution with the updated values of `s`, `dp`, `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
