Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` are updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m` based on conditions met during the loop execution, `i` is equal to 1. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
