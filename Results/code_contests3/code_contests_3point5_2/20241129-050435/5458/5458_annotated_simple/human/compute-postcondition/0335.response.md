Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated integers, so their values are already set. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated integers, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated integers, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value of `k`**
