According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1.**
