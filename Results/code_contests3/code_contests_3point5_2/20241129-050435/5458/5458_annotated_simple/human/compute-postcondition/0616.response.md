Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`**
