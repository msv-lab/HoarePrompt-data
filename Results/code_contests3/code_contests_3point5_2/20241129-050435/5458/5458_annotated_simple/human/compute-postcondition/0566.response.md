Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, greater than or equal to 1 respectively. `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. If `i` is not 0, then the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` may or may not change based on the conditions mentioned.***
