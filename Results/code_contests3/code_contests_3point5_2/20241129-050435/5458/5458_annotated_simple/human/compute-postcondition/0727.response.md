Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`. `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1. `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. Depending on the conditions within the loop, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated accordingly, with modulo operations applied whenever necessary.**
