Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is set according to the current iteration of the loop. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. After executing the if statement with the condition `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`***
