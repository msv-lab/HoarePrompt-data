Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros based on the updated values of `n` and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
