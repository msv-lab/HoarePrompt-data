Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers within their specified ranges. For the loop to execute, `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros based on the updated values of `n` and `m`, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
