Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` becomes 1. `j` is greater than or equal to 1, so `j + 1` is at least 2. `k` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is 1**
