Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. After running the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
