Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `j` is greater than `k**.
