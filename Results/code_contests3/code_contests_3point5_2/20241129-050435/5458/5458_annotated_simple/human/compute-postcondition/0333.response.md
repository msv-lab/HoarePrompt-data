Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i, j, and k are updated integers, their values are known. The expression i + 1 & 1 evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the value of i. Therefore, the Output State is: dp, n, m, j, and k are updated integers, s is updated to a value greater than the current value of k.
Output State: **dp, n, m, j, and k are updated integers, s is updated to a value greater than the current value of k**
