Postcondition: ***At the end of the if-else block, the program will have `dp` at index `n + 2` with a mapped integer value, `n` updated to the next value, `i` updated to the next value, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` equal to 1, `s` being at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` equal to 0, `j` being greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` assigned the value of 1.***
