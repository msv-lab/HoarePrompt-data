According to the code snippet, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` is updated according to the logic of the code snippet does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.
State: **`dp` is updated according to the logic of the code snippet, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1 and `j` is 1**
