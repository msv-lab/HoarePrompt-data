Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial states are as follows: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. After execution, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
