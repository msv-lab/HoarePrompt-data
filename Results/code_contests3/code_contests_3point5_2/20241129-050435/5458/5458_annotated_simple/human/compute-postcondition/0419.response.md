According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, the variables that need to be adjusted are `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`.

State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k`, and `s` are updated integers after all iterations of the loop**
