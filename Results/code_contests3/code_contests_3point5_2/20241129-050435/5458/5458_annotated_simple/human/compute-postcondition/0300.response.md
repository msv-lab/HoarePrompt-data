Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The variables `N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j` are all equal to `s`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are all equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are all equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
