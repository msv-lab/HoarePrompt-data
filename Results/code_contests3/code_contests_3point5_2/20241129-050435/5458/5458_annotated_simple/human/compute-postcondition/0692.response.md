Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is the next value in the range from 1 to `s`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 when `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
