Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block of code when j > k.***
