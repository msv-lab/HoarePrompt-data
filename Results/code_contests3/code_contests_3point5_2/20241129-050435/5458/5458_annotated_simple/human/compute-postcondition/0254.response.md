Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. The loop will execute with j incremented by 1, k incremented by 2, k less than or equal to s + 2, i not equal to 0, and the condition (j > k) being true. The new value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is the modulo of the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by mod.**
