According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 but still be within the range of 1 to `m`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
