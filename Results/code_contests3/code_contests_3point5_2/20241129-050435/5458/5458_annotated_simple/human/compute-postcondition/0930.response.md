Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the final values of `dp` at various indices will be updated with mapped integer values based on the conditions within the loop. `n` and `i` will be updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` will remain greater than 0, `s` will be at least 1. `j` will range from 1 to `m`, and `k` will range from 1 to `s`. The specific values of `dp` will be determined by the conditions met during the loop execution.**
