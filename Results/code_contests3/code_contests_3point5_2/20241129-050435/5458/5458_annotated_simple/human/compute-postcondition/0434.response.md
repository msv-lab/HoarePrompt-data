Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`, `j + 1` remains the same, and `k` is already 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly provided, so the output state is: All variables are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1.
Output State: **All variables are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1**
