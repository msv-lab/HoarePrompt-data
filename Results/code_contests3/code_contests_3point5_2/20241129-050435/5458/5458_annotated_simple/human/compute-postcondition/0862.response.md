Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp` will be updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` will be updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` will remain greater than 0, `s` will be at least 1, `j` will range from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, and `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The final values of the variables will depend on the specific conditions met during the loop execution, as described in the loop code.**
