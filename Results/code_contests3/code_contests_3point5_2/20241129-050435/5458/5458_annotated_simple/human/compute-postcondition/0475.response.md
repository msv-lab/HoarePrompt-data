According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than `s + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is currently at its maximum value which is `s`, and `s` is the upper limit for the loop. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s` and it can be achieved by decreasing the value of `k` by 1.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `k` is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1**
