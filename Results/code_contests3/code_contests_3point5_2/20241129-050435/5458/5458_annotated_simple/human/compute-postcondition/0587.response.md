According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` remain the same. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is now 1, `s` is greater than 0, and `j` is less than `m`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` remain the same, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
