Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input received from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within a specific range, so after execution, `n`, `m`, and `s` will hold those integer values. The value of `mod` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within their specified ranges, `mod` is assigned the value 100000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within their specified ranges, `mod` is assigned the value 100000**
