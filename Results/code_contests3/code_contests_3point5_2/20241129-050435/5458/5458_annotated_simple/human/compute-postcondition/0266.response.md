According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than `s + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers. k + 1 is less than or equal to s + 2. If i == 0 and j >= k + 1, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1] is set to 1. If i == 0 and j > k + 1, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]**
