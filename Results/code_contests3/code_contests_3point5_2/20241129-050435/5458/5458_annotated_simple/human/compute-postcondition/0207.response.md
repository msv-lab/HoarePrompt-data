Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. The values of `s` and `k` are retained as they are at the end of the loop. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, the values of `i+1`, `j+1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated accordingly. The final state will be determined by the last iteration of the loop.**
