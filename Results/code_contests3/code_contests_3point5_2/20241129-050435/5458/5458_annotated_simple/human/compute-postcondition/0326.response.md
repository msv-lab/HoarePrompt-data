Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly given, but based on the code snippet, the updated state can be inferred.
Output State: **`dp` is updated, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
