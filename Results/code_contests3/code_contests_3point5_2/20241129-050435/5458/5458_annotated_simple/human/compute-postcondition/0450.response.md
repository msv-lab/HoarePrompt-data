Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then the variables remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` after the execution. If `i` is 0, the variables remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
