Postcondition: ***All variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m, k is now one less than its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time k must be less than s + 1. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod***
