Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
