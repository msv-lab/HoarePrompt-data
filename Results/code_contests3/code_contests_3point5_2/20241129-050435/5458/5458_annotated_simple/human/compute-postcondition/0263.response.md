Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i, j, k, mod` are involved in the calculation, and their previous values are known. Therefore, the Output State is: *N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration. The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on the calculation mentioned.
