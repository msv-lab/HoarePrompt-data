Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated according to loop operations. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations to satisfy the conditions for the next iteration.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations to satisfy the conditions for the next iteration**
