According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than `s+1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s+1`. So for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s+1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 after the execution of the if else block. No variables are affected if the else block is executed. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than `s+1`**
