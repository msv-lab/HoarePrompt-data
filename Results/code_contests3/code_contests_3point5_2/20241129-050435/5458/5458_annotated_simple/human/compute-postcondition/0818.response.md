According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2 and `k` is equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must remain greater than or equal to 2 and `k` must be updated to the next value less than or equal to `s`.
State: **At the end of the if-else block, the program will have `dp` at index `n + 2` with a mapped integer value, `n` updated to the next value, `i` updated to the next value, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` updated to the next value less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute the second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
