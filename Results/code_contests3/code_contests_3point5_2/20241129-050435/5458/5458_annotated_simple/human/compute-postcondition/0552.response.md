Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Depending on the conditions within the loop, the values of `dp` will be updated and calculated accordingly.**
