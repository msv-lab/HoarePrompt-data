Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1 as per the conditions given. The value of `k` remains 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers where `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 and `i`, `j`, `k` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
