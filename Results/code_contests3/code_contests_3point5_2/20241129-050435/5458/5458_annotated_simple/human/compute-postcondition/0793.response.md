Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp` at index `n + 3` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
