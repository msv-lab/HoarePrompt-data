According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m` are greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 after the execution of the if else block. No variables are affected if the else block is executed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be less than `s+1`.
