Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment, but their previous values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
