According to the code, the loop can execute n^2 times. At the end of the last iteration, the variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` will be updated integers. To execute the loop one more time, the updated values of these variables should be considered. 

State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are the updated integers after all iterations of the loop.**
