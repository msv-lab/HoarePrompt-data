According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 to move to the next value in the range. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **At the end of the iteration, `k` is incremented by 1, if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
