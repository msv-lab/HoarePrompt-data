Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `n` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
