According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that k is now k+1.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
