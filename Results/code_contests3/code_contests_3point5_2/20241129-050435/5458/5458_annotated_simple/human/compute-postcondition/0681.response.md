Example Answer:
The value at index `n + 1` of `dp` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. After the execution of the code, the updated state will be reflected in the `dp` array.
Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is updated based on the calculation, other variables remain the same as before**
