Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` are integers. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `(i == 0)` is false and `j >= k`, then `i` is updated to `i+1`, `j` is updated to `j+1`, and `k` remains 1 for the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise it remains unchanged if `i == 0`. If `i` is not 0, `j` is increased by 1, `k` remains 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Additionally, if `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
