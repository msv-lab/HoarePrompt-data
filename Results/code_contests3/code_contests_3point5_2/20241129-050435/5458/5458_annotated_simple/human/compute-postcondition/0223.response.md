Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. j is 1, k remains an integer. dp is determined by the loop conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, m is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1. If i == 0, then j is updated to be greater than or equal to k and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of 1. If i != 0, and j is greater than k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the remainder of the division of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] by mod.***
