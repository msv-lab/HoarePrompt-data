Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the next time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 0. If `j >= k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `j > k`, the if statement is executed, otherwise there is no change in the program state.***
