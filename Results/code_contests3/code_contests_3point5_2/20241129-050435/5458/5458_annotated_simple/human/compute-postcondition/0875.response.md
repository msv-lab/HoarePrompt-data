Output State: **`s`, `dp`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k` are all updated variables. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues execution with the updated values of `s`, `dp`, `n`, `i`, `m`, and `j. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
