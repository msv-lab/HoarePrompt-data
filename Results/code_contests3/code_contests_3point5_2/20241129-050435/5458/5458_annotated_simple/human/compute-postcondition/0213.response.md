Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is 1, `k` remains an integer. `dp` is determined by the loop conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. After the if condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
