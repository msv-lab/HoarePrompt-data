According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`dp` is updated, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
