Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then after the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` remain within the range of 1 to `m` without any modifications.***
