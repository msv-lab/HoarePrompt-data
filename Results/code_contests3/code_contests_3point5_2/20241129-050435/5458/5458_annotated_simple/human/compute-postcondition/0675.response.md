According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, and `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute again `k` should be incremented to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`.
