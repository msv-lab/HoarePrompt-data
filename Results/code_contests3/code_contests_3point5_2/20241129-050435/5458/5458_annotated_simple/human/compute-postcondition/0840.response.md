Postcondition: ***`dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The condition (i == 0) is false. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if block.***
