According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m + 1`.
State: **At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than `m + 1**.
