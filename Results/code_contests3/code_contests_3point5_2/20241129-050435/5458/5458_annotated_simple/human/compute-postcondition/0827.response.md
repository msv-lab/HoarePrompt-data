Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, the program will have `dp` at index `n + 2` with a mapped integer value, `n` updated to the next value, `i` updated to the next value, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` remaining at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 2`, and the final values of `dp` will be determined by the conditions inside the loop for each `i`, `j`, and `k` combination.**
