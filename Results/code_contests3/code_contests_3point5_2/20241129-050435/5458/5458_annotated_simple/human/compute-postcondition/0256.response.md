Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers. j is 1, k is incremented by 2, k is less than or equal to s + 2. For the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is incremented by 2. If i == 0, then if j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, j and k are incremented by 1 and 2 respectively. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the modulo operation.***
