Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1.
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s + 1**
