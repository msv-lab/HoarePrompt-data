Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within their specified ranges, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros based on the updated values of `n` and `m`, `s` is greater than 0. When the if condition (i == 0) is true and (j >= k) is true, the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
