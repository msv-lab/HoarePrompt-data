You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time students_list is a list of students with at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is within the range of 1 to m. At the end of the last iteration, all variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m. If i is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be 1 for all valid values of j and k. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be the result of the modulo operation between dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **After all iterations, all variables dp, n, m, i, j, k, s are within the range of 1 to m. If i is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be 1 for all valid values of j and k. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be the result of the modulo operation between dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. For the loop to execute one more time, the values of j need to be adjusted accordingly.
```
for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?
