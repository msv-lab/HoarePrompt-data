Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The previous values of the variables are as follows: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers; j is 1, k remains an integer. The condition i is not equal to 0 is true, and j is greater than k. After execution, the output state is: At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers; j is 1, k remains an integer, dp is determined by the loop conditions.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k are integers; j is 1, k remains an integer, dp is determined by the loop conditions.**
