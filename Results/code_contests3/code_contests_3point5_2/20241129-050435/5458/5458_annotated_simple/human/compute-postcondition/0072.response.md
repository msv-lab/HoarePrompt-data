Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j >= k`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
