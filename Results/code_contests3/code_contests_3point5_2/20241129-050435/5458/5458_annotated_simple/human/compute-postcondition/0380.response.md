Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `j+1+1` is adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
