Postcondition: ***`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, and the value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0, then the assignment takes place as described. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
