Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` is 0, the new value of `i` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `k`, and all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is updated, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
