According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are all equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, and greater than or equal to 1 respectively. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop is iterating over `k`, we need to increment the value of `k` by 1.
- If `i` is 0, then no specific changes are required as it depends on the condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `i` is not 0, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` may or may not change based on the conditions mentioned.

State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**.
