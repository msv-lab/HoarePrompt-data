According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k`, `s` have been determined by the logic of the loop and the initial conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
