Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range from 1 to `m`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1**
