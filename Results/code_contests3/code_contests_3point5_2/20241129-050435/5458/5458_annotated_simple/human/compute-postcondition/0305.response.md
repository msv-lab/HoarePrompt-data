Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since all variables are initially equal to `s`, after executing the code, the state remains the same except for the modification of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j, k` are all equal to `s`. If `j > k`, `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
