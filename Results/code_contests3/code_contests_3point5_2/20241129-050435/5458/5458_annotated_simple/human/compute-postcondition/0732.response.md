Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1. Additionally, when the if condition `(i == 0)` is met, the program state is as follows: `i` is equal to 0. At this point, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
