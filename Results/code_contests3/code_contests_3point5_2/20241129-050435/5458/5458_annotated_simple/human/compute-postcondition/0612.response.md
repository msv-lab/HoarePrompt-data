Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, but based on the given initial state, all variables are integers greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0 and `j` is less than `m`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0 and `j` is less than `m`**
