According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s` and incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`.**
