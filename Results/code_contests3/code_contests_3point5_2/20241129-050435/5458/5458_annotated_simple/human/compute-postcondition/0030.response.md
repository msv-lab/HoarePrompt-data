Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, `k` is incremented by 1. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` have been updated according to the given calculations.***
