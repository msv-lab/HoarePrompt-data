According to the loop code, the loop can execute as long as `j` ranges from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at `m + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, the next iteration should have `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. 
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp` will be updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` will be updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` will remain greater than 0, `s` will be at least 1, `j` will range from 1 to `m` based on conditions met during the loop execution**
