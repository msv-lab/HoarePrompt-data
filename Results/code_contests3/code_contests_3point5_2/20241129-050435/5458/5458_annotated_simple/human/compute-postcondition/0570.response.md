Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial values of the variables are `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the calculation involves `i + 1` and `j + 1`, the values of these variables are incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are equal to `m + 1`, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
