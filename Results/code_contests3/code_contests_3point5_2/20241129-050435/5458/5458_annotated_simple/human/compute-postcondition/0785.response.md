According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, `i`, and the condition `i == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, and `dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
1. `k` should be updated to 2.
2. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1. 
3. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, for the loop to execute the third time `k` is 2**.
