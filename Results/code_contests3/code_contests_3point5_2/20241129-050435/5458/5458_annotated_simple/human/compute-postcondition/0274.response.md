Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers. k + 1 is less than or equal to s + 2. If i == 0 and j >= k + 1, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1] is set to 1. If i == 0 and j > k + 1, the program continues to the next iteration with the updated value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]. If i != 0, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
