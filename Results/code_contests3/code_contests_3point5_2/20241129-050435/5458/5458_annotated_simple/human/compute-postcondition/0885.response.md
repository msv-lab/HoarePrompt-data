Postcondition: ***`s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` are updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remains greater than 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m` based on conditions met during the loop execution, `k` is now incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the specified updates. Otherwise, `s`, `dp`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k` retain their updated values from the loop execution.***
