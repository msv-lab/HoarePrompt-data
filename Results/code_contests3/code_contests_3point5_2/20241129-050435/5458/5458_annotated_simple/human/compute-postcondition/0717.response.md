According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, and the conditions within the loop body. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` at index `n + 1` is updated, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, and `k` is set according to the current iteration of the loop. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- Update `k` to be the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.
- Make sure the conditions specified in the code snippet are satisfied for the next iteration.

State: **At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`. `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is set to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`.**
