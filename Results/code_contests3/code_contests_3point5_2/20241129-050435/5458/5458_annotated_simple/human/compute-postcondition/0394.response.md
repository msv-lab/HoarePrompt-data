Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are updated according to loop operations, `j+1` is still less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any change in variable values. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
