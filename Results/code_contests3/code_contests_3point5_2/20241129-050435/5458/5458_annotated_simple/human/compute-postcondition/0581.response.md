Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` are integers. `dp` is `m + 1`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or block of code.***
