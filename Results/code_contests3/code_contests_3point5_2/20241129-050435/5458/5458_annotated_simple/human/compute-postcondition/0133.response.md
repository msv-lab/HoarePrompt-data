Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 after the execution of the if block. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than `s+1`**
