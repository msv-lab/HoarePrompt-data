Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are used in the assignment but their initial values are not provided, so the output state is: N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j + 1, k + 2 are integers. k is less than or equal to s + 2**
