Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `k` remain integers. If `(i == 0)` is false and `j >= k`, then `i` is updated to `i+1`, `j` is updated to `j+1`, and `k` remains 1 for the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
