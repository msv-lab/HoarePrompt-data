Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and the value of `i` is not 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition where `j > k`, the program state is such that `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
