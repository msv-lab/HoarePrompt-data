Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`. `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is set to the next value in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, and `dp` at index `i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j >= k`.***
