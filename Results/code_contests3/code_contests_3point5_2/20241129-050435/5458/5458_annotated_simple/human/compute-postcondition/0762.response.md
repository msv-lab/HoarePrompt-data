According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` at index `n + 1` was assigned a value, `m` and `s` were used in the loop, `n` was updated to the next value, `i` was updated to the next value, `m` was greater than 0, `s` was at least 1, and `j` was in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` should be increased by 1 within the range of 1 to `m + 1`.
State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` will be assigned a mapped integer value, `n` will be updated to the next value, `i` will be updated to the next value, `m` will remain greater than 0, `s` will remain at least 1, `j` will be in the range from 1 to `m + 2**.
