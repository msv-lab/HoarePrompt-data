Example Answer:
The value at index `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, `k` in the `dp` array is assigned the value at index `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, `k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, so the new indices are calculated accordingly. The state of other variables remains the same.
Output State: **`dp` is updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` incremented by 1, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`, `i` less than `n`, `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
