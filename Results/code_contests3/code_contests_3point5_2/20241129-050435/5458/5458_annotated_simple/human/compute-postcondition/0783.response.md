Output State: **`dp` at index `n + 2` is assigned a mapped integer value, `n` is updated to the next value, `i` is updated to the next value, `m` remains greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 2`, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
