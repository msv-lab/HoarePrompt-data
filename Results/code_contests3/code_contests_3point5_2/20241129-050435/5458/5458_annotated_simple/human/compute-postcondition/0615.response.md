Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is likely dependent on previous calculations and is unknown from the given initial state. Since no other variables are affected and there are no conditional statements, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then there is no change in the variables and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+2`, `s+1 > k > s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then there is no change in the variables and the program continues to the next iteration or statement**
