According to the code, the loop will execute s times. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of k must be less than or equal to s. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that k is now s.
State: **N, M, S, mod, m, s, i, j+1, k is s, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than or equal to m**
