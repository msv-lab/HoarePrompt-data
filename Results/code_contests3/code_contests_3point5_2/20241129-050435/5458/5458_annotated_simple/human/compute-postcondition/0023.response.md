Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, but `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
