According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` is assigned the value of `s`, so `k` needs to be adjusted to be in the range from 1 to `s`. Additionally, `j` should be adjusted to be equal to `s` as it is greater than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, `j` is equal to `s`.
State: **`dp` at index `n + 1` is assigned the mapped integer value of `n + 1`, `m`, and `s`, `n` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s`, `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute**
