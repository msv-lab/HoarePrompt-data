Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `s` until all three are 0. It then performs a series of calculations using dynamic programming to update values in a multidimensional array `dp`. The final result is printed based on the updated values in `dp`. The function does not have a specific return value and operates within the constraints provided for `n`, `m`, and `s`.**
