According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s+1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers. If `i` is 0, after the if else block executes, `dp[i & 1][j][k]` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. `k+1` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
