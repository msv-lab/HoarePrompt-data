Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, `s` remain the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented by 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` have been updated according to the given calculations.**
