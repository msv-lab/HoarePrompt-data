Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `dp`, and `s` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If the condition (j >= k) is met, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the new value assigned is 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
