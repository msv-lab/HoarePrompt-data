Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k=s+1`, `s` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
