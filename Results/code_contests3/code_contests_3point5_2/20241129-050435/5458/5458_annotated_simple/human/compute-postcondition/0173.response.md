Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers. If `i` is 0, after the if else block executes, `dp[i & 1][j][k]` is set to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Additionally, `k+1` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
