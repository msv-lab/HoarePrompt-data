According to the code, for the loop to execute, `k` must range from 1 to `s + 1`. `s` must be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, and `j` should remain in the specified conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

State: **`dp` updated at various indices with mapped integer values, `n` and `i` updated to the next values after the loop finishes, `m` remaining greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `j` ranging from 1 to `m + 1` based on conditions met during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n`, `k` should be in the range from 1 to `s + 1`**
