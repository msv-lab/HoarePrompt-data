According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `s` is not an empty string. Additionally, since `memo` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution but should be mentioned in the state for completeness. 
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
