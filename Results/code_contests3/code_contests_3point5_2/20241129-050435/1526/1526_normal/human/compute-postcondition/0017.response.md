According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the memo dictionary. If memo has at least one value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the memo dictionary needs to have at least one value. So, for the loop to execute the first time, one of the values in memo should be greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s, result is True, for the loop to execute the first time at least one value in memo is greater than or equal to 1**
