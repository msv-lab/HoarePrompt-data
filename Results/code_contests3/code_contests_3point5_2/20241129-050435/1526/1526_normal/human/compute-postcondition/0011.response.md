According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, and `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`. The character `c` has been processed in the last iteration and `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`, `memo[d]` is 0 if `d` is not already in `memo` where `memo[d]` has been incremented by 1**
