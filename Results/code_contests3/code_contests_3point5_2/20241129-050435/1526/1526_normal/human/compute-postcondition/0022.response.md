According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values in the memo dictionary. If there is at least one value in memo that is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s. Result is True. For the loop to execute the first time, at least one value in memo is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- Check if any value in memo is greater than or equal to 1.
- If x % 2 is greater than 0, then result is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s. Result is True, for the loop to execute a second time, at least one value in memo is greater than or equal to 1**
