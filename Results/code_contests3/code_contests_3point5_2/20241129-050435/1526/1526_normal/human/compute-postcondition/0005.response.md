Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary. If `c` is not a key in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `w`, `s`, and `memo` after the execution of the if else block.***
