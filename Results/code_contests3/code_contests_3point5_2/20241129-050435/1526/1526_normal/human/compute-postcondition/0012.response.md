Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 0 to `memo[c]`, where `c` is a character. Since `memo[d]` is 0 if `d` is not already in `memo`, this implies that `c` is not in `memo` before this assignment. Therefore, after execution, `memo[c]` is set to 0, and the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`, `memo[d]` is 0 if `d` is not already in `memo` where `memo[d]` has been incremented by 1, `memo[c]` is 0**
