Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`, and `memo[c]` is 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`, `memo[c]` is 0**
