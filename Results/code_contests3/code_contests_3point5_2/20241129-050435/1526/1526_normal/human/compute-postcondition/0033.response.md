Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads a string `s` from input, creates a dictionary `memo` where keys are unique characters in `s` and values are the frequency of those characters. It then checks if the frequency of any character in `memo` is odd. If there is at least one odd frequency, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates independently of input values.**
