Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, and 'No' if `result` is False. The value of `result` is initially set to False if there is at least one value in `memo` that is odd, otherwise it is set to True. The initial state is `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in `s`, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `result` is determined based on the values in `memo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in `s`, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `result` is either True or False based on the values in `memo`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in `s`, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `result` is either True or False based on the values in `memo`**
