Example Answer:
The value of memo[c] is incremented by 1. If c is not in memo, memo[c] is initially 0. After execution, memo[c] will be incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, memo is updated based on the characters in s, memo[d] is 0 if d is not already in memo where memo[d] has been incremented by 1. If c is not in memo, memo[c] is 1.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, memo is updated based on the characters in s, memo[d] is 0 if d is not already in memo where memo[d] has been incremented by 1. If c is not in memo, memo[c] is 1**
