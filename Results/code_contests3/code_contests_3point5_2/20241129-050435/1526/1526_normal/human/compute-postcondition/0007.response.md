According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the dictionary `memo`. If there are more characters in `s` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and the dictionary `memo` has been updated based on the characters in `s`. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more character in `s` that has not been iterated over.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`**
