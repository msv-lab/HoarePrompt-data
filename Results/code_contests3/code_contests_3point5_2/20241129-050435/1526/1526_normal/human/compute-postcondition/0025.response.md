Postcondition: ***w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s. Result is True, for the loop to execute a second time, at least one value in memo is greater than or equal to 1. If x % 2 is greater than 0, then the result is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
