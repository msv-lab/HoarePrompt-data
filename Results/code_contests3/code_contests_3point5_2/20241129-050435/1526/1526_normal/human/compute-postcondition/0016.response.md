Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s. result is True.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary where each key represents a unique character in s, and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character in s. result is True**
