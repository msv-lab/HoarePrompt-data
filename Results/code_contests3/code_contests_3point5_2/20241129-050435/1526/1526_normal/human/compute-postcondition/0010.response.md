Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is initialized to 0 before the increment operation. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is updated based on the characters in `s`, `memo[c]` is 0 if `c` is not already in `memo` where `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1.**
