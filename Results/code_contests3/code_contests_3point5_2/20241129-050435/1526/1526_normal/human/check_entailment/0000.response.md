Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string `s` from the input, creates a dictionary `memo` where keys are unique characters in `s` and values are the frequency of those characters. It then checks if the frequency of any character in `memo` is odd. If there is at least one odd frequency, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the code works.
