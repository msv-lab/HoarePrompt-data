Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines if a given string `w` is beautiful by checking if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times. It achieves this by creating a dictionary `memo` to store the count of each character in the input string `s`, and then iterating through the values of the dictionary to check if each count is even. If any count is odd, it sets the result to False. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True (all counts are even) and 'No' otherwise.

The program always follows the problem description as it checks for the specific condition of having each lowercase letter occur an even number of times. It correctly outputs 'Yes' for beautiful strings and 'No' for non-beautiful strings.
