The function `func_1` reads a string input `s`, creates a dictionary `memo` where each unique character in `s` is a key with the corresponding count of occurrences, and then checks if all counts of characters in `memo` are even. It prints 'Yes' if all counts are even, otherwise 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
