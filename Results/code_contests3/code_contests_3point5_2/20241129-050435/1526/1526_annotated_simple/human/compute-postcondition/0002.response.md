According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in string s. Therefore, for the loop to execute, s must not be empty. Additionally, the loop does not directly depend on the variables w and memo, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is an empty dictionary**
