Example Answer:
The key `c` is added to the `memo` dictionary with the value 0. The variables `w`, `s`, and the values of other keys in the `memo` dictionary are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary with the key c having a value of 0.
Output State: ***w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary with the key c having a value of 0***
