Example Answer:
The code snippet increments the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo` by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, it adds `c` to the dictionary with an initial value of 0 before incrementing it by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters, s is a non-empty string, memo is a dictionary with the key c having a value of 1**
