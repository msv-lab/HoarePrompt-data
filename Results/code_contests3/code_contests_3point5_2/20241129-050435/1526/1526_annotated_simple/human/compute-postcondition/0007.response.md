According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute another time, there must be more characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the string `s` needs to be accessed. Therefore, the string `s` should still contain more characters to iterate over.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1**
