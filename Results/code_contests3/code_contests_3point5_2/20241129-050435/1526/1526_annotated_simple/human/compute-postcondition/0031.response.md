Example Answer:
The code prints 'Yes' if result is True, and 'No' if result is False. The value of result is determined based on whether all values in memo are even. If all values in memo are even, result is True; otherwise, result is False. The initial state includes variables w, s, memo, and result. The output state will depend on whether all values in memo are even or not.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is True if all values in `memo` are even, and False otherwise.**
