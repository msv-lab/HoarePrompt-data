Example Answer: 
The value of `memo[c]` is assigned 0, where `c` is a key in the `memo` dictionary with a value of 1. After execution, the value of `memo[c]` is updated to 0. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 0**
