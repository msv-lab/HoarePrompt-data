According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary is not empty and has at least one value, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed, the dictionary `memo` must not be empty and contain at least one value, and `x` should be the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `memo` is not empty and contains at least one value, `x` is the first value in the dictionary**
