Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is either True or False. If x % 2 > 0, `result` is False and we exit the most internal loop or if statement in the program.***
