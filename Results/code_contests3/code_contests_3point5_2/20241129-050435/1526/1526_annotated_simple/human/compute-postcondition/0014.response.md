Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If the key `c` exists in `memo`, its value will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, the key `c` will be added to `memo` with a value of 1. The initial value of `memo` is {c: 2}, so after execution, the value of `memo[c]` will be 3.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 3**
