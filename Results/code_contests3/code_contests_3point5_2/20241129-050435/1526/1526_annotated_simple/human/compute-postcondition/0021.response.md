Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is either True or False, for the loop to execute the first time `memo` is not empty and contains at least one value, `x` is the first value in the dictionary. If the first value in the dictionary is odd, then `result` is False, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
