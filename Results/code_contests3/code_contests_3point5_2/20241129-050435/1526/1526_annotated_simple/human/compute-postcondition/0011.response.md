According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters left in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 2. Since `c` is in the dictionary `memo`, the value of `c` remains 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the string `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 2**.
