Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The key `c` in the dictionary `memo` had a value of `2`, but now it is updated to `0`. The other variables `w` and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of `0`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of `0`**
