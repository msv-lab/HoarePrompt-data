Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which reads a string of input. The initial state does not mention any variable named `raw_input()`, so it can be assumed that `s` will contain the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters; s is a string input.
Output State: **w is a string consisting of lowercase letters; s is a string input**
