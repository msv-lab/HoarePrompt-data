Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the boolean value True. The states of the other variables `w`, `s`, and `memo` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is True**
