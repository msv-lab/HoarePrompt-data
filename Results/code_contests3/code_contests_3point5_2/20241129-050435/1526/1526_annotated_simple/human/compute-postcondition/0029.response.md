Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the value corresponding to the number of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is not False. If x % 2 > 0, `w`, `s`, `memo`, and `result` retain their initial values, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
