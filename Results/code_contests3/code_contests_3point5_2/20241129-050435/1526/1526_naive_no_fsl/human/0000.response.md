Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines if a string is beautiful based on the problem description. It counts the occurrences of each letter in the input string and then checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If any letter occurs an odd number of times, the program sets the result to False. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' otherwise. The program handles all potential cases where the input string may or may not be beautiful, as specified in the problem description.
