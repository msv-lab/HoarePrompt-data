Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string, counts the occurrences of each character, and then checks if each character occurs an even number of times. If any character occurs an odd number of times, it sets the result to False. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True, indicating that the string is beautiful, and 'No' otherwise. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases.
