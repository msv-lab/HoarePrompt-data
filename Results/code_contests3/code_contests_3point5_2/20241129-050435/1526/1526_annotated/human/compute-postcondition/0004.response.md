Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, where `c` is not present in the `memo` dictionary. Therefore, a new key-value pair `c: 0` is added to the `memo` dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string, `memo` dictionary contains the key-value pair `c: 0`**
