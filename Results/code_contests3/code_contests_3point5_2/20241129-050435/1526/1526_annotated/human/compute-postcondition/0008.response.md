Example Answer:
The dictionary `memo` is updated with the key `c` and the value 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value 0**
