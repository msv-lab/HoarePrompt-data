Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user as a string. The initial state mentions that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`), but it does not specify if `raw_input()` is also a lowercase string. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`), `s` is an input string.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`), `s` is an input string**
