Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute `memo` is not empty. If `x % 2 > 0`, then `result` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
