According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters left in the string to process, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value incremented by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` should still have more characters left to process. So, for the next iteration, the state should be as follows:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value incremented by 1**
