Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value, `result` is True**
