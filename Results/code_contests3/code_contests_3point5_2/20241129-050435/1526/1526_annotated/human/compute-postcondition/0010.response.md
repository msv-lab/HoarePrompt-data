Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not already present in `memo`, it will be added with a value of 0 before incrementing. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value incremented by 1.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value incremented by 1**
