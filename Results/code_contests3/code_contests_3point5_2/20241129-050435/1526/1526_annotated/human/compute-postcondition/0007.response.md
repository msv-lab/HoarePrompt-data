According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the input string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string, and `memo` is a dictionary that may or may not have the key `c`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then the key-value pair `c: 0` is added to `memo`, and the value associated with key `c` is incremented by 1 after the loop iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the input string `s` needs to be processed. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character to process, `memo` is a dictionary**.
