According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` being a non-empty input string with all characters processed, and `result` being True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `memo` is not empty.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute `memo` is not empty**
