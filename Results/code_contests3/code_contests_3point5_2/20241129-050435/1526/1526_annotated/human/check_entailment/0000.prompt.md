You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let w be a string consisting of lowercase letters. We will call w beautiful if the following condition is satisfied:

* Each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs even number of times in w.



You are given the string w. Determine if w is beautiful.

Constraints

* 1 \leq |w| \leq 100
* w consists of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


w


Output

Print `Yes` if w is beautiful. Print `No` otherwise.

Examples

Input

abaccaba


Output

Yes


Input

hthth


Output

No
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`).
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        
        memo[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value.
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters `a-z`, `s` is a non-empty input string with all characters processed, `memo` is a dictionary with each unique character in `s` as a key and the frequency of that character as the value, `result` is True. If there is at least one value in `memo` that is an odd number, `result` will be False. Otherwise, it will remain True after the loop executes.
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an input string `s`, processes each character to calculate its frequency, and checks if all character frequencies are even. It then prints 'Yes' if all frequencies are even, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
