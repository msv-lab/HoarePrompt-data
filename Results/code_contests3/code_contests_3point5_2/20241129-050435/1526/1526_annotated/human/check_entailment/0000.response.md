Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an input string `s`, calculates the frequency of each character in the string, and then checks if all character frequencies are even. If there is at least one character with an odd frequency, it sets `result` to False. Otherwise, it keeps `result` as True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, indicating that the string is beautiful, and 'No' otherwise.

The program covers all cases as it correctly determines if a given string is beautiful based on the frequency of each character in the string. Therefore, it follows the problem description for every potential case.
