Correctness: **True**

The program takes two input strings `s` and `t`, then it checks if `s` is equal to `t` after rotation. It iterates through all possible rotations of `t` and checks if any of them is equal to `s`. If it finds a match, it prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`.

The program logic seems correct and covers all possible rotations of `t` to check if it equals `s`. It also meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
