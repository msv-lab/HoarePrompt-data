Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints suggest that the code checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t` and prints 'Yes' if possible, 'No' otherwise. However, the code does not handle the case where both strings are equal but rotated versions of each other. For example, if `s = "abc"` and `t = "bca"`, the code would incorrectly output "No" instead of "Yes". Hence, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem.
