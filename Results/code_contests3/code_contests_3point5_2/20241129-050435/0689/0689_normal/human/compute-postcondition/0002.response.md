Example Answer:
The code checks if there exists any rotation of string `t` that matches string `s`. If such a rotation exists, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The output of the code is dependent on the values of strings `s` and `t`. No other variables are affected in this code. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; s is a string, t is an input string and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the rotation check.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; s is a string, t is an input string and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the rotation check.**
