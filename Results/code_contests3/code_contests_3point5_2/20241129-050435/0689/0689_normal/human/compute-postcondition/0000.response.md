Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input obtained using `raw_input()`. Since the initial state specifies that `S` and `T` are strings, the value of `s` will also be a string. Therefore, the Output State is: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; s is a string**.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|; s is a string**.
