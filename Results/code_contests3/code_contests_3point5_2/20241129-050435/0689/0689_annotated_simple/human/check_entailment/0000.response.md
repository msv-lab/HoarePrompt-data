Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it takes two strings S and T as input, and then checks if string S equals string T after rotation. It does this by checking if any rotation of string T matches string S. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. This is exactly what the problem description asks for, so the program is correct.
