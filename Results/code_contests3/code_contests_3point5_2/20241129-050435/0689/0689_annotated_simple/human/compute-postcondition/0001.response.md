Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which is input by the user. The length of `t` is equal to the length of `s` since |S| = |T|. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is a string input by the user, and `t` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user**
