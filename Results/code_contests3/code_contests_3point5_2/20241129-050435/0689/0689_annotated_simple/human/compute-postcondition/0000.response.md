Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. The lengths of `S` and `T` are the same, so the length of `s` will be the same as the length of `S` and `T`. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of string X; `s` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of string X; `s` is a string input by the user**
