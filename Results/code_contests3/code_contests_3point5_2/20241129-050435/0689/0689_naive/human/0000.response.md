Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes two inputs S and T, and checks if T can be obtained by rotating S. It does this by generating all possible rotations of T and checking if any of them matches S. The logic seems correct as it covers all possible rotations of T and compares them with S. Since the program is checking for all possible cases, it should work correctly for all inputs within the specified constraints.
