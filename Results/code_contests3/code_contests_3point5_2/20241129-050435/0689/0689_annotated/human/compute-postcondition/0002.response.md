Example Answer:
The code checks if there exists a rotation of string `t` such that it equals string `s`. It goes through all possible rotations of `t` and checks if any of them match `s`. If such a rotation exists, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. No variables are changed in this process. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is a string of the same length as S and T, `t` is assigned the input from the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is a string of the same length as S and T, `t` is assigned the input from the user**
