Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of the user input using `raw_input()`. Since the initial state mentions that S and T are strings of lowercase English letters with the same length, and the length is between 2 and 100, the length of the string `s` is within this range. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is a string of the same length as S and T.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is a string of the same length as S and T**
