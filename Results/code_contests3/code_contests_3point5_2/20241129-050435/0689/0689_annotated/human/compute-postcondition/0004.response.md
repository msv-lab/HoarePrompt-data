Functionality: **The function `func` takes two strings `S` and `T` as input, where both strings consist of lowercase English letters and have the same length between 2 and 100. It then checks if string `S` can be obtained by rotating string `T` and returns 'Yes' if it is possible, and 'No' otherwise.**
