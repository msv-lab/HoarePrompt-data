Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two strings `S` and `T` as input, and then checks if `S` equals `T` after rotation. It does this by checking if any rotation of `T` is equal to `S`. If such a rotation exists, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. This matches the problem description provided.
