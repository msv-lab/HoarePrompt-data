According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `b` decremented by 1, and `k` is 1. 
State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
