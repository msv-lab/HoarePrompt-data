Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, where `a` holds the value entered by the user. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`**
