Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of integer division of `i` by `f`. The values of `i` and `f` are dependent on user input and calculation, so the exact value of `d` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `i` and `f`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `i % f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `i % f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
