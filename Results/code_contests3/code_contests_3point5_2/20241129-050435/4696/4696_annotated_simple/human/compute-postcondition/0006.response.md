Example Answer:
The variable `f` is assigned the value of the factorial of `n - k`. The value of `n` is an integer value of `a`, and the value of `k` is 1. Therefore, `f` is assigned the factorial of `a - 1`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`**
