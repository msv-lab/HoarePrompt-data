The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the number of permutations of length n with a maximum possible value of f(p), where f(p) is a function. The constraints on the parameters are that n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn. The function does not return any value, but it performs the calculation based on the constraints provided. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of permutations of length n with a maximum possible value of f(p), where n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn.**
