Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`, where `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are known, so `d` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, the value at index `d` in list `p` is printed, `p` is updated after removing the element at index `d`.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`**
