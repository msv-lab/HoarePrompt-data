Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1.
Output State: **`a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1**
