Example Answer:
The value of `d` is used as an index to print the value of list `p`. The output will be the element at index `d` in list `p`. The values of the other variables are as follows: `a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `i % f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `i % f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. The value at index `d` in list `p` is printed.**
