Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the integer value of `a`. The value of `n` is based on the input provided by the user. The value of `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`**
