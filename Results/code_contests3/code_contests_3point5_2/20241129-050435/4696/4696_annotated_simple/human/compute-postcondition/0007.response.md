Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`. The values of `i` and `f` depend on the initial values of `b` and `a`, so the final value of `d` will depend on those initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`**
