According to the code, the loop can execute another time if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`.
State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, the value at index `d` in list `p` is printed, `p` is updated after removing the element at index `d`.**
