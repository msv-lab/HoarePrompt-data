Functionality: **The function accepts user input values for `n` and `m`, where `m` is decremented by 1. It then calculates the number of permutations of length `n` with a maximum possible value of f(p). The function iterates through a loop, performing factorial calculations, division, printing values, and removing elements from a list `p`. At the end of the loop, `p` becomes an empty list.**
