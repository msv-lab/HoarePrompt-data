Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value `int(b)`, where `b` holds the value entered by the user. The value of `i` is determined by converting `b` to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
