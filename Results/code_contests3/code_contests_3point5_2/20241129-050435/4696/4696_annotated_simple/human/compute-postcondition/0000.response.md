Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. The function `raw_input()` reads a line from input and `split()` splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. Therefore, after execution, `a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user.
Output State: **`a` and `b` hold the values entered by the user**
