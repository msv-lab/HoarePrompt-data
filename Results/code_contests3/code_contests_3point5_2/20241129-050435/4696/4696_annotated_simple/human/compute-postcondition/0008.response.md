Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `i` by `f`, where `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`. The program prints the value at index `d` of list `p`. The output state remains the same for all variables except for the output of the print statement.
Output State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `b`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f`. The program prints the value at index `d` of list `p`.**
