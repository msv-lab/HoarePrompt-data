According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `f`, `d` are as described. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` should be incremented by 1.
- `n` should be greater than or equal to `k`.
- `f` should be the factorial of `a - 1`.
- `d` should be the result of `i` divided by `f`.

State: **`a` holds the value entered by the user, `b` holds the value entered by the user decremented by 1, `n` is an integer value of `a`, `i` is an integer value of `i % f`, `k` is incremented by 1, `f` is the factorial of `a - 1`, `d` is the result of `i` divided by `f` for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
