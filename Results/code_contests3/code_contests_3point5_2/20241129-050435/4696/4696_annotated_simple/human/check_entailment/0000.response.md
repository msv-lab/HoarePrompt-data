Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values of n and m, calculates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p), and outputs the result. The program uses factorials to calculate the position of each element in the permutation and ensures that the output is in lexicographically increasing order.

The program goes through all possible permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) and selects the m-th permutation in lexicographical order, as required by the problem description. It handles all cases within the given constraints and produces the correct output.
