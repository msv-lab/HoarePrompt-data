Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`. Since the values of `n` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input**
