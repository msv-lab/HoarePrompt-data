According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. So in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `n+1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, and the element at index `d` is removed from list `p`. For the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be less than or equal to `n + 1**.
