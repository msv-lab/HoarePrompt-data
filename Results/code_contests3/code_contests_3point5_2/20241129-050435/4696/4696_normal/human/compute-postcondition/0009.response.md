Example Answer:
The code removes the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`, and `p` is a range from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`, and the element at index `d` is removed from list `p`.**
