Example Answer:
`p` is assigned the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. As `n` is a positive integer, `p` will be a range object containing integers from 1 to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n`**
