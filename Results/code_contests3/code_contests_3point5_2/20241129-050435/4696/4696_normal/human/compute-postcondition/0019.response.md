Example Answer: 
`d` is assigned the value of `i` floor divided by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are unknown, so the exact value of `d` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, element at index `d` is removed from list `p`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, element at index `d` is removed from list `p`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
