Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the element at index `d` from list `p`. The value of `p` has already been modified with the removal of the element at index `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
