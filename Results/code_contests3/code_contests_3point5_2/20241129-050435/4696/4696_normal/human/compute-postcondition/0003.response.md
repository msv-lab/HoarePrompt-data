Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is the converted integer value of `b`, so after execution, `i` will be one less than the converted integer value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is one less than the converted integer value of `b`**
