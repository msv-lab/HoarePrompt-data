Example Answer:
The element at index `d` is removed from list `p`. The previous values of the variables are not specified, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `i` is the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
