Example Answer:
The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of `a` which the user inputs. The variables `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input**
