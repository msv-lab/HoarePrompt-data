Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value of `b`, which is taken as an input from the user and converted to an integer. The value of `b` is now stored in `i`. The values of `n`, `a`, and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is assigned the converted integer value of `b`**
