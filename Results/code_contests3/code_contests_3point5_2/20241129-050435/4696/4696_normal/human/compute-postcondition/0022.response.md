Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `i` divided by `f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - k`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the new remainder value, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input, `i` is the new remainder value, `k` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `p` with element at index `d` removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
