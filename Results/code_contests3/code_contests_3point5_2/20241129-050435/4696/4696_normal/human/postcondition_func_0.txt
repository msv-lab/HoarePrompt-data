The function takes user input for integers `n` and `m`, performs calculations on permutations based on the values of `n` and `m`, and outputs the results. It calculates the value of `f(p)` for each permutation `p` and prints the corresponding values based on the given constraints. The function handles permutations, factorials, and index calculations to determine the output.
