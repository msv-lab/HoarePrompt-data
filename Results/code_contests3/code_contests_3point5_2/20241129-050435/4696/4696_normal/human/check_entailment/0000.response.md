Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes input values for integers `n` and `m`, calculates the permutations based on these values, and outputs the required permutation. It iterates through the permutations and calculates the value of `f(p)` for each permutation `p`. The code correctly handles the permutations, factorials, and index calculations to determine the output. 

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given constraints. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Therefore, the code is correct.
