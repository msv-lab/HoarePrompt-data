Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). The program takes the input values for n and m, then iterates through the permutations to find the desired permutation. It calculates the factorial and uses it to determine the index of the element to be chosen in each iteration, ensuring that it selects the correct element for the permutation. The program then removes the selected element from the list and continues the process until all elements are chosen in the correct order. The logic appears to be sound and covers all potential cases, thus the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
