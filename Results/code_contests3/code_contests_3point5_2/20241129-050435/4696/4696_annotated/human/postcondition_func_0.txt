The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` represents the length of a permutation list `p` and `b` represents an index. It then iterates through the elements of `p` based on calculations involving factorials, integer divisions, and remainders. The function prints elements from `p` based on the calculated indices and removes them sequentially. The final arrangement of printed elements depends on the calculations performed during the loop. The function does not explicitly return a value.
