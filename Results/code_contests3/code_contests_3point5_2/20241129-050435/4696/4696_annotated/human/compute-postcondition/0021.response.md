Example Answer:
The element at index `d` in list `p` is removed. The previous values of the variables `i`, `f`, `k`, `n`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`, and the element at index `d` in list `p` is removed.
Output State: **variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, `k` is less than or equal to `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`, `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`, and the element at index `d` in list `p` is removed.**
