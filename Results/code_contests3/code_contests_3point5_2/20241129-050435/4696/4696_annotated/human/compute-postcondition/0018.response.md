Example Answer:
`f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `n+1`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`.
Output State: **variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)**
