Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value of `a`, which is converted to an integer. The value of `a` is based on user input from `raw_input()`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` will be assigned a value based on user input from `raw_input()`, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` will be assigned a value based on user input from `raw_input()`, `n` is an input integer**
