Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`. The values of `i`, `f`, `k`, and `n` are unknown, so the exact value of `d` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k); `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1, `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k); `d` is assigned the result of `i` divided by `f**.
