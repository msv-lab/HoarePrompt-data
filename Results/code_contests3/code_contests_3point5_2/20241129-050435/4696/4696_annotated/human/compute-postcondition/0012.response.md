Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, so the value of `f` is the factorial of `(n - k)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, one element is removed from the list `p`, `i` is assigned the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1`.
Output State: **`b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, one element is removed from the list `p`, `i` is assigned the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1`**
