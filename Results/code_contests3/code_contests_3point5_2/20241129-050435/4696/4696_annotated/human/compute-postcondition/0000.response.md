Example Answer:
The raw_input() function accepts input and splits it into two parts, assigned to variables a and b. Since the initial state does not mention the values of a and b, the output state will be updated with the values of a and b after the input is provided.
Output State: **a and b will be assigned values based on the input provided by raw_input().**
