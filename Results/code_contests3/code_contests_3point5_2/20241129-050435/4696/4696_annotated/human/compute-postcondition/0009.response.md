Example Answer:
The code snippet removes the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The previous values of variables are known, so we can calculate the result. After removal, the list `p` will have one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, and one element is removed from the list `p`.
Output State: **`b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, and one element is removed from the list `p`**
