According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **variable `i` is assigned the result of `i` modulo `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1**
