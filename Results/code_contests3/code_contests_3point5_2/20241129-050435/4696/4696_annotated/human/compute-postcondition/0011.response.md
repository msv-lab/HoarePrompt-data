According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, one element is removed from the list `p`, and `i` is assigned the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `k` needs to be less than or equal to `n+1`.
State: **`b` is defined, `i` is defined, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is assigned the value of factorial(n - k), `d` is assigned the integer division of `i` by `f`, one element is removed from the list `p`, `i` is assigned the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `n+1`**
