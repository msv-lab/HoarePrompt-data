Example Answer: 
The code subtracts 1 from the value of `i`. However, the initial state mentions an error that `b` is not defined, and `i` is not initialized either. Therefore, the output state will be an error due to `b` not being defined and `i` not being initialized.
Output State: **Error - `b` is not defined, Error - `i` is not defined**
