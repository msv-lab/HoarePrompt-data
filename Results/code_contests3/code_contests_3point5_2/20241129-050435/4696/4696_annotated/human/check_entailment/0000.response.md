Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers n and m from the input, then generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The calculations involving factorials, integer divisions, and remainders are used to determine the order in which the elements of the permutation list are printed. The elements are printed and removed sequentially based on the calculated indices, resulting in the desired output. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
