Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It iterates through each company description, calculates the maximum salary for each company, and stores it in `arr`.
- It also keeps track of the maximum salary across all companies in `maxval`.
- Then, it calculates the total increase needed to make the maximum salary of each company equal to the overall maximum salary and stores it in `ans`.
- Finally, it prints the minimal total increase required to merge all companies, which aligns with the problem description.

Since the code covers all the steps outlined in the problem description and produces the correct output based on the provided examples, we can conclude that the code is correct.
