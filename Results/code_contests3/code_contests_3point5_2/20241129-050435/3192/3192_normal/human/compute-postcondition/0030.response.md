According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, 
`arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, 
`maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, 
`i` is 2, 
`arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, 
`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`**.
