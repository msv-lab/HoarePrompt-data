According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and the first element of `arr1` is greater than 1. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2, and `arr1[0]` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.**
