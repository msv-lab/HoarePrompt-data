According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2 and `arr1[0]` should still be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
