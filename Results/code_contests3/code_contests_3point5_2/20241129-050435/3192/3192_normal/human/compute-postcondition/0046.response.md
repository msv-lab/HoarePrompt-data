Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `maxval` and `arr[i]`, multiplied by `arr2[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this calculation is based on the values at the `n`th index of `arr` and `arr2`. After this operation, the output state is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of salaries in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all the maximum values in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is updated with a new value based on the calculation mentioned above.**
