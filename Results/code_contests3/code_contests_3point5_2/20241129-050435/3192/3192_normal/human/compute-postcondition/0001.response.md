The list `arr` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, and each company description consists of an integer m_i followed by m_i salaries that are positive integers not exceeding 10^9; arr is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, and each company description consists of an integer m_i followed by m_i salaries that are positive integers not exceeding 10^9; arr is an empty list**
