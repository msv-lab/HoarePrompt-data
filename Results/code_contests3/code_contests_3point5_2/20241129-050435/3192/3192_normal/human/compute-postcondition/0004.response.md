According to the code, the loop will execute n times as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, arr is an empty list and arr2 is an empty list does not ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, n is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, arr2 is an empty list, maxval is 0, and i is 0.
State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, arr2 is an empty list, maxval is 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
