Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`.
