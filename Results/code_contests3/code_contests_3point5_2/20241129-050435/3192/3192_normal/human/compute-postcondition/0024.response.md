According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be 3 and `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
