According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. Before the loop starts, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, so the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
