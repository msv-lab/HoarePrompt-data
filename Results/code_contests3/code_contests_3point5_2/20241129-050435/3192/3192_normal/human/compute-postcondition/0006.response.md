Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, arr2 is an empty list, maxval is 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, arr1 is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, temp is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, arr2 is an empty list, maxval is 0, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, arr1 is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers, temp is 0**
