According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n+1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `n+2`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of salaries in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all the maximum values in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n+2`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is updated with a new value based on the calculation mentioned above**.
