Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the value 0. The value of `maxval` is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, each company description consists of an integer m_i followed by m_i salaries that are positive integers not exceeding 10^9; arr is an empty list, `maxval` is 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, each company description consists of an integer m_i followed by m_i salaries that are positive integers not exceeding 10^9; arr is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
