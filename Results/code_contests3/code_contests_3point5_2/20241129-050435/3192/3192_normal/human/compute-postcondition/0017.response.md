According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing `temp`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element**
