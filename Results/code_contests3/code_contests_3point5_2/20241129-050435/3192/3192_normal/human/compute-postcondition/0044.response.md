Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of salaries in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all the maximum values in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is 0.
