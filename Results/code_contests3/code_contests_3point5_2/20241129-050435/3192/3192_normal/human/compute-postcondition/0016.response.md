Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The initial value of `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element. The value of `maxval` will be updated based on the comparison with `arr[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing `temp`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing `temp`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element**
