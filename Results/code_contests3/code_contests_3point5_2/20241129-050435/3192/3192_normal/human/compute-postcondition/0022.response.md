According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. As the loop increments `j` by 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be 2 and `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1` excluding the first element or the maximum between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 1**
