Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]` at the end of the loop. The final value of `temp` will be the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished.
