According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]` where `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is 2 and `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
