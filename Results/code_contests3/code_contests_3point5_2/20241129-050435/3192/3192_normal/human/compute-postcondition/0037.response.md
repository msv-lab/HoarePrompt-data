According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. As `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again `j` should be 3 and `arr1[0]` should remain the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 3, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after appending `temp` to `arr`, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the second time**
