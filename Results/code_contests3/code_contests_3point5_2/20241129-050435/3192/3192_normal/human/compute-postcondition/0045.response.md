According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the `arr1` list should have at least 1 integer, so `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Since `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, it means `arr` should be populated with maximum values. `arr2` contains the number of salaries in each `arr1`, so it must be appropriately filled. `maxval` is the maximum value among all the maximum values in `arr`, so it should be updated accordingly. `i` starts at `n`, so it should be adjusted accordingly. `temp` represents the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished, so it should be updated. Finally, `ans` starts at 0.
State: **Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains the number of salaries in each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all the maximum values in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input split by spaces to integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` is 0**.
