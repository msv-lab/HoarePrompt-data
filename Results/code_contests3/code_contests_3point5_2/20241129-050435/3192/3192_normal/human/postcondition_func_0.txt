The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, then iterates `n` times to process company descriptions. Each company description consists of an integer `m_i` followed by `m_i` salaries. The function calculates the maximum salary for each company description and the total cost difference between the maximum salary and the maximum salary across all companies. The final result is printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input during execution.
