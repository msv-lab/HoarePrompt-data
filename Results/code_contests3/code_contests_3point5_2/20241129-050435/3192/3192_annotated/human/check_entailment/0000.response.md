Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input about multiple companies, calculates the minimum total increase of all salaries needed to merge the companies into one, and outputs the result. The logic used in the program ensures that the maximum salaries in the companies are made equal by increasing the salaries in the companies with lower maximum salaries, while minimizing the total increase required. The annotations provided also correspond to the actions taken within the program, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
