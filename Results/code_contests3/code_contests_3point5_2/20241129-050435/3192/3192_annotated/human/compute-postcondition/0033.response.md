According to the code, the loop will execute if arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1. Also, the loop will iterate up to the value of the first element in arr1. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes:

State: **arr is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in arr1 added at the end, maxval is the maximum value among elements in arr up to index 0, i is 1, for the loop to execute the last time arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is the maximum value among all elements in arr1, j is equal to len(arr1), arr2 contains the first element of arr1 and the new element temp is appended to arr, arr1 is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, temp is 0, for the loop to execute j is in the range of 1 to the value of the first element in arr1**
