According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]`, which means `j` should be increased by 1.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the third time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3**
