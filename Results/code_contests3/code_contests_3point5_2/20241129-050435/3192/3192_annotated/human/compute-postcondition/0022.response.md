According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first element in `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value between current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list created by mapping integers from the input split by space. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `j` needs to be less than the first element of `arr1` which is already true.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the last time `arr1` has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first element in `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value between current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list created by mapping integers from the input split by space**
