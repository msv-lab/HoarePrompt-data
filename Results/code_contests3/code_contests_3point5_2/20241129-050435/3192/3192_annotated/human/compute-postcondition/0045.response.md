According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions are already set for the loop to execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(`arr1`), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
