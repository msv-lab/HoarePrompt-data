The value of `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the current `maxval`. Since `maxval` is initially 0 and `i` is 0, the initial element of `arr` will be compared to 0 and the maximum value will be assigned to `maxval`. Therefore, after execution, the new `maxval` will be the maximum value among all elements in `arr` at indices 0 to `i`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(arr1), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.**
