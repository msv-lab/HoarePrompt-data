Output State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` is equal to n-2, for the loop to execute the second last time `n` must be greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(`arr1`), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]**.
