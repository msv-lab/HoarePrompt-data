According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `arr1[0]` and the range specified in the loop. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 and `i` is 0 doesn't affect the loop execution, so these values do not need to be adjusted. The value of `temp` is also not relevant for the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**.
