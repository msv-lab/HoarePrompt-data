According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n-2`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. Also, `i` should be updated to be equal to `n-1`. Additionally, since `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute again, `arr2` should now contain the second element of `arr1`. 
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute the last time `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(`arr1`), `arr2` contains the second element of `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.
