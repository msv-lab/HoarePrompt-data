Output State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the last time `arr1` has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first element in `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value between current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list created by mapping integers from the input split by space, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
