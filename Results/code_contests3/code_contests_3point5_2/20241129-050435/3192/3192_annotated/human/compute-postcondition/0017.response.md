According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(arr1), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among elements in `arr` up to index `i`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(arr1), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
