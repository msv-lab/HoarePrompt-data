According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(`arr1`), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` should be equal to n-2.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in `arr1` added at the end, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `i` is equal to n-2, for the loop to execute the second last time `n` must be greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to len(`arr1`), `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i`
