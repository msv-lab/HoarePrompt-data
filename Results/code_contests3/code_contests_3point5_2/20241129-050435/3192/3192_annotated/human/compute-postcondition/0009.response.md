According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, and `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2**
