According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is less than the value of the first element in `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, and `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` with the new element `temp` appended to it. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than the value of the first element in `arr1`, and `temp` should be updated to be the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`.
State: **arr is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in arr1 added at the end, maxval is the maximum value among elements in arr up to index 0, i is 1, the loop will execute the last time arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is the maximum value among all elements in arr1, j is equal to len(arr1), arr2 contains the first element of arr1 and the new element temp is appended to arr, arr1 is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, temp is updated to be the maximum value between temp and arr1[j], for the loop to execute j should be in the range of 1 to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is assigned the maximum value between temp and arr1[j+1]**.
