According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, arr is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in arr1 added at the end, maxval is the maximum value among elements in arr up to index 0, i is 0, arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is the maximum value among all elements in arr1, j is equal to len(arr1), arr2 contains the first element of arr1 and the new element temp is appended to arr. So for the loop to execute one more time, n should be greater than i+1.
State: **arr is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in arr1 added at the end, maxval is the maximum value among elements in arr up to index 0, i is 1, for the loop to execute the last time arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is the maximum value among all elements in arr1, j is equal to len(arr1), arr2 contains the first element of arr1 and the new element temp is appended to arr**
