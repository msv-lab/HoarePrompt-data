According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the value of the first element in `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the value of the first element in `arr1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than the value of the first element in `arr1`.
State: **arr is a list containing integers inputted from the user along with the maximum value among all elements in arr1 added at the end, maxval is the maximum value among elements in arr up to index 0, i is 1, for the loop to execute the last time arr1 has at least 1 element and the value of the first element is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is the maximum value among all elements in arr1, j is equal to len(arr1), arr2 contains the first element of arr1 and the new element temp is appended to arr, arr1 is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input string, temp is 0, for the loop to execute j is in the range of 1 to the value of the first element in arr1, temp is assigned the maximum value between temp and arr1[j+1]**
