According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `maxval` is now 0 and i is 0.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
