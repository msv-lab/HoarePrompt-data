According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1 and should be less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is 3, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]` for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `arr1[0]`**
