According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `arr1`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is assigned the value 0 which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`temp` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
