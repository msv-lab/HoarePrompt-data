According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.
State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
