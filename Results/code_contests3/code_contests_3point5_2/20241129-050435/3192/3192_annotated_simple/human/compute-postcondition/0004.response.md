According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `maxval` is 0 and `arr2` is an empty list do not affect the loop execution but can be kept as is.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**.
