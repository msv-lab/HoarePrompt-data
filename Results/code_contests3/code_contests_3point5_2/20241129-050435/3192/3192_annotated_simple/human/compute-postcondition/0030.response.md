According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `arr1`. If `n` is greater than 0 and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, temp is the maximum value in `arr1`, n is greater than or equal to 1, arr contains the maximum value in the first element of `arr1` and temp as a new element, maxval is updated to be the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of maxval, arr2 contains the first element of `arr1`, i is equal to n. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than or equal to 1 and n should still be greater than 0.
State: **temp is the maximum value in `arr1`, n is greater than or equal to 1, arr contains the maximum value in the first element of `arr1` and temp as a new element, maxval is updated to be the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of maxval, arr2 contains the first element of `arr1`, i is equal to n, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than or equal to 1**
