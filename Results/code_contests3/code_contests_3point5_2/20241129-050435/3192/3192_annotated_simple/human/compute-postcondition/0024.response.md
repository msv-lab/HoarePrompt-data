According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than `arr1[0]`, so `j` should be incremented by 1 and `arr1[0]` should be greater than the new value of `j`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.
