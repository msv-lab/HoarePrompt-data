Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Since `i` is 0, it calculates the product of `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`. The final value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the given formula**
