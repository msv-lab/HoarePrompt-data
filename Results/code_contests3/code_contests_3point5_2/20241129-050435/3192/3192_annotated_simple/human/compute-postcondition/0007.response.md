According to the code, the loop can execute as long as arr1 has at least 1 element. Since arr1 is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, it is assumed that arr1[0] is an integer. The loop will execute if the integer value of arr1[0] is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, temp is 0 which does not affect the loop execution directly. The loop will start at index 1 and iterate until arr1[0]-1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute arr1 has at least 1 element, arr1[0] is an integer greater than 1, `j` is 1**
