Example Answer: 
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the value of `arr1[2]`. Since `temp` is already the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, no change occurs in `temp`. The value of `j` is 2, so `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[2]` is `temp` itself. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` is greater than 2.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
