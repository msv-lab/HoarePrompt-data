According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and the first element of `arr1` is greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `arr1` must have at least 2 elements with the first element being greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute arr1 has at least 2 elements, arr1[0] is an integer greater than 1, `j` is 2**
