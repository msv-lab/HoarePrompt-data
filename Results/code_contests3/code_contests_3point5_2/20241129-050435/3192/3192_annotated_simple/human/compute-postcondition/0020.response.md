According to the code, the loop can execute if `arr1` has at least one element. The loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, so `arr1[0]` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `arr` containing the maximum value in `arr1` must be updated to contain the maximum value of the first element of `arr1`. `maxval` should be updated to the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`. `arr2` should be updated to contain the first element of `arr1`. `temp` should be updated to 0. `i` must be less than `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time, so `i` should be adjusted to be equal to `n`. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` contains the maximum value in the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
