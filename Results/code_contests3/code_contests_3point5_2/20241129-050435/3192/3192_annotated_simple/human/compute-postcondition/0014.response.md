The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. Since `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, it is added to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`**
