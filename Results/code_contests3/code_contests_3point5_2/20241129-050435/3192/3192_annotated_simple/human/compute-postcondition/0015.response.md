Example Answer:
The code appends the first element of `arr1` to `arr2`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, and `arr2` is initially an empty list, after execution, `arr2` will contain the first element of `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`**
