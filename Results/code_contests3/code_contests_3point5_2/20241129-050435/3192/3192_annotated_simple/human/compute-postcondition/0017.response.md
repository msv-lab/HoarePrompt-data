According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration of the loop, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` needs to be adjusted. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` and the previous value of `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`.**
