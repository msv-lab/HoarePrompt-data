Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. This means that `temp` is added as a new element in `arr`. Since `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, it becomes the new element in `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: temp is the maximum value in arr1, n is greater than or equal to 1, arr contains the maximum value in the first element of arr1 and temp as a new element, maxval is the maximum value between the current element of arr1 and the previous value of maxval, arr2 contains the first element of arr1, i is equal to n, for the loop to execute arr1[0] must be greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **temp is the maximum value in arr1, n is greater than or equal to 1, arr contains the maximum value in the first element of arr1 and temp as a new element, maxval is the maximum value between the current element of arr1 and the previous value of maxval, arr2 contains the first element of arr1, i is equal to n, for the loop to execute arr1[0] must be greater than or equal to 1**
