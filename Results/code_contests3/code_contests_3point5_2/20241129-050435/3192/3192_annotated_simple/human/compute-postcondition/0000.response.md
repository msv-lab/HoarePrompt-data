`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The total number of companies is represented by `n`, and the description of each company consists of the number of employees and their salaries. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies with their respective employee and salary descriptions.
