Example Answer:
`temp` is appended to the `arr` list. The value of `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the maximum value in `arr1`. The value of `j` is `arr1[0]`. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `temp` is appended to the `arr` list, `j` is `arr1[0]`.
Output State: **`temp` is appended to the `arr` list, `j` is `arr1[0]**
