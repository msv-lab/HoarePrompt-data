According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the given formula**
