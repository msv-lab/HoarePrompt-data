According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `ans` is updated based on the given formula**
