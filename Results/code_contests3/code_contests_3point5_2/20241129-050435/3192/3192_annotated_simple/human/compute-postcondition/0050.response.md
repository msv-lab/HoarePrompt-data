Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` where `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `arr[i]` is the value at index `i` in `arr`, and `arr2[i]` is the number of elements in the `i-th` list `arr1`. Since the initial state is not provided for `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and other variables, the final calculation cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, and `ans` is updated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, and `ans` is updated based on the given formula**
