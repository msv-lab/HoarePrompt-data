Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each `arr1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the input to integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, and `ans` is the sum of each iteration of the formula `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
