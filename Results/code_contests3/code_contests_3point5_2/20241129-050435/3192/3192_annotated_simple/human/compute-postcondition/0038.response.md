Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is the maximum between 0 and `arr1[2]`, and `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3. After execution, `temp` will hold the new maximum value between its current value and `arr1[3]`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the maximum of `arr1[2]` and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.
Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value between 0 and the maximum of `arr1[2]` and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
