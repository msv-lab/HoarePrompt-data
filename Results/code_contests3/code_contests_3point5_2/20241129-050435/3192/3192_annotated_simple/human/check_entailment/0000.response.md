Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum total increase of all salaries in all companies in order to merge them into one company while ensuring that the maximum salaries in each company are equal. The program iterates through each company, calculates the maximum salary in each company, and then calculates the total increase needed to make the maximum salary in each company equal to the overall maximum salary. Finally, it prints the total increase needed.

The program handles all potential cases as it iterates through each company and calculates the necessary increase based on the maximum salary in each company. It follows the requirements of the problem description accurately.
