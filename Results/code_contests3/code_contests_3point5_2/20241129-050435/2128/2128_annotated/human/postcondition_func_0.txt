The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts the list `arr` in reverse order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements (or all elements if `k >= n`), and prints the sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.
