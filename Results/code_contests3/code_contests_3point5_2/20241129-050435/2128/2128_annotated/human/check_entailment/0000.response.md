Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. It reads the input correctly, sorts the barrels in reverse order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements (or all elements if `k >= n`), and prints the result. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and the minimum amount of water in the barrels after performing the given number of pourings.
