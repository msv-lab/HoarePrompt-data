Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is already assigned the integer obtained from the input. The value of `k` is dependent on the value of `n`, which is obtained from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k+1` must be less than `n`, `n`, `k` are assigned the integers obtained by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')`, `arr` is a list of integers created by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
