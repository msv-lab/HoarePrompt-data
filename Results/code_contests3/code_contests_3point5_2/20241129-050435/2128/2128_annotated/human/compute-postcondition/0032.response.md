According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n`, and `t`. If `k + 1` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`, and `l` is `k`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k + 1` must be less than `n`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`, `l` is `k+1`, for the loop to execute `k + 2` must be less than `n**.
