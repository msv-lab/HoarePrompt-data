Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is sorted in reverse order. The value of `ans` is the largest element in the list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list**
