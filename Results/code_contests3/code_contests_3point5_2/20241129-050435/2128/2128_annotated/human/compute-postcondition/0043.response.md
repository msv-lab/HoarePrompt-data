According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `l` is less than or equal to `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Also, `l` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr` remain the same, `ans` is updated, and `l` is less than or equal to `k`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` remain the same, `ans` is updated, for the loop to execute another time `l` is incremented by 1**
