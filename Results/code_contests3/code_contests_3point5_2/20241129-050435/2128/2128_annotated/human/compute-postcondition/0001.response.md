According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times, so the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than 0**
