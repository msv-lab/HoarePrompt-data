Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` in the `arr` list, which is the third largest element in the list. Since `l` is 2 and the list is sorted in reverse order, this means `ans` is increased by the third largest element in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list plus the second-largest element plus the third largest element, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute `k` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list plus the second-largest element plus the third largest element, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute `k` is less than `n`**
