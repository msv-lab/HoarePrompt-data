Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` of array `arr`. The value of `l` is incremented by 1 after this operation. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` remain the same, `ans` is updated, `l` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` remain the same, `ans` is updated, `l` is incremented by 1**
