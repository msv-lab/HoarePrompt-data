Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`. No variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers from input, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`, `l` is `k`, for the loop to execute `k + 1` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers from input, `ans` is the sum of the first `k+1` elements of `arr`, `l` is `k`, for the loop to execute `k + 1` must be less than `n`**
