Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers. `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `arr`. `l` equals `k`. For the loop to execute, `k+1` must be less than `n`. `n`, `k` are assigned the integers obtained by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')`. `arr` is a list of integers created by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program remains in the same state as described above.***
