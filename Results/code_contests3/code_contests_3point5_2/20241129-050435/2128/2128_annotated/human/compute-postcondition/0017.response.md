According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k` must be less than `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `k` needs to be less than `n`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k+1` must be less than `n`**
