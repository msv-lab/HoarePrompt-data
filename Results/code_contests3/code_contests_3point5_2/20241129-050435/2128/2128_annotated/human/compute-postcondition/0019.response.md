Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k+1` must be less than `n`, `n`, `k` are assigned the integers obtained by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')`, `arr` is a list of integers created by mapping the input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`**
