According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k+1`. If `l` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than `k+1`. So for the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` remain the same, `ans` is updated to be the largest element of `arr` plus the element at index `l` of `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be incremented by 1**
