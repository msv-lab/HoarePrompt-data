Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is already assigned an integer value from the input. Since `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `k` after execution is less than `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list. k is greater than or equal to n.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list. k is greater than or equal to n**
