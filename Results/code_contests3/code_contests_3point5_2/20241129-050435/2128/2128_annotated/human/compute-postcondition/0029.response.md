Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` from `arr`, which is 2. Therefore, after execution, `ans` becomes 4. The other variables remain the same. The loop will execute again if `k + 3 < n` is true, but the values of `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, and `l` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l` is 2, `ans` is 4**
