According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `k`, and `n`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are integers from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr` plus the value at index `l`, `l` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k + 1` must be less than `n` and `l` needs to be incremented.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr` plus the value at index `l`, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute `k + 2` must be less than `n**.
