Example Answer:
`ans` is printed, but the value of `ans` is unknown as it was not assigned a specific value in the provided code snippet. The other variables remain the same and the loop does not execute. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l`, `ans` remain the same, `l` is incremented by 1, the loop does not execute.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr`, `l`, `ans` remain the same, `l` is incremented by 1, the loop does not execute**
