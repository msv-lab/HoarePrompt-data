According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, `k` is less than `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1 and it needs to remain less than or equal to `k`.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list plus the second-largest element, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute `k` is less than `n**
