Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, which is the largest element as `arr` is sorted in descending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, `l` is `k+1`, for the loop to execute `k + 2` must be less than `n`, `n`, `k` are assigned the integer values obtained from mapping the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k+1`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, `l` is `k+1`, for the loop to execute `k + 2` must be less than `n`, `n`, `k` are assigned the integer values obtained from mapping the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
