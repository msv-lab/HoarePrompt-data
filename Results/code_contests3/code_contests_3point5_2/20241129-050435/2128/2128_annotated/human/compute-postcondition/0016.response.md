Example Answer:
The code simply prints out the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`. No variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr` are integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in the sorted list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k`, for the loop to execute `k` must be less than `n`**
