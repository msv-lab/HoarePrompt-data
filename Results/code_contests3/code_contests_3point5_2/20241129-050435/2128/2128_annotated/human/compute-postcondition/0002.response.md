Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input separated by a space. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned integer values obtained from the input**
