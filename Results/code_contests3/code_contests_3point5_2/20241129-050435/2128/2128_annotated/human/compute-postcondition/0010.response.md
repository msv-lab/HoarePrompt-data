Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[l]` is the second-largest element in the list. Therefore, `ans` is increased by the second-largest element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the largest element in the list plus the second-largest element, `l` is 1, for the loop to execute `k` is less than `n`**
