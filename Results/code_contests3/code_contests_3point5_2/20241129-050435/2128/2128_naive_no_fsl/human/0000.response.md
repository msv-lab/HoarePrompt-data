Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the number of barrels is less than or equal to the number of pourings allowed. In this case, the program should output the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels, which is not taken care of in the provided code. 

For example, if the input is:
```
1
3 3
2 5 7
```
The expected output should be `5` (pour 2 units from barrel 3 to barrel 1), but the program will give an incorrect output.
