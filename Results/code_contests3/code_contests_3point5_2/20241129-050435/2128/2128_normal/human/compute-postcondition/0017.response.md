According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` is printed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **The sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is incremented by 1**
