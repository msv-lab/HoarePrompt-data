Example Answer:
The list `arr` is populated with integers from the input. The `k` value is used to calculate the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr`. Variable `i` is incremented by 1. The elements in the list `arr` are then sorted in descending order. Finally, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`.**
