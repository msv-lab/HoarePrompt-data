Example Answer:
The elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order. The previous state of the list `arr` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values of the elements. Therefore, the Output State is: The sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input using `map` and `split` functions, and the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order.
Output State: **The sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input using `map` and `split` functions, and the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order.**
