Example Answer:
Initially, the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`. After executing the code `k = n - 1`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. 
Output State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`**
