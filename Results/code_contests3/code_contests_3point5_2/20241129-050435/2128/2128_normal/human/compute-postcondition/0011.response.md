According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. As `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` have values parsed from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr` plus the value of `arr[2]`, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is 2**
