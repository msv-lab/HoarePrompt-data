Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, where `arr` is sorted in descending order. The value at index 0 of `arr` is the largest element. Therefore, `ans` will be assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`**
