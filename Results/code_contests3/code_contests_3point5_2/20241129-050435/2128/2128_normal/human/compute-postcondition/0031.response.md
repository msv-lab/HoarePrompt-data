Output State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted `arr` list. If `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, for the loop to execute, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l` in the list `arr`.**
