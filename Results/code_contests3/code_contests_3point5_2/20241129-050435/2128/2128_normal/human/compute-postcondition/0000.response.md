Example Answer:
t is assigned the value of int(sys.stdin.readline()), where sys.stdin.readline() reads an integer from the standard input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list of initial water amounts a_i for each barrel contains n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; t is the number of test cases read from the standard input.
Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases read from the standard input.**
