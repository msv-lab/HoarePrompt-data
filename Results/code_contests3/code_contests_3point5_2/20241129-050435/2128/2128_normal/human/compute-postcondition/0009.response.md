According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is within the range of 1 to `k` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` have values parsed from input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`, `arr` is a list of integers parsed from input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()) sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is 1**
