According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, the sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted `arr` list, and if `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `i` by 1
- Update `k` to be greater than or equal to 1
- Increment `l` by 1
- Increment `ans` by the element at index `l` in the list `arr`

State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, the elements in the list `arr` are sorted in descending order, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`.**
