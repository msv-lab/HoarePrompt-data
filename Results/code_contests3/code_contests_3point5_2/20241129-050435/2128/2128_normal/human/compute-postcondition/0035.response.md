Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so we cannot calculate the sum of the first `k+1` elements in the list `arr`. However, `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`.
Output State: **The sum of the first `k+1` elements in `arr` is printed, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by the element at index `l+1` in the list `arr`**
