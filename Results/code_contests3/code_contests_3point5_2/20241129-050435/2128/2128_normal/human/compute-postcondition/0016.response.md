Example Answer:
Initially, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` have values parsed from input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.

When we print `ans`, it will output the value of the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`.

Output State: **The sum of the first `k` elements in `arr` is printed**
