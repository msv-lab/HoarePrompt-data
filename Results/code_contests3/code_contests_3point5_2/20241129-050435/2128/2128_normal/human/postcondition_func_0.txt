The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`, for each test case, it reads the number of barrels `n`, and a parameter `k`. It then reads the initial water amounts for each barrel, sorts them in descending order, and calculates the sum of the first `k+1` elements of the sorted array. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it sets `k` to `n-1`. The function prints the sum for each test case. The function handles multiple test cases efficiently without returning any specific value.
