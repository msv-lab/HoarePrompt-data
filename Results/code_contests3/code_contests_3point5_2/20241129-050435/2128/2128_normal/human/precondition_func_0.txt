t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list of initial water amounts a_i for each barrel contains n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
