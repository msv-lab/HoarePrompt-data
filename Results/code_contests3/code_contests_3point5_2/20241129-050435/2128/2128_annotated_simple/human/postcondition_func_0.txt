The function reads input from the standard input, processes the data for each test case, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements of a sorted array `arr`, and prints the result. It handles cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n` by adjusting `k` to `n - 1`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns a predefined output.
