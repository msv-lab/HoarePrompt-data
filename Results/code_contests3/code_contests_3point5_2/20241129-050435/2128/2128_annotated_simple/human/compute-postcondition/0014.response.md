Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `ans` will be the sum of the first element of array `arr` and the element at index `l+1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first element of array `arr` and the element at index `l+1`**
