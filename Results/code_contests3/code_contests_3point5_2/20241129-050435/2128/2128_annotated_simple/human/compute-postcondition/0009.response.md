According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the initial states of `t`, `n`, and `ans` are already positive integers and `ans` is the first element of array `arr`, so they do not need to be adjusted.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of array `arr`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `l` is 1**
