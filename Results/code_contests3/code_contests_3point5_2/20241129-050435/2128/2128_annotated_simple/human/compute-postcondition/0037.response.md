Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is a positive integer. As per the initial state conditions, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is one less than `n`. Therefore, after execution, `k` is guaranteed to be one less than `n` even if it was initially equal to `n`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is one less than `n`.**
