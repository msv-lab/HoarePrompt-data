Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`, where `arr` is sorted in descending order and `l` is updated for the loop to execute one more time. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is updated for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is updated for the loop to execute one more time**
