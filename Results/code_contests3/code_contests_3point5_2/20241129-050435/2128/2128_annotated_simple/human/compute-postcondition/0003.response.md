Example Answer:
The code reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it based on spaces, converts each element into an integer, and creates a list `arr` containing those integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input**
