Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
