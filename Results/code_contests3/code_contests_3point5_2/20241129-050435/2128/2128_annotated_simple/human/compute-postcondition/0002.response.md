Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by mapping the integers obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The values of `n` and `k` depend on the input, so their specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input**
