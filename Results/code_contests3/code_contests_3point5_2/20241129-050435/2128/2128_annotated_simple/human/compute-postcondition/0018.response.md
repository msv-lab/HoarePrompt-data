Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input read from the standard input, assuming the input was in the correct format. The values of `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `t`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `t`**
