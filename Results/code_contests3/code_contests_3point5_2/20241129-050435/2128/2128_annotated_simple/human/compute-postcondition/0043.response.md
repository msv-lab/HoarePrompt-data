According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding the element at index `l` of array `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `l` is 3, `ans` is updated by adding the element at index `l` of array `arr`**
