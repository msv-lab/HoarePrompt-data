According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of the array `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is one less than `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of the array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is one less than `n`**
