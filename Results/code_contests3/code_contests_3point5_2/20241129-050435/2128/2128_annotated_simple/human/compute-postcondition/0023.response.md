Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the array `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` >= `n`, then `k` is one less than `n`.***
