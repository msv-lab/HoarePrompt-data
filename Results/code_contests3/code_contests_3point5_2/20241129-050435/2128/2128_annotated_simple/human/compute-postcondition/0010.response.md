Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. The initial value of `ans` is the first element of array `arr`, and the loop condition requires `k` to be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first element of array `arr` and `arr[l]`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first element of array `arr` and `arr[l]**
