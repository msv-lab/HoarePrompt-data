Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, `l` are positive integers; `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of the sorted array `arr`; `i` is equal to `t`; `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`; `l` is equal to `k`; the value of `ans` is printed for each iteration of the loop.**
