Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the array `arr`. The content of array `arr` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `ans` is the first element of array `arr`.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `ans` is the first element of array `arr`**
