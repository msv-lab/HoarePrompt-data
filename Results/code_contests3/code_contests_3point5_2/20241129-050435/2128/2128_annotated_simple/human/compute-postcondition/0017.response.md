According to the code, the loop can execute `t` times, each time incrementing `i` by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `t` (i < t).

State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `t`**
