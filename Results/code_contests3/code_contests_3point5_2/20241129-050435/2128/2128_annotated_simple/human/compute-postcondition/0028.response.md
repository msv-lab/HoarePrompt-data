According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is updated, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is updated. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is updated for the loop to execute one more time**
