According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `l` is 1, and `ans` is updated by adding the element at index `l` of array `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. So, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the sorted array `arr`, `i` is less than `t+1`, `k` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `n`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding the element at index `l` of array `arr`**
