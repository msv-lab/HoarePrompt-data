According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `k`, and `n`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `ans` and `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `ans` and `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, for the loop to execute one more time `l` should be one more than the previous value of `l`.**
