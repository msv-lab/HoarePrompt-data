Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is a positive integer. The value of `n` is known to be a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `k` will be one less than the value of `n`. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the first element of the array `arr`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by mapping input from `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `k` is one less than `n`**
