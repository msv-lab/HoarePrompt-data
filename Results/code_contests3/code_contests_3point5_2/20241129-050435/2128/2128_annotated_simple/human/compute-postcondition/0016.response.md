Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is determined based on the condition: if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`. The initial state shows that `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, and `ans` is calculated accordingly based on the condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements of array `arr` if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is the sum of all elements in the array `arr`**
