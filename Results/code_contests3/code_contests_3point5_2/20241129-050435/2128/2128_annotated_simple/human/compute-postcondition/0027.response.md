Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The value of `l` should be one more than its previous value for the loop to execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` are positive integers, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, `i` is less than `t`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is updated for the loop to execute one more time.**
