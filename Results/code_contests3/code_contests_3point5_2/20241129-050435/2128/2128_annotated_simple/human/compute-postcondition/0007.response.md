Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, after execution, `k` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `ans` is the first element of array `arr`, `k` is a positive integer**
