Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game.
2. It calculates the sum of all the coins.
3. It then checks if the sum is divisible by 5 (the number of players) and not equal to 0, which is a valid condition for the initial bet to exist.
4. If the condition is met, it calculates and prints the initial bet amount.
5. If the condition is not met, it prints -1 as there is no valid initial bet amount. 

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and implements the logic correctly.
