Correctness: **True**

The program reads a list of integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the sum of these integers and checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is not divisible by the number of players or if the sum is 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average number of coins each player initially bet.

This program follows the problem description correctly. It determines the initial bet size based on the final number of coins each player has at the end of the game as described in the problem statement. It covers all possible cases where a solution can be obtained or where it is not possible to find a valid initial bet size.
