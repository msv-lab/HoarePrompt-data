Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element returned by `raw_input().split()`. The values of `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are not directly affected, but they are included in the input processed by `map`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100**
