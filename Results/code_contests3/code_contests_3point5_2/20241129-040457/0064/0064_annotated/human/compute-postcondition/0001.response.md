Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the sum of `c`, where `c` is a list of integers. The values of `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the sum `s` will be between 0 and 500. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers between 0 and 100; `s` is the sum of `c` between 0 and 500**
