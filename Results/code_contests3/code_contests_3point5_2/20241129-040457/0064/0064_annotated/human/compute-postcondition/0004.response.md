Functionality: **The function reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers in the list, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by the length of the list, or the average of the integers in the list if the sum is divisible by the length of the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
