Example Answer:
The code snippet checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or if the remainder of the sum divided by the length of list `c` is not 0. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the division of `s` by the length of list `c`. Since the initial state does not provide the values of list `c`, we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers between 0 and 100; `s` is the sum of `c` between 0 and 500.
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers between 0 and 100; `s` is the sum of `c` between 0 and 500**
