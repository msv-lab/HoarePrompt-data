Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values into a list `c`, calculates the sum of the elements in `c`, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not evenly divisible by the number of elements in `c`, or the average of the elements in `c` if the sum is not 0 and is evenly divisible. The function does not accept any parameters and solely operates on the input values.**
