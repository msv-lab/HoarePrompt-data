Example Answer:
The `map` function converts the input values from `raw_input().split()` into integers and stores them in variable `c`. As `c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5` are integers between 0 and 100, the values stored in `c` will also be integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100.`
Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100`**
