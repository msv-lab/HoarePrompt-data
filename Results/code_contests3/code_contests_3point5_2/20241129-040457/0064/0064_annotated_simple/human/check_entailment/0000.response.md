Correctness: **True**

The program takes input as five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the total sum of coins and checks if it is divisible by the number of players. If the total sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the average number of coins each player initially bet.

This program correctly follows the problem description as it determines the initial bet size 'b' based on the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. If the conditions specified in the problem description are not met, it returns -1.
