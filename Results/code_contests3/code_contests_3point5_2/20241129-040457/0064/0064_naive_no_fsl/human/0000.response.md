Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players. If either condition is met, it outputs -1, indicating that there is no possible initial bet value. Otherwise, it divides the sum by the number of players to determine the initial bet value.

The program logic aligns with the problem description as it correctly calculates the initial bet value if it is possible based on the given final coin amounts for each player. The logic covers all potential cases and edge cases, ensuring that the output is either the correct initial bet value or -1 if no such value exists.
