Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum `s` is equal to 0 or not divisible by the length of the list `c`. If the conditions are met, it prints -1, otherwise, it prints the result of `s` divided by the length of `c`. Since `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, and the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are between 0 and 100, the sum `s` will also be within a valid range. The length of list `c` is 5. Therefore, if `s` is not 0 and is divisible by 5, it will print the result of `s / 5`, otherwise, it will print -1.
Output State: **The output will be either the result of s / 5 if s is not 0 and divisible by 5, or -1**
