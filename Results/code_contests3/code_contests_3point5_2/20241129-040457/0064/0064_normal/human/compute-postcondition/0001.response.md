Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the sum of all `c` values. Given that `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers between 0 and 100, the sum of these values can range from 0 to 500. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100; `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100; `s` is the sum of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5**
