Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the sum of these integers and checks if the sum is 0 or not evenly divisible by the number of players. If the sum is 0 or not divisible, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the sum divided by the number of players as the initial bet amount for each player.

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the case where the sum of coins is not evenly divisible by the number of players and prints -1, as specified. It also calculates the initial bet amount correctly when the sum is divisible by the number of players. Therefore, the code is correct.
