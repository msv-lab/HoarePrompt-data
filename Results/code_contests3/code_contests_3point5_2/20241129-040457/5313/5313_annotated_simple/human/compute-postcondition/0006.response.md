Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and the product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`, the value of `x` can be calculated based on `n`. Then, `answr` is calculated according to the value of `x`. 
Output State: **`x` is the integer square root of `n`, the product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated based on the value of `x`.**
