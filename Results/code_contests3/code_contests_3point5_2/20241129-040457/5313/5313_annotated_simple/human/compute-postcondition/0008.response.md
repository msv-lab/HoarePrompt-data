Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 times the sum of `x` and 1. The condition `(x * (x + 1) > n)` is false, so `x` is the integer square root of `n`. Therefore, `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`. 
Output State: **`x` is the integer square root of `n`, the condition `(x * (x + 1) > n)` is false, `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`**
