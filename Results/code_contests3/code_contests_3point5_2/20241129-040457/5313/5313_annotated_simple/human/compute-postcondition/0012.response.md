Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `answr`. The value of `x` is not used in the code snippet, so it remains as the integer square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is an integer.
Output State: **`x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is an integer**
