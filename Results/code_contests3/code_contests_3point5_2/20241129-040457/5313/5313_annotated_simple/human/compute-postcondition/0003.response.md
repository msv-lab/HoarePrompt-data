Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and the square of `x` is equal to `n`, we can infer that `x` is a perfect square root. Therefore, `answr` is calculated as `x * 4` where `x` is the square root of `n`. 
Output State: **`answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`**
