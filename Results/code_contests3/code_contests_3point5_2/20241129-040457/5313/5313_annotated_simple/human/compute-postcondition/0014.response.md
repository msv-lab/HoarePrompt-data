Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and based on certain conditions, determines the value of `answr`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, `answr` is `x * 4`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1) <= n`, then `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`. The function then prints the integer value of `answr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
