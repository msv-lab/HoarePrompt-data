Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is an input integer. The square root of `n` is calculated and then converted to an integer. Since the value of `n` is not specified, the output state will be: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n**
