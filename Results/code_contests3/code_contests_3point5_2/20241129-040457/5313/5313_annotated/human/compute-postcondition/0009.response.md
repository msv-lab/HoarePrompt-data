Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n. If the product of x and (x + 1) is greater than n, `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, if the condition (x * (x + 1) > n) is false, `answr` is equal to 4 times the integer square root of n plus 4.***
