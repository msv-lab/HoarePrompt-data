Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated as 4 times the sum of `x` and 1. The condition given `(x * (x + 1) > n)` is false, so `x` is the integer square root of `n`. Therefore, the value of `answr` is 4 times the integer square root of `n` plus 4. 
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n, the condition (x * (x + 1) > n) is false, answr is 4 times the integer square root of n plus 4**
