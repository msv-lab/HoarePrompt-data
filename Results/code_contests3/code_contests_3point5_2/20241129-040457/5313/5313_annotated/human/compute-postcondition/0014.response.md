Functionality: **The function `func` takes an integer input `n`, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and based on certain conditions, determines the value of `answr`. If the square of `x` equals `n`, `answr` is set to 4 times `x`. If the product of `x` and (`x + 1`) is greater than `n`, `answr` is assigned `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is set to 4 times `x` plus 4. The final value of `answr` is then printed. The function does not have any return value.**
