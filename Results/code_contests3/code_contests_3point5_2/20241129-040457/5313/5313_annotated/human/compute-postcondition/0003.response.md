Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n` such that the square of `x` equals `n`. Therefore, `answr` is `n` multiplied by 4. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, n is an input integer, x is the integer square root of n. The square of x equals n, answr is 4 times the integer square root of n**
