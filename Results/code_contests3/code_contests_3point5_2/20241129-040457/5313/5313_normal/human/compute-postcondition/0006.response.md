Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `n` and `x` is not a perfect square root of `n`. The product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, so the value of `x` is a decimal number. The calculation of `(x + x + 1) * 2` would result in a decimal number as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`. `x` is not a perfect square root of `n`. The product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is a decimal number.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`. `x` is not a perfect square root of `n`. The product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is a decimal number**
