Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1). Since x is the square root of n and x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, the value of x is not a perfect square root of n. Therefore, the value of answr will be 4 * (x + 1). 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` which is not a perfect square root of n, `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
