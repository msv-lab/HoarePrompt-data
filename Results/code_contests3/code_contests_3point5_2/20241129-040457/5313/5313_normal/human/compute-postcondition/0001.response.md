Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n` as an integer. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `x` will be the square root of that integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`**
