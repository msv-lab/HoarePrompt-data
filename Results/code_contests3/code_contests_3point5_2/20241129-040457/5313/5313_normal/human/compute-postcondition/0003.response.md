Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by 4. Since `x` is the square root of `n` and the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `x` can be either the square root of `n` or -1 times the square root of `n`. Therefore, `answr` can be 4 times the square root of `n` or -4 times the square root of `n`. The Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`, `answr` is either 4 times the square root of `n` or -4 times the square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n`, `answr` is either 4 times the square root of `n` or -4 times the square root of `n`**
