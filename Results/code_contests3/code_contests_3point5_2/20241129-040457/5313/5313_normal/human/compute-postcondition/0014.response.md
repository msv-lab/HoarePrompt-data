Functionality: **The function prompts the user for an integer input `n`, calculates the square root of `n`, and based on certain conditions, determines the value of `answr`. If the square of the square root of `n` equals `n`, `answr` is set to either 4 times or -4 times the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, `answr` is a decimal number; otherwise, it is set to 4 times the square root of `n` plus 4. The final result is printed as an integer. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return a value.**
