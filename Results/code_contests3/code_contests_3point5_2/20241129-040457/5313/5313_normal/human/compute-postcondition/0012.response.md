Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as the square root of `n`. Depending on the conditions mentioned, the value of `answr` is determined. If `x^2 = n`, then `answr` is either 4 times the square root of `n` or -4 times the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is a decimal number. Otherwise, `answr` is 4 * (x + 1) converted to an integer. The output state includes the final value of `answr`.
Output State: **final value of `answr`**
