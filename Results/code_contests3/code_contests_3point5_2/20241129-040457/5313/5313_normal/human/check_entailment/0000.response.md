Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input `n`, calculates the square root of `n`, and based on certain conditions, determines the value of `answr`. If the square of the square root of `n` equals `n`, `answr` is set to either 4 times or -4 times the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, `answr` is a decimal number; otherwise, it is set to 4 times the square root of `n` plus 4. The final result is printed as an integer.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code aligns with the problem requirements. The code correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose the given number of city blocks. The logic implemented in the code seems to cover all the cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output appears to be consistent with the expected behavior. Therefore, the correctness of the code is considered True.
