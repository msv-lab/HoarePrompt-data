Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter required to enclose N city blocks as specified in the problem description. It first calculates the square root of N and then checks if the square of the calculated square root is equal to N. Based on this condition, it calculates the minimum perimeter required and outputs the result. 

For all the given examples in the problem description, the program provides the correct output. Additionally, it covers all potential cases where the perimeter needs to be calculated for the given number of city blocks. Therefore, the program can be deemed correct.
