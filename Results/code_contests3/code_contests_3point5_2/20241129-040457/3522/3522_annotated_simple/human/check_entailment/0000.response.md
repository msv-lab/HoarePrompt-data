Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always produce the correct output as described in the problem. 

1. The program incorrectly assumes that if an integer is not in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then it can be split into composite summands. This is not always true. For example, for input 6, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. 6 cannot be split into composite summands.

2. The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. It only considers odd numbers and subtracts 9 from them, which is not a valid approach for all cases.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description and may provide incorrect output for certain inputs.
