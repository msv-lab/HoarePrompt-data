According to the code snippet, the loop executes based on the input provided. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a value greater than 1, and `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, otherwise `c` remains 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `a` must be considered. If `a` is in the specified list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the value of `a` must be adjusted based on the conditions mentioned. If `a` is not in the specified list, then the new value of `a` must be determined accordingly to satisfy the conditions at the beginning of the next iteration.

State: **`a` needs to be adjusted based on the conditions specified in the code snippet to determine whether to print -1 or `a / 4 + c`**.
