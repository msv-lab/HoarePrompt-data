Example Answer: 
If `a` is not divisible by 2, then `a` is updated to the result of (user input - 9) and `c` is set to 1. After that, the code checks if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed. 

Output State: **If `a` is not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), print the result of `a / 4 + 1` after updating `a` with the user input value minus 9.**
