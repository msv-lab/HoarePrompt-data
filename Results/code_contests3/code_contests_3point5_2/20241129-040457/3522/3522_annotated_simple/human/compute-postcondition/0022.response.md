Output State: **`a` is a value greater than 1, `c` is 1 if the last `a` in the loop is odd, otherwise `c` remains 0. The output of the code snippet depends on whether the last `a` in the loop is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or not. If it is in the list, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of the last `a / 4 + c` is printed.**
