Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input()` accepts an input. The input must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, the Output State is: each query input `ni` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute at least once `input()` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is assigned an input value.
Output State: **each query input `ni` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute at least once `input()` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is assigned an input value**
