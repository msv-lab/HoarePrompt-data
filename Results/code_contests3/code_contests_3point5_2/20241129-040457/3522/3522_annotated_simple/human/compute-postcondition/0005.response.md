Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 1, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 after subtracting 9.
Output State: **`c` is 1, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 after subtracting 9**
