According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the output of the `input()` function. If the output is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the output of the `input()` function is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the output of the `input()` function must be greater than 1.
State: **The output of the `input()` function is greater than 1**
