Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by 9. Since the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0, the new value of `a` will still not be divisible by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 0, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 after subtracting 9.
Output State: **`c` is 0, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not equal to 0 after subtracting 9**
