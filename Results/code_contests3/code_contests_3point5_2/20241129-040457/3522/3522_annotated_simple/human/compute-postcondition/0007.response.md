Example Answer:
If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is not in the set and `a` is divided by 4, the result is added to `c`. If `a % 2 != 0` after subtracting 9, `c` is set to 1. 
Output State: **The output depends on the value of `a` and whether `c` is set to 1 or remains 0.**
