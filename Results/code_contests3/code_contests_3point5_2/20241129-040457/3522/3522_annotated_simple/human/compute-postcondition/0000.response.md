According to the code, the loop will execute `input()` number of times. Since each query input ni is a positive integer greater than 1, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state such that at least one iteration of the loop will occur. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **Each query input ni is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute at least once `input()` is greater than or equal to 1**
