The function does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a range of values based on user input, performs calculations on each value, and prints the result. If the input value is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets c to 1, then checks if the value is in a predefined list. If the value is in the list, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of the value divided by 4 plus c. The function outputs positive integers greater than 1.
