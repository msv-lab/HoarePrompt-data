According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value `a`. If the input value is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the input value where the loop executed the first time if the input value is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is an integer, `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd number. So for the loop to execute one more time, the input value `a` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`a` is the input value where the loop will execute if the input value is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is an integer, `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd number**
