Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9`, `c` is set to 1, and the final output is -1. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a`, `c` remains 0, and the final output is -1. The conditional statement checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and prints -1 if true. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c` and prints the result.

Output State: **If `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9`, `c` is set to 1, and the final output is -1. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a`, `c` remains 0, and the final output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c` depending on the value of `a`.**
