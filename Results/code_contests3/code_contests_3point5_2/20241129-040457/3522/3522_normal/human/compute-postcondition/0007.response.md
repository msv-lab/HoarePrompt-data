Example Answer:
If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is not in the set and `a` is greater than or equal to 1, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed. If `a` is an odd number, `c` is set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input value where the loop will execute the first time if the input value is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is an integer, and `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd number.
Output State: **`a` is the input value where the loop will execute the first time if the input value is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is an integer, `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd number**
