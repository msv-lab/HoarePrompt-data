Example Answer:
The value of `a` is taken as input. If `a` is odd and `a - 9` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` becomes 1. If `a` is even, `a` remains the same and `c` remains 0. The final output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`.

Output State: **`a` is the input value, `c` is either 0 or 1, and the final output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`**
