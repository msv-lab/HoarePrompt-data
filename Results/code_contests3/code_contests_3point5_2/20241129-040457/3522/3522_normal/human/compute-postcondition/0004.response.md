Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - 9`, where `a` is the input value. Since the input value `a` is odd and not divisible by 2, subtracting 9 from it will result in another odd number. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an odd number, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is an odd number, `c` is 0**
