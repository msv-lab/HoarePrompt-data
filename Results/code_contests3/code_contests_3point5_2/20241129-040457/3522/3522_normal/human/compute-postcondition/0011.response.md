Example Answer:
`a` is reassigned the value of `a` minus 9. The new value of `a` will depend on the initial input value. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the new input value after subtracting 9; `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is the new input value after subtracting 9; `c` is 0**
