According to the code, the loop will execute based on the return value of the `input()` function. If the return value is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the return value of the `input()` function is greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **for the loop to execute the first time the return value of `input()` is greater than or equal to 1**
