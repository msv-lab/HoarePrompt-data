According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `a`. If `a` is odd, it is updated to `a - 9` and `c` becomes 1. If `a` is even, `a` remains the same and `c` remains 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the input value. So for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the updated value of `a` after the previous iteration.

If the input value `a` is odd, then for the loop to execute again in the next iteration, `a` should be updated to `a - 9`. In this case, `a - 9` must be odd for the loop to run again.

If the input value `a` is even, then for the loop to execute again in the next iteration, `a` should remain the same.

State: **If the input value `a` is odd and `a - 9` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` becomes 1. If the input value `a` is even, `a` remains the same and `c` remains 0. The output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`.**
