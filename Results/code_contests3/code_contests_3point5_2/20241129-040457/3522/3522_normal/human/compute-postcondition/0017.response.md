Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. The value of `a` is unknown, but `c` is now 0. The final output will be -1 since `c` is 0 and the result of `a / 4 + c` will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input value, `c` is 0, and the final output is -1.
Output State: **`a` is the input value, `c` is 0, and the final output is -1**
