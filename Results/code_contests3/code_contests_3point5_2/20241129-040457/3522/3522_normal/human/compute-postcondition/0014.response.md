Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, `a` remains the same and `c` remains 0. Then, if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `a / 4 + c` is printed. 
Output State: **`a` is the input value. If `a` is odd, `a` is updated to `a - 9` and `c` is 1. If `a` is even, `a` remains the same and `c` remains 0. The output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`.**
