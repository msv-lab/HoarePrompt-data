Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description. The code only considers specific values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and does not cover all possible composite numbers. For example, if the input is a composite number such as 9, the code will not provide the correct output. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
