The function does not accept any input arguments. It iterates over a range of values based on the user's input, performs operations on the input value `a`, and then prints either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is determined based on the parity of `a`. If `a` is odd, `a` is modified to `a - 9` and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, no changes are made to `a` and `c` remains 0. The output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c` depending on the value of `a`.
