Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It checks if the input number is odd, then subtracts 9 from it and increments the count by 1. It then checks if the number is in the list of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and returns -1 if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible number of composite summands by dividing the number by 4 and adding the count if it was odd. The program covers all the conditions specified in the problem description and provides the correct output for each query.
