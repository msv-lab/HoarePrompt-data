Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the case where the input number is odd by subtracting 9 and setting a flag to indicate that one composite summand is used. It then checks if the remaining number is in the list of prime numbers less than 12, and if not, calculates the maximum possible number of summands by dividing by 4 and adding the flag value. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output according to the problem description.
