Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over the queries, modifies the input integer `a` based on whether it is odd or even, and then calculates the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands. The program outputs -1 if the input integer is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it calculates the result as `a / 4 + c`.

The program handles all cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.
