Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `a` and `c` will be determined by the input values provided during the loop execution. If `a` is odd, it will be decreased by 9 and `c` will be set to 1. If `a` is even, `c` will remain 0. Then, the final output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it will be the result of `a / 4 + c`.**
