Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by 9. Since the initial value of `a` is a positive integer not divisible by 2, the new value of `a` will also be a positive integer not divisible by 2. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds a positive integer value not divisible by 2, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` holds a positive integer value not divisible by 2, `c` is 0**
