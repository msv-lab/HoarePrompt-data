Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. Since the initial state mentions that `c` is either updated to 1 or remains the same, after executing the code, the value of `c` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds a positive integer value, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` holds a positive integer value, `c` is 0**
