Example Answer: 
`a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its previous value. The value of `a` before the operation is unknown, so after execution, `a` will be `a - 9`. The value of `c` remains 0 since it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `a - 9`, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is `a - 9`, `c` is 0**
