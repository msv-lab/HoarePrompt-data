According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. 
If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. 
If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. 
Then, if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is:
- If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is 1.
- If `a` is even, `c` remains 0.
- If `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last `a` was odd, the new `a` should be the previous `a` - 9.
- If the last `a` was odd, the new `c` should be 1.
- If the last `a` was even, the new `c` should be 0.
- If the last `a` was in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the loop should print -1. Otherwise, it should print `a / 4 + c`.

State: **If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9, `c` is 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. If `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.**
