According to the code, the loop executes based on the input value. In this case, the state of `a` and `c` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `a` is not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the value of `c` depends on whether `a` is divisible by 2 or not. 

If `a` is not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and not divisible by 2, then `c` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `c` remains the same.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated states are as follows:
State: **`a` holds a positive integer value, if `a` is not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and not divisible by 2, `c` is updated to 1, otherwise `c` remains the same**
