Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned through user input. Depending on the value entered, if `a` is not in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and not divisible by 2, then `c` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `c` remains the same. Since the initial state of `c` is not given, we can't determine the final value of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds a positive integer value, and `c` is either updated to 1 or remains the same.
Output State: **`a` holds a positive integer value, and `c` is either updated to 1 or remains the same**
