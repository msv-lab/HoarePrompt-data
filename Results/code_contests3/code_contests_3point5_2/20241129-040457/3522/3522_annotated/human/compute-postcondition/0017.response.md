Example Answer: 
The value of `c` is assigned 0. Since there are no conditional statements or operations that affect `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. The initial state for `a` is not provided, so it can be any integer value. As a result, the output state is: `a` is unchanged, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `c` is 0**
