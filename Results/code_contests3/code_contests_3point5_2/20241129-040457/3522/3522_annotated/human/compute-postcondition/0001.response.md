Example Answer:
The value returned by the input function is stored in variable `a`. Since the initial state specifies that the value returned by the input function is greater than 0, we can assume that `a` will hold a positive integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` holds a positive integer value.
Output State: **`a` holds a positive integer value**
