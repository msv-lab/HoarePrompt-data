Example Answer: 
If `a` is an odd number, then it will be decreased by 9 and `c` will be set to 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. After that, the code checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. Based on the initial state, the output state will depend on the value of `a` and `c`.

Output State: **If `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. Then, if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.**
