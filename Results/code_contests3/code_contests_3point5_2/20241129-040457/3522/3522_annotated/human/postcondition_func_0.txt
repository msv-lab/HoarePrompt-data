The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a range of values based on user input, modifies the value `a` based on whether it is odd or even, calculates a result based on `a`, and prints the result. If `a` is odd, it decreases by 9 and sets `c` to 1. The final output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it is the result of `a / 4 + c`. The function does not return any value.
