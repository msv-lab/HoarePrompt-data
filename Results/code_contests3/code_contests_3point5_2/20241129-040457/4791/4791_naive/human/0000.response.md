Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly set the levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic in the program is incorrect and does not follow the constraints provided. The program does not output the levels of the passages in a way that ensures the number of times passing through a passage is always even. 

Here is an example where the program fails:
Input:
3

Output:
1 2
1

Explanation:
For N = 3, the correct output should be:
1 1
1

The correct levels for the passages connecting Room 1 and Room 2, Room 1 and Room 3, and Room 2 and Room 3 should be 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The program's output does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
