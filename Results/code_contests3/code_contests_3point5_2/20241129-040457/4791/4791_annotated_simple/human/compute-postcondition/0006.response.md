Example Answer:
The binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated, reversed, and then the position of the least significant set bit (1) is found. The initial value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2, which in binary is `10`. When reversed, it becomes `01`, and the least significant set bit is at position 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` reversed is 1.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` reversed is 1**
