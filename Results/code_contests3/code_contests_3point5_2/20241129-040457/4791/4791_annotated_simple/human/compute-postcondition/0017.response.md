Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` needs to be incremented by 2 for the loop to execute another time. The output value is the position of the first set bit (1) when j + 1 is converted to binary, reversed, and then searched for the first occurrence of '1'.**
