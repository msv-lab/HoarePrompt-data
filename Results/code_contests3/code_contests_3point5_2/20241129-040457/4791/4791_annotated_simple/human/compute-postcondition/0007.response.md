According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `j` should be 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` reversed is 1**
