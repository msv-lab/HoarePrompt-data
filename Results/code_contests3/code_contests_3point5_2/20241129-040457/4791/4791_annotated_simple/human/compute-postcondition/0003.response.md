According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The value of `N` does not affect the loop execution. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0**
