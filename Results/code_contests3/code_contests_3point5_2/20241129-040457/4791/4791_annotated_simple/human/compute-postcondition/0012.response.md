According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed determines the range of the loop. Since `n` can be between 0 and 498, it means that for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0. The position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed should also be determined. 
State: **Output State: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed**.
