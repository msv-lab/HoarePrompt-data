Example Answer: 
`n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` needs to be adjusted to a value other than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, after execution, `n` will have a value between 1 and 499. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 499**
