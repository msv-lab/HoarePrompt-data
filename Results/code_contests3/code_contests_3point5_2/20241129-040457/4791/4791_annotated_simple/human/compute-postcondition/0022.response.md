Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 and then its binary representation is reversed, after which the position of the least significant set bit (1) is found and incremented by 1. The initial values of `N`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 497, `j` is 0.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 497, `j` is 0**
