According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed, and the position of the next least significant set bit in the reversed binary representation of `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0**
