According to the code snippet, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. Since the loop increments `j` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `j` must be 2.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 497, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 1**
