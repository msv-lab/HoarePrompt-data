According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be a value other than 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, for the loop to execute the first time `n` needs to be adjusted to a value other than 0**
