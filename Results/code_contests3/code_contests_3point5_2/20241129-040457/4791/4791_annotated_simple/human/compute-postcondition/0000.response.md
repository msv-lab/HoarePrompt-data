Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The value of `N` is between 2 and 500, so after execution, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500**
