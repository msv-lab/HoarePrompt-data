According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a value between 1 and 497, `j` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 497, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
