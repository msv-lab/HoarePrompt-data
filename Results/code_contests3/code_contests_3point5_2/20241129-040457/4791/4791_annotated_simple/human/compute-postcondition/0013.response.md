Example Answer:
`j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed. The code then prints the position of the next least significant set bit in the reversed binary representation of `n`. The value of `j` is between 0 and the number of bits in `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed, and the position of the next least significant set bit in the reversed binary representation of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed, and the position of the next least significant set bit in the reversed binary representation of `n`**
