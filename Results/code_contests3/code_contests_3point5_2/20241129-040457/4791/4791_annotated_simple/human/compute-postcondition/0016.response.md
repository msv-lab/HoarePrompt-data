According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 498, and `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 1 and 498, `j` needs to be incremented by 2 for the loop to execute another time**.
