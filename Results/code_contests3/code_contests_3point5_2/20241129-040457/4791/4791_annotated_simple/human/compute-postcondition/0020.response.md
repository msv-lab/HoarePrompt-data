Output State: N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a value between 0 and 497, `j` is the position of the least significant set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` reversed, and the position of the next least significant set bit in the reversed binary representation of `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0
