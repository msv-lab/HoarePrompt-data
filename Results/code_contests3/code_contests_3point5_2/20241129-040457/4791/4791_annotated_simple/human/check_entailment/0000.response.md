Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly address the problem description. 

1. The program does not set levels to the passages as required in the problem description.
2. The program does not ensure that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even for each room.
3. The logic inside the loop where it prints `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` does not relate to setting levels to passages or ensuring the condition specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
