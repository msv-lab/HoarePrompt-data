Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. After the loop finishes executing, `j` is equal to `n-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, j is equal to n-1 after the loop finishes executing, for the loop to execute again n should be greater than 0.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, j is equal to n-1 after the loop finishes executing, for the loop to execute again n should be greater than 0**
