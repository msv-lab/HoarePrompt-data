Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, decrements it until it reaches 0, and then for each integer in the range from 1 to n, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in its binary representation. The function does not have any return value. The code seems to be missing a proper input validation for the input `n` to ensure it is within the specified range. **
