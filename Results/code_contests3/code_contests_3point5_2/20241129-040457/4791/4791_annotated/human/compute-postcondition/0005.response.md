According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is the value at the end of the previous iteration. Since the code prints the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of j + 1, the next iteration will be determined by the binary representation of j + 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` needs to be determined based on the binary representation of j + 1. The value of `N` does not change throughout the loop.

State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the next value of `j` is determined by the binary representation of j + 1**
