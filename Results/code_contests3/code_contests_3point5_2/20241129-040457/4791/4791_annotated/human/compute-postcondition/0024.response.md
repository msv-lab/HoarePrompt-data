Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decreased by 2, `j` is assigned the new value of `n - 1`. Then, `j + 1` is converted to binary, reversed, and the position of the first '1' is found, incremented by 1, and printed. Depending on the initial value of `N`, the final output may vary. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is decreased by 2, `j` is equal to the new value of `n-1`, the position of the first '1' in the reversed binary representation of `j + 1` incremented by 1 is printed.**
