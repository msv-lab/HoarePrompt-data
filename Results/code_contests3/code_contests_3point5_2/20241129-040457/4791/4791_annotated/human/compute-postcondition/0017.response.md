Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, where `j` is equal to `n`. Since the binary representation of `n+1` contains '1', the position of the rightmost '1' will be found. The output will be the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `n + 1`.
Output State: **Position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `n + 1`**
