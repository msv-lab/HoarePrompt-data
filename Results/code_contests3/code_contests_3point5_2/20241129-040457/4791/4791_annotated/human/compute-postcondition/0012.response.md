According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than 0. Since j is equal to n-1 after the loop finishes executing, for the loop to execute again, n should be greater than 0. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute again `n` should be greater than 0.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to n-1, for the loop to execute again `n` should be greater than 0**
