Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, converted to binary, reversed, finds the index of the first '1' and adds 1 to it. The initial value of `j` is equal to `n`, so the output will depend on the binary representation of `n+1`. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is equal to n, for the loop to execute again `n` should be greater than 0, the output value is the index of the first '1' in the reversed binary representation of `n+1`**
