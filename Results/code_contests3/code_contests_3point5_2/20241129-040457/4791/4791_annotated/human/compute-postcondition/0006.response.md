Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and then the binary representation of j + 1 is reversed. The index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed binary string is found, and 1 is added to get the position of the rightmost set bit. Since the initial state of `j` is unknown, the output state will depend on the value of `j` at runtime.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the next value of `j` is determined by the binary representation of j + 1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is calculated.**
