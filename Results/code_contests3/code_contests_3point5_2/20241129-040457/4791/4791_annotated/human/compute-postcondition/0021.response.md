According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is decreased by 1 and `j` is equal to the previous value of `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` should be greater than 0, `j` should be equal to `n-1`. 
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `j` is equal to the previous value of `n`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`**
