Example Answer:
Initially, `n` is decreased by 4, so `n-1` is equal to the new value of `j`. Then, `j + 1` is converted to binary, the string is reversed, and the position of the first '1' is found (indexing starts from 0). This value is then incremented by 1. The output state is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is decreased by 4, `j` is equal to the new value of `n-1`, and the result of the calculation is printed.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is decreased by 4, `j` is equal to the new value of `n-1`, and the result of the calculation is printed**
