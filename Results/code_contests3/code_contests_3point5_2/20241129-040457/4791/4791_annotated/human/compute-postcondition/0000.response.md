Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The value of `n` can be any string as the input is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input**
