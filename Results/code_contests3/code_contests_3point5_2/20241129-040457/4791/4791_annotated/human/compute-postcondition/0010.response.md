According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is not 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `j` is equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, j is equal to n-1 after the loop finishes executing, for the loop to execute again n should be greater than 0**
