According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the string input `n` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one character). Right before the loop, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is a string input. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should not be an empty string.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is a non-empty string**
