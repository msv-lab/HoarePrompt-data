According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the next value of `j` is determined by the binary representation of j + 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is calculated. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `N` remains between 2 and 500
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 0
- `j` will be increased by 1
- The next value of `j` will be determined by the binary representation of j + 1
- The position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 needs to be calculated for the next iteration

State: **N is between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, the next value of j is determined by the binary representation of j + 1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is calculated for the next iteration**
