#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: N is an integer between 1 and 499, n is 0, j is equal to -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input integer `n`, decrements it until it reaches 0, and then for each integer in the range from 1 to n, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in its binary representation. The function does not have any return value. The code seems to be missing a proper input validation for the input `n` to ensure it is within the specified range.
