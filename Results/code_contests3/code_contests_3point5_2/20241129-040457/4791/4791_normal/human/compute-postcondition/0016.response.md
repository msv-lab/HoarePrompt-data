According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`. Since `j` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration, the next `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2**
