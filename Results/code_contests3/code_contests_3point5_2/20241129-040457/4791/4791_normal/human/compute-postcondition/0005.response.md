According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`, specifically on the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. If the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is at a position greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1 and `j` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` needs to be greater than 1, which means `j + 1` must be an odd number. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1**
