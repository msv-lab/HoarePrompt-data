According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `n` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `n-1`, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2**
