According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, which means that `j` has `n-1` trailing zeros in its binary representation. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start from 0, so it needs to be adjusted to 0. 

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1**
