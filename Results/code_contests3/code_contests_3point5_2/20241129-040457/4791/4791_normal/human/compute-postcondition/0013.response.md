Example Answer:
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, where `j` is 0. Since the rightmost set bit of 1 is at position 0, the output will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, the output of the code is 1**
