Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0 initially, `j + 1` is 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1', and the rightmost set bit is at position 1. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1**
