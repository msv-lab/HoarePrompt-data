According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a non-zero number decreased by 1 before the loop starts, it means that `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute. So, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is now at least 1 and `j` is 0.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
