Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j+1). The binary representation of (j+1) is obtained using the bin() function, then reversed, and the position of the rightmost '1' bit is found using find('1') + 1. Since the initial output is 1, for the loop to execute a second time, n must be greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: the output position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j+1).
Output State: **the output position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j+1)**
