Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `3` in this case (`j + 1` is `3` and its binary representation is `11`). The `[::-1]` reverses the string, and `find('1') + 1` gives the position of the rightmost set bit. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 3.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 3**
