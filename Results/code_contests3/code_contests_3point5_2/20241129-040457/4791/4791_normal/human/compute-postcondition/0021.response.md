According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1` and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1. This means that the binary representation of `j + 1` has a 1 in the rightmost position. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to update `n` to be at least 2, `j` to be 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` to be 1.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
