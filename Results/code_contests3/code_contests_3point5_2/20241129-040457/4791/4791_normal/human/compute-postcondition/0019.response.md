According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `n-1`, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
