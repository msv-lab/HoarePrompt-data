According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `n` is considered True in a boolean context. In Python, any non-zero number is considered True. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be a non-zero number. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **For the loop to execute the first time, `n` should be a non-zero number**
