According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the output is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **the output is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
