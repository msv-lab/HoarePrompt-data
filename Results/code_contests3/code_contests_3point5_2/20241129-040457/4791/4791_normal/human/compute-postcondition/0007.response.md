According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` should be 2.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2**
