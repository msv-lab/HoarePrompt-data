Example Answer: 
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1 initially, `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10', and the rightmost set bit is at position 2. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 2**
