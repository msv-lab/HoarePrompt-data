Example Answer: 
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` is 3 which is represented in binary as 11. The rightmost set bit is at position 1 (from right to left). Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is `n-1`, the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is 1**
