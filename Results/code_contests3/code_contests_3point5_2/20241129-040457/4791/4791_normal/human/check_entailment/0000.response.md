Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The code does not set levels to the passages as required in the problem. The code seems to be printing some binary representation related values which do not align with the problem description of setting levels to passages between rooms. Additionally, the output hints do not match the actual behavior of the code, further confirming that the code does not follow the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
