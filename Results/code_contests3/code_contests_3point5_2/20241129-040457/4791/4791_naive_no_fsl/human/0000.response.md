Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The program uses the `bin()` function to convert the integer `j + 1` to binary and then finds the position of the last '1' in the binary representation to determine the level of the passage. This logic does not guarantee that the number of times a passage is crossed will always be even when leaving and returning to a room.

For example, for input `3`, the output should be:
```
1 1
1
```
However, the program's output for this input is:
```
1
1
1
```
This means that the program does not satisfy the condition specified in the problem description for this case, making it incorrect.
