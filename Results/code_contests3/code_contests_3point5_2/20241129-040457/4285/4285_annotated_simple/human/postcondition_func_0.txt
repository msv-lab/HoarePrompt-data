The function accepts a positive integer n, extracts the alphabetic characters, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse. It returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. The function does not handle cases where n is not a string containing alphabetic characters, and it does not consider special characters or numeric values in the comparison.
