Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. The program takes a positive integer `n` as input, converts it to lowercase (which is not needed as `n` is an integer, not a string), and then checks if the lowercase version of `n` is a palindrome. This is not related to the task of finding the n-th even-length positive palindrome number.

The program should generate the n-th even-length palindrome number by following the pattern of increasing even-length palindrome numbers, such as 11, 22, 33, ..., 88, 99, 1001, etc.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
