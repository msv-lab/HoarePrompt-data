Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to convert the positive integer `n` into a string and then converts each character to lowercase if it is an alphabet. Since `n` is not a string to begin with, the code will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer greater than 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0**
