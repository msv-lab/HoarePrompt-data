The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, if the positive integer `n` is equal to its reverse, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return True if `n` is equal to its reverse. If `n` is not equal to its reverse, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns `True` if n is equal to its reverse. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
