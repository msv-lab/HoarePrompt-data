#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.**
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the positive integer 'x' is equal to its reverse, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and converts n to a string, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts all characters to lowercase, and then checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse. It returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases or missing functionality: The function does not handle cases where n is not a valid positive integer.
