The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and converts n to a string, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts all characters to lowercase, and then checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse. It returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False. Potential edge cases or missing functionality: The function does not handle cases where n is not a valid positive integer.
