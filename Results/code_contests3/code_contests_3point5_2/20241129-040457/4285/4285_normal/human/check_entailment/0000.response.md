Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given code does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` seems to be checking if a given string is a palindrome, not finding the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. The code does not handle the logic to generate the n-th even-length palindrome number. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
