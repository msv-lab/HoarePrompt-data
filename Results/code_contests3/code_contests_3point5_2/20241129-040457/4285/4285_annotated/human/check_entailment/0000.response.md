Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the code in the function does not do that. It tries to convert the input integer `n` into lowercase letters which is not necessary for finding a palindrome number. Additionally, the code tries to iterate over an integer which causes an error.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
