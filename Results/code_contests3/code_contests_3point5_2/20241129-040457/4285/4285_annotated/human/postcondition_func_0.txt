The function `func_1` is supposed to accept a positive integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000. However, the code contains an error where it tries to iterate over an integer causing a 'int' object is not iterable error. Therefore, the actual functionality of the function is that it fails to execute due to trying to iterate over an integer, leading to an 'int' object is not iterable error.
