Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Additionally, it does not import the necessary library `numpy` to use the `np.abs()` function. The program should use `input()` instead of `raw_input()` to take input in Python 3. Also, the program should import numpy as `import numpy as np`.

Furthermore, the program calculates the minimum distance incorrectly. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum element in the input list `a`, which is not the minimum distance that AtCoDeer needs to travel. The correct approach would be to sort the list `a` and then calculate the distance between the first and last elements of the sorted list.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
