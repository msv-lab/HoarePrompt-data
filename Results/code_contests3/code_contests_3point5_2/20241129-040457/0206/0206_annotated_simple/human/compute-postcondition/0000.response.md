Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string. The variables `a_i` are not affected, and their values are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
