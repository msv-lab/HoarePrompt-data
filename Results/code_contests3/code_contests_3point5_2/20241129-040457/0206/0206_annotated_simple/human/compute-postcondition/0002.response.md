Example Answer:
The `ans` variable is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The values in list `a` are integers between 0 and 1000. Therefore, the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values will also be between 0 and 1000. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, a is a list containing the input values split by spaces, ans is an integer between 0 and 1000**
