Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description. Instead, it calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list of house coordinates. This does not correspond to the travel distance that AtCoDeer needs to cover to deliver gifts to all houses. The program should find the minimum distance to be traveled by considering the distances between adjacent houses on the street. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
