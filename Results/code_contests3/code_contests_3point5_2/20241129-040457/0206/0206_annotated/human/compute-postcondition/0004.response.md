The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process a list of integers `a_i` values for 1 <= i <= N, where N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the `a_i` values are integers between 0 and 1000. The function does some processing on these values internally and does not return any specific output.
