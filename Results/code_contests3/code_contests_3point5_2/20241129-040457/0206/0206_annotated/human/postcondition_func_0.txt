The function `func` reads a positive integer `N` from the input and then reads a list of integers `a` of length `N`. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using numpy functions, and prints the result. The function does not return any specific output. The code processing is dependent on the input N and the values in list `a`.
