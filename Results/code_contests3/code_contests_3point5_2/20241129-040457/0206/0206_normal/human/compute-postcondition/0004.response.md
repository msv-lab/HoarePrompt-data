The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output the total number of houses in a neighborhood. The function should consider the constraints that N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and a_i is an integer for each house i, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the total number of houses in the neighborhood based on the given constraints.
