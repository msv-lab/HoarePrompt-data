Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value stored in the variable `ans`. Without information on how `ans` is calculated or updated, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, a_i is an integer for each house i, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, a is a list of strings.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, a_i is an integer for each house i, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, a is a list of strings**
