Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. Since the list contains strings, we cannot directly apply the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions. Therefore, the code will result in an error. The initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, a_i is an integer for each house i, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, a is a list of strings**
