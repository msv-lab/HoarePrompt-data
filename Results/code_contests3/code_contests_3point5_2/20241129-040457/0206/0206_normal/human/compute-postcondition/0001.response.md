Example Answer:
The input is split based on spaces and stored in list `a`. Since the input format is not explicitly mentioned, we assume it is a space-separated list of integers. Therefore, each element of list `a` will be a string representation of an integer. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, a_i is an integer for each house i, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, a is a list of strings**
