Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the minimum distance to be traveled by finding the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum house numbers. It follows the problem description for all potential cases as it handles the input of N houses along with their coordinates and calculates the minimum distance to be traveled. The output hints also agree with the code as they describe the same logic implemented in the program. Therefore, based on the code, the problem description, and the output hints, the code is correct.
