Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum distance to be traveled by AtCoDeer. The program is simply finding the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum house coordinates, which does not necessarily give the minimum distance to be traveled. This approach only works if AtCoDeer starts and ends at the houses with the maximum and minimum coordinates respectively, which is not guaranteed. A correct solution would involve sorting the house coordinates and calculating the minimum distance based on the sorted order.
