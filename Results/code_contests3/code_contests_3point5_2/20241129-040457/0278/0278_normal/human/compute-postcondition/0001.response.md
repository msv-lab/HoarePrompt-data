Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of floats obtained by splitting the input. Similarly, `b` is assigned the list of floats obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. ai and bi are lists of integers with length n such that 1 <= ai[i] <= 100 and 0 <= bi[i] <= 100 for 0 <= i < n; `a` is a list of floats, `b` is a list of floats.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. ai and bi are lists of integers with length n such that 1 <= ai[i] <= 100 and 0 <= bi[i] <= 100 for 0 <= i < n; `a` is a list of floats, `b` is a list of floats**
