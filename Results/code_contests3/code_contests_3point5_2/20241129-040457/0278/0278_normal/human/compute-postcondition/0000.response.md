Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the values are integers, `n` and `V` are now integers. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000. ai and bi are lists of integers with length n such that 1 <= ai[i] <= 100 and 0 <= bi[i] <= 100 for 0 <= i < n.**
