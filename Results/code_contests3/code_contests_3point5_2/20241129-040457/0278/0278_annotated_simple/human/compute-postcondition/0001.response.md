Example Answer:
The input values are split and converted to float numbers and assigned to lists `a` and `b`. The previous values of variables `n` and `V` are positive integers, and they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers, lists `a` and `b` are filled with float numbers.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers, lists `a` and `b` are filled with float numbers**
