Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values for n, V, ai, and bi, calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked based on the given ingredients and proportions, and then outputs the result. The program uses lambda functions and the reduce function to efficiently calculate the result. It ensures that the volume of soup cooked is within the range of 0 to V liters as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
