Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly reads the input, calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given ingredients and proportions, and outputs the result with a relative or absolute error less than 10^-4. The program uses the reduce function along with lambda functions to calculate the minimum proportion of ingredients required for each iteration and then computes the total volume of soup based on the available ingredients and the volume of the pan. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
