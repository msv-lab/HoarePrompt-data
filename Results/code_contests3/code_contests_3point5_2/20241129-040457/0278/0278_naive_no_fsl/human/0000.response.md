Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program takes the input values, calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given proportions and ingredient quantities, and outputs the result with the required precision. The program uses the reduce function to iteratively calculate the minimum proportion of ingredients available and then determines the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases within the specified constraints.
