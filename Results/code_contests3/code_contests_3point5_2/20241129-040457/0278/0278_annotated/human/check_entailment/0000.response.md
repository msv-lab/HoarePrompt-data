Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for `n`, `V`, `ai`, and `bi`, and then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given proportions and available ingredients. The program uses the `map`, `reduce`, and `zip` functions along with mathematical operations to determine the volume of soup. The final result is printed with a relative or absolute error less than 10^-4, as specified in the problem description. The program ensures that the amount of soup cooked can be between 0 and V litres, satisfying the requirements of the problem.
