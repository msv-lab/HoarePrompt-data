Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `V` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000**
