Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `n` is the input integer. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of these two values. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`**
