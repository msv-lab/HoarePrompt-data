Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, so `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I' for the loop to execute one more time**
