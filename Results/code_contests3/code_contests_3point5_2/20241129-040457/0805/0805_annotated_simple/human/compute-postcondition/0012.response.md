Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is already determined, and `n` is an input integer. Therefore, after execution, `added_index` will be the sum of these two values. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I' for the loop to execute one more time**
