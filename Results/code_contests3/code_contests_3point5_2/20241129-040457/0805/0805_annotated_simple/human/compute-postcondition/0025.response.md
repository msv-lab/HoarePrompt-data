Functionality: **The function takes an integer input `n` and a string `strings`, shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet (wrapping around if needed), and prints the resulting string `new_strings`. The function does not return any value.** 

The functionality described aligns with the annotations provided, covering the basic operation of the function. However, it would be useful to note that the function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases explicitly. For instance, there is no validation for the input `n` to ensure it is within a valid range, and the function assumes the input string `strings` only contains uppercase letters. Additionally, there is no error handling if the input format is incorrect, such as providing a non-integer value for `n`.
