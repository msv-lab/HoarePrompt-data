Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the character at position 8 in the string `letters`, which is 'I'. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I'**
