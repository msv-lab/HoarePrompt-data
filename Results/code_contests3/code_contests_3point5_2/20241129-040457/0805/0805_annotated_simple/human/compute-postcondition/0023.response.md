Example Answer:
Each character in `strings` is replaced by the character at the corresponding index in `letters`. Since `letters` contains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', each character in `strings` is replaced by the character at that index in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters at the new indices in `letters` for each character in `strings`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains the characters at the new indices in `letters` for each character in `strings`**
