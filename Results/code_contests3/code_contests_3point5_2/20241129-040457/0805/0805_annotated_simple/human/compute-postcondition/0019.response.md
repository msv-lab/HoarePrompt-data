Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. The value of `added_index` can be any integer, and the remainder of the division by 26 will be the value of `new_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is appended with the character at the new index in `letters`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I', `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is appended with the character at the new index in `letters`, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I', `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
