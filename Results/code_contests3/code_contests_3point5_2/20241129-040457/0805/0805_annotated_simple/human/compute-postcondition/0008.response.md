Example Answer:
`new_index` is calculated as the result of `(index + n) % 26`. The character at position `new_index` in the string `letters` is assigned to `new_s`. Assuming `index` is 3, `n` is 5, then `added_index` would be 8, and `new_index` would be 8 % 26 which is 8. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters`**
