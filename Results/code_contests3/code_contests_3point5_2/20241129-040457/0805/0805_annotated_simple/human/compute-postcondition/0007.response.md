Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. The value of `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`. As `letters` contains 26 characters, the modulo operation ensures that `new_index` will always be in the range of 0 to 25. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters', `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
