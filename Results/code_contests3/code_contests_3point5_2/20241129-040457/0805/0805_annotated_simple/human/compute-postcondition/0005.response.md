Example Answer: 
The variable `index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, which is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The values of `n`, `strings`, and `new_strings` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is not empty, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters'**
