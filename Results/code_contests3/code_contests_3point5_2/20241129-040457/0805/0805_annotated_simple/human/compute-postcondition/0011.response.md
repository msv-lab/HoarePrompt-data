Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value of the index of character `s` in the string `letters`. The value of `s` is not specified, but assuming `s` is a character in the string `letters`, `index` will be the index of that character. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I' for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` still has characters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is not empty, `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position 8 in the string `letters', `new_strings` is appended with 'I' for the loop to execute one more time**
