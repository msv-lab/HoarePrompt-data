Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of shifts, and a string `strings` which consists of uppercase English letters. It then iterates over each character in the input string, calculates the new index by shifting the character by `n` positions in alphabetical order, and constructs a new string `new_strings` with the shifted characters.

The program correctly follows the problem description by shifting each character of the input string by `n` positions in alphabetical order. It ensures that the shifted characters wrap around from 'Z' to 'A' if needed. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
