Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes an integer N and a string S as input.
2. It correctly shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order as described in the problem description.
3. It handles the edge case where N is 0 and returns the input string S unchanged.
4. It handles the edge cases where the input string S contains uppercase English letters only.
5. The program uses the modulo operator to ensure that the shifting wraps around from 'Z' back to 'A' as needed.
6. The program correctly outputs the resulting string after shifting each character of S by N.
