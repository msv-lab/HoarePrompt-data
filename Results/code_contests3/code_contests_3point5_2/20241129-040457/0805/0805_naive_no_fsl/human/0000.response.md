Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N as input to shift each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order. It then correctly calculates the new index after shifting and generates the resulting string by concatenating the shifted characters. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle cases where the shifted index goes beyond the alphabet. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all possible inputs within the given constraints, the program produces the correct output.
