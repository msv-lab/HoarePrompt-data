Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are dependent on the initial state, so the value of `new_index` will vary between 0 and 25. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the first character of `S` in the English alphabet, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the first character of `S` in the English alphabet, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`**
