Example Answer:
`new_strings` is assigned an empty string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, letters is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; new_strings is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, letters is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; new_strings is an empty string**
