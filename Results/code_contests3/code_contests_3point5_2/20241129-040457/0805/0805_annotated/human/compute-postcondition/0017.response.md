Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the value of the index of character `s` in the `letters` string. Since `s` is a character from `S`, it can be any uppercase English letter. The index of `s` in the `letters` string will determine the position of the character in the English alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string consisting of characters from `letters` based on the calculations, `strings` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `s` is the next character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the next character of `S` in the English alphabet, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is in the range of 0 to 25 inclusive, `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at position `new_index` for the loop to execute one more time.
