Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at position `new_index` in the `letters` string. The value of `new_index` is calculated as the result of `(index + N) % 26` where `index` is the position of the next character of `S` in the English alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string consisting of characters from `letters` based on the calculations, `strings` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `s` is the next character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the next character of `S` in the English alphabet, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the result of `(index + N) % 26`, and `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at position `new_index`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string consisting of characters from `letters` based on the calculations, `strings` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `s` is the next character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the next character of `S` in the English alphabet, `added_index` is the result of `index + N`, `new_index` is the result of `(index + N) % 26`, and `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at position `new_index`**
