Example Answer:
`index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, where `letters` contains all uppercase English letters. Since `s` is the first character in the string `S`, the index of that character in `letters` will be the same as its position in the English alphabet. Therefore, `index` will be the position of the first character of `S` in the English alphabet. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character in the string `S`, `index` is the position of the first character of `S` in the English alphabet**
