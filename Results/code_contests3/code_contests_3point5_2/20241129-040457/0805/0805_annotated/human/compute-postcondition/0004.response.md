According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `strings`. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the start, new_strings is an empty string does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, strings must be a non-empty string, and s is the first character in the string S.
State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character in the string `S`**
