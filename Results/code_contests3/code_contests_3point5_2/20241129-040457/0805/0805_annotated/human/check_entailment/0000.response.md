Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer N and a string S as input. It then shifts each character in the string S by N positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if needed. The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description. It calculates the new index of the shifted character correctly and prints the resulting string as required.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately and always produces the correct output for the given inputs.
