Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `added_index` is the sum of index and N, and since N is between 0 and 26, the possible values of `added_index` can range from 0 to 52. Therefore, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The possible values of `new_index` are between 0 and 25. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the character 'S' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is the remainder when added_index is divided by 26.
