Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in the string `letters`. The value of `new_index` is the sum of `index` and `N`, where `index` is the index of the next character in `strings` in the string `letters`. As `N` is between 0 and 26, `new_index` will be between 0 and 25. Therefore, the letter at index `new_index` in `letters` will be assigned to `new_s`.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the next character in 'strings' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is between 0 and 25, new_s is the new character based on the shifted alphabet**
