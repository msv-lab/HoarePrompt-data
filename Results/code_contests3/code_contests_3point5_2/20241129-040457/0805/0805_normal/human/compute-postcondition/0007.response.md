Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of the first character in `S` in the English alphabet, and `n` is an integer between 0 and 26. Therefore, after execution, `new_index` will be the remainder of `(index + n)` divided by 26. Since `index` and `n` are known, the exact value of `new_index` can be calculated based on these values.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S, index is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet, added_index is the result of index + n, new_index is the remainder of (index + n) divided by 26**
