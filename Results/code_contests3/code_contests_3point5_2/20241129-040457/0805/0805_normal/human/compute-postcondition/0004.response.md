According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the length of S is greater than 0 and s is the first character in the string S. 
State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S**
