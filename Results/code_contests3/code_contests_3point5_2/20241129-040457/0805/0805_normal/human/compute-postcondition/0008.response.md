Example Answer:
new_s is assigned the value of the letter at position new_index in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. The value of new_index is the result of (index + n) % 26. The previous values of N, S, letters, new_strings, s, index, added_index, and new_index are determined by the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S, index is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet, added_index is the result of index + n, new_index is the remainder of (index + n) divided by 26, new_s is the letter corresponding to new_index.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S, index is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet, added_index is the result of index + n, new_index is the remainder of (index + n) divided by 26, new_s is the letter corresponding to new_index**
