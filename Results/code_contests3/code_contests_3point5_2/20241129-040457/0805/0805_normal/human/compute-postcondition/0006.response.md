Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet and `n` is an integer between 0 and 26. The value of `added_index` will depend on the initial values of `index` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S, index is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet, added_index is the result of index + n.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time the length of S is greater than 0, s is the first character in the string S, index is the index of the first character in the string S in the English alphabet, added_index is the result of index + n**
