Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` is between 0 and 26, so `n` will also fall within that range. The state of variable `S` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4**
