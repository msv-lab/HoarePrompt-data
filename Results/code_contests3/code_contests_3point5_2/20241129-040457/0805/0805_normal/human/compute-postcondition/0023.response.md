Example Answer:
The code prints the new string generated by shifting each letter in S by N positions in the alphabet. The values of N, S, and letters are not changed during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the shifted string generated by the code.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is the shifted string generated by the code**
