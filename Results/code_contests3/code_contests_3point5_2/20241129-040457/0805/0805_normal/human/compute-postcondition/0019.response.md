Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. Since `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `N`, and `index` is the index of the next character in 'letters', the value of `new_index` ranges from 0 to 25 based on the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the next character in 'strings' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is the remainder when added_index is divided by 26, new_s is the new character based on the shifted alphabet, new_index is between 0 and 25.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the next character in 'strings' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is between 0 and 25, new_s is the new character based on the shifted alphabet**
