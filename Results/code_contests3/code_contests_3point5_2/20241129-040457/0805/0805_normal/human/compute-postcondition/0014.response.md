Example Answer: 
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `letters` contains the uppercase English letters. The value of `N` will determine the shift in the alphabet, `S` is the original uppercase English letter, `index` is the position of `S` in `letters`, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `N`, and `new_index` is the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the character 'S' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is the remainder when added_index is divided by 26, new_s is the new character based on the shifted alphabet.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, letters is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is a string containing the new characters generated by the loop, index is the index of the character 'S' in the string 'letters', added_index is the sum of index and N, new_index is the remainder when added_index is divided by 26, new_s is the new character based on the shifted alphabet.**
