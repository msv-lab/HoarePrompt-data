Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input. It shifts each character of `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet and outputs the resulting string. The code correctly handles shifting each character in the string by the given number of positions. It also correctly loops back to the beginning of the alphabet if the shift exceeds 26. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases. The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code.
