Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the characters of `x`. The conditions for the loop to execute remain the same as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, where tem holds the integer value of `x` with even length and equal count of '4's and '7's, and tem is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, where tem holds the integer value of `x` with even length and equal count of '4's and '7's, and tem is greater than or equal to `n`**.
