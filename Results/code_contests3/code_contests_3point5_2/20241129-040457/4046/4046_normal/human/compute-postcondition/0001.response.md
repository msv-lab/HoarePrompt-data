Example Answer: 
`l` is assigned the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is assigned the integer value 4444477777. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is an input integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
