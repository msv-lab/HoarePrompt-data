Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` should have an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, which is greater than or equal to `n`. After the execution, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, the length of the string representation of n plus 1 is odd, ans is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and tem, tem holds the integer value of x with even length and equal count of '4's and '7's, tem is greater than or equal to n.**
