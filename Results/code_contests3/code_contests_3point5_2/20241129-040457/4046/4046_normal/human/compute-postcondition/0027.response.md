Output State: **`n` is an input integer where the length of its string representation plus 1 is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, where `tem` holds the integer value of `x` with an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` has an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, and the length of the string representation of `x` is even, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is derived from `n` and the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal. `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string representation of `x`.**
