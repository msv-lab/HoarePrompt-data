Postcondition: ***`n` has a string representation length plus 1 which is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `tem` holds the integer value of `x` with an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` has an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, the length of the string representation of `x` is even, `l` is adjusted to meet the loop range condition for the next iteration, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is at least 2, `x` has an equal count of '7's and '4's, `tem` is updated after joining the characters of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is less than or equal to `l+1`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`***
