Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, where `tem` holds the integer value of `x` with even length and equal count of '4's and '7's, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`**
