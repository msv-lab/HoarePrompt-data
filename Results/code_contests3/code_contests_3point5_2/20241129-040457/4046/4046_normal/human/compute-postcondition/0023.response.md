Output State: **`n` is an input integer where the length of its string representation plus 1 is odd. `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, where `tem` holds the integer value of `x` with an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The loop will not execute if the length of the string representation of `x` is odd. If that's the case, `ans` will remain 4444477777.**
