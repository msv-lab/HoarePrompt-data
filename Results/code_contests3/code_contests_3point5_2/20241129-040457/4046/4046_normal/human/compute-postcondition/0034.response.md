Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. The conditions for updating `ans` involve `tem`, which holds the integer value of `x` with an even length and an equal count of '4's and '7's, and `tem` being greater than or equal to `n`. Since specific values of `x` and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where the length of its string representation plus 1 is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer where the length of its string representation plus 1 is odd, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`**
