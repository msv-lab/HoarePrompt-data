Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a positive integer n as input and finds the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. It iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing lengths starting from the length of n until 10. It then checks if the number of 4's and 7's in the combination are equal, and if the number obtained is greater than or equal to n. It keeps track of the minimum number found and prints it at the end.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all cases where the input is a positive integer. It generates the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n as required.
