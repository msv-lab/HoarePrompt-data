Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies super lucky numbers that are greater than or equal to the input number 'n'. It generates super lucky numbers by iterating through possible lengths of the number and all combinations of '4' and '7' digits. It then checks if the number of '4's is equal to the number of '7's. The program finds the least super lucky number that meets the criteria. Since the code covers all possible cases and generates the correct output for each case, the program is correct.
