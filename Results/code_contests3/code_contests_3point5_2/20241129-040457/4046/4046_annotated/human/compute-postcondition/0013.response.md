According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `i`. If `l` is less than 10, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0, `ans` is 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, and `i` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` should be less than 10 and `i` should still be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is greater than 0**.
