According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0 and less than 10, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, and `i` is greater than 0 need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be less than 10 and `x` should be a product of '74' repeated `i` times.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is less than 10, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i` times**.
