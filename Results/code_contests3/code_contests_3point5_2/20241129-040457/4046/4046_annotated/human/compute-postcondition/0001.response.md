Example Answer: 
`l` is assigned the value of the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is assigned the value 4444477777. Since `n` is a positive integer, the length of its string representation can be calculated. The value of `ans` remains constant. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
