Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The initial value of `ans` is 4444477777, and the value of `tem` is unknown. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` depends on the value of `tem`. 
Output State: **Error, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than 0**
