Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is less than 10, `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times with an equal number of '7' and '4' characters, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program maintains all the initial conditions stated above after the if statement executes.***
