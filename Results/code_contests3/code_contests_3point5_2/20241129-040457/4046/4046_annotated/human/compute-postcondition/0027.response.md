Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after converting it from a string. The value of `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i` times, where the number of occurrences of '7' is equal to the number of occurrences of '4'. Therefore, the number represented by `x` when converted to an integer and stored in `tem` maintains this property. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is less than 10, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i` times. The number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`.**
