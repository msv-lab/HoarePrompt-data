According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the beginning, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0. Also, `l` is an even number greater than 0 does not guarantee the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is less than 10. Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `l` is less than 10, `i` is greater than 0**
