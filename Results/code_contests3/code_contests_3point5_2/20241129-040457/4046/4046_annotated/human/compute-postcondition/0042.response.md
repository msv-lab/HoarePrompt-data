Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 10, for the loop to execute, `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains the minimum value between 4444477777 and the initial `tem`, `i` remains greater than 0, and all other variables maintain their initial values.**
