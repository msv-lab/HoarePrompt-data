According to the code, the loop will execute when `i` is less than 10 and is incremented by 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, `tem` all have specific requirements to be met for the loop to execute again. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, for the loop to execute, `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters.**
