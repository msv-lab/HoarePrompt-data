Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining the characters of `x`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, for the loop to execute `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, for the loop to execute `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters.**
