Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 4444477777, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `ans` will be updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute `l` is less than 10, `i` is greater than 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute `l` is less than 10, `i` is greater than 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
