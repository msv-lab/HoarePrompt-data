Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `4444477777` and `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of `x`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, so after execution, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, for the loop to execute `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters, and after entering the if condition `tem >= n`, the program state remains the same as the precondition but with the added condition that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the updated minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, for the loop to execute `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters, and after entering the if condition `tem >= n`.**
