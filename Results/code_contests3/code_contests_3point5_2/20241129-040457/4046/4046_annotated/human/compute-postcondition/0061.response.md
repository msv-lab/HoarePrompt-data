Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `n`, `i` is less than 8, `x` is a product of '74' repeated `i+2` times, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4', `tem` is the integer value of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `x` consists of an equal number of '7' and '4' characters. The loop will update `ans` to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem` for each valid iteration of the loop. After all iterations have completed, `ans` will hold the minimum valid value satisfying the conditions imposed by the loop.**
