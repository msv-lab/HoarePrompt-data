Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` plus 1 (an even number), `ans` is 4444477777. If the length of the string representation of `n` is odd, then `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `l`, and `ans`.***
