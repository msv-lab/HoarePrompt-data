Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than 0 and incremented by 1, an error occurs if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of `x` without spaces. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program maintains the same state with the described initial conditions.***
