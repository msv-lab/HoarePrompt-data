According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10. Since the loop increments `i` by 2, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` should be less than 10. Therefore, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0 and less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 10**
