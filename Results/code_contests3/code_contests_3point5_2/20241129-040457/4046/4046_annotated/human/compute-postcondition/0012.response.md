Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number greater than 0, `ans` is 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`. The loop to execute `l` is less than 10, and `i` is greater than 0.***
