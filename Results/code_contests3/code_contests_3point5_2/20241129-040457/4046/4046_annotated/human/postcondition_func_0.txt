The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, calculates the length of the string representation of `n`, adjusts the length to be even if it is odd, and then iterates through various combinations of '7' and '4' characters to find the minimum integer greater than or equal to `n` that has an equal number of '7' and '4' characters. Finally, it prints this minimum integer as the output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
