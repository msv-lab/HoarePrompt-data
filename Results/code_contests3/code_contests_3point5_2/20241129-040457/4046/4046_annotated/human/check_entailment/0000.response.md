Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer input `n`, calculates the length of its string representation, adjusts the length to be even if it is odd, and then iterates through combinations of '7' and '4' characters to find the minimum integer greater than or equal to `n` that has an equal number of '7' and '4' characters. Finally, it prints this minimum integer as the output. This process ensures that the program finds the least super lucky number which is not less than `n`, as required by the problem description.
