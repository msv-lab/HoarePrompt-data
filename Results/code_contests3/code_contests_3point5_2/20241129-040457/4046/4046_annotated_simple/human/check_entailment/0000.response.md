Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an input positive integer `n`, finds the length `l` of its string representation, and then iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' digits of length `i` starting from `l` up to 10. It checks if the number formed has an equal count of '4' and '7', and if it is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates the minimum value found so far in `ans`. Finally, it prints the minimum super lucky number found.

The program ensures that the output is the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to `n`, as required by the problem description. Since it iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' digits, it is guaranteed to find the correct solution for any input `n`.
