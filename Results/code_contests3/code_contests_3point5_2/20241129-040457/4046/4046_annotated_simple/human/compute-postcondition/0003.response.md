Example Answer:
The value of `l` is incremented by 1. As the length of the string representation of `n` is odd, the length `l` will become even after incrementing by 1. The value of `ans` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; l is even; ans is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9; l is even; ans is 4444477777**
