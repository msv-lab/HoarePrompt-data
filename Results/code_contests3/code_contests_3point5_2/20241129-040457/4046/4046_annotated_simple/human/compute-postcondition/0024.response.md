According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the last value of `x` in the loop and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be less than 10.
State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the last value of `x` in the loop and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than 10**
