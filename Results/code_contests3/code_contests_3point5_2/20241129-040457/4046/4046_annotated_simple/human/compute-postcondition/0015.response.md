Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is the integer value converted from `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
