According to the code, the loop will execute for all combinations of '7' and '4' characters of length 12. To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is the next odd number after the current `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is 12, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the last value of `x` in the loop and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute `x` contains only '7' and '4' characters of length 12**
