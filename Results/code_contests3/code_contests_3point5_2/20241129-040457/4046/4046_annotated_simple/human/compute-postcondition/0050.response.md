Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` becomes the next odd number after the current `l`, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and updated `tem`, `i` is set to 12, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the last value of `x` in the loop and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute, `x` contains only '7' and '4' characters of length 12, and `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. Additionally, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then all the mentioned conditions hold true after the if statement executes.***
