Example Answer:
The code converts the string `x` into an integer and assigns it to `tem`. The value of `tem` is dependent on the value of `x`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 2, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
