Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 3, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, if `x` has an equal count of '7' and '4', then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.***
