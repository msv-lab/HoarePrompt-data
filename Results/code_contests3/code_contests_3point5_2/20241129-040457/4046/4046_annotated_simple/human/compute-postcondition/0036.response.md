Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is the total number of iterations of the loop incremented by 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value converted from the last value of `x` in the loop and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is less than 10, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem = int(''.join(x)) if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
