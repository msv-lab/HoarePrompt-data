Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value converted from the string `x`, and `x` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 3, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, `l` is an odd number, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is 3, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is the integer value converted from `x` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
