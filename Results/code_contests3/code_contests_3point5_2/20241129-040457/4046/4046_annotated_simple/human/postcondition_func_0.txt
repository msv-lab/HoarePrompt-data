The function `func` reads a positive integer `n`, calculates the length `l` of its string representation, and iterates through combinations of '7' and '4' to find the minimum number greater than or equal to `n` where the count of '7' equals the count of '4'. This number is then printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
