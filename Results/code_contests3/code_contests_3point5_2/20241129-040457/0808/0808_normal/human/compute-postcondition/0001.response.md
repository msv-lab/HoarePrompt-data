According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of 2 to 999,999. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements all set to True, i is 2 for the loop to execute the first time**
