According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is 3
- The element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True
- `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1000000

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 (excluding the first element) set to False, `i` is 3, the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True, for the loop to execute `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1000000**
