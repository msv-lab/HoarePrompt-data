According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 4.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 (excluding the first element) set to False, i is 4, and the element at index i-1 in list a is True**
