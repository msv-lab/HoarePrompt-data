According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. Since `j` is defined by the range function, it will execute as long as the starting value `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. 

Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute are:
1. The element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True.
2. The starting value `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000.

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 (excluding the first element) set to False, i is 4, and the element at index i-1 in list `a` is True, and `j` is equal to `i ** 2 - 1` and less than 1000000**
