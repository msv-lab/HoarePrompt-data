Example Answer:
The value at index `j` in list `a` is set to False. Since `j` is 8, the element at index 7 in list `a` is set to False. The initial state of list `a` has multiples of 2 set to False, so after executing the code, the element at index 7 becomes False. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 set to False except for the element at index 3 which is now False, i is 4, and j is 8.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 set to False except for the element at index 3 which is now False, i is 4, and j is 8**
