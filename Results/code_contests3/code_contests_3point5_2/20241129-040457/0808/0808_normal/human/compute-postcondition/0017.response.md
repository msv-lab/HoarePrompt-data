Example Answer: 
The value at index `j` in list `a` is set to False. Since `j` is initially 3, `a[3]` is set to False. The loop will continue executing and updating the values of `a` based on the conditions provided in the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with multiples of 2 (excluding the first element) set to False, `i` is 3, the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True, for the loop to execute again `j` starts at `i`, `a[j]` is set to False, `j` is incremented by `i` to `j + i`.**
