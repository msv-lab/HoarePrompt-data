Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list of 1000000 elements with all values set to True, then iterates over the list to mark non-prime indices as False following a specific algorithm. After that, it reads input from the standard input and prints the count of True values in the sublist of `a` from index 1 to the input value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.**
