According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999,999. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the condition related to `j` involves `i`, so `j` should also be updated accordingly. 

State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False, `i` is 1000000, `j` is the next multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 6**.
