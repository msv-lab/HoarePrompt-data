According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. 
State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False, `i` is 3, `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5.**
