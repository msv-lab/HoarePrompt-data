Example Answer:
The list `a` is initialized with 1000000 elements, all set to `True`. This means that `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values all being True. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values all being True.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values all being True**
