According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range specified is valid. In this case, the loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5
- `a[i - 1]` is True, which means `a[2]` is True
- The range condition `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000

State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False, `i` is 3, `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5, `a[2]` is True, for the loop to execute `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000**
