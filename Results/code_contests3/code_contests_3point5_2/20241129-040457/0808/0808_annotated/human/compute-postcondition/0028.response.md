Postcondition: ***`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False, `i` is 1000000, `j` is the next multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 6. All boolean values in list `a` at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 999,999 are set to False if the condition `a[i - 1]` is True.***
