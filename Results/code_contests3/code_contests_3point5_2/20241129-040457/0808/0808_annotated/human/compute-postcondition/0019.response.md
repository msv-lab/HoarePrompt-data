Postcondition: ***`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False. `i` is 3, `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `j` is a multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 5. Additionally, when `a[i - 1]` is True, `n` remains 999,999, `a` remains the same, `i` remains 3, `j` is the next multiple of 2 greater than the current value within the range of `i`, and `a[j]` is False.***
