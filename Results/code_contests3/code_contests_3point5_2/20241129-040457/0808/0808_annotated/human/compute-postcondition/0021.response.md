According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range condition is met. 

1. The loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000.
2. The loop will execute if the range `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 is valid.
3. `j` should be initialized with the next multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 6.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 boolean values with the first two elements being True and the rest being False, `i` is 1000000, `j` is the next multiple of 2 greater than or equal to 6, for the loop to execute `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000 and the range `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 is valid**
