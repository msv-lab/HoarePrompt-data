Functionality: **The function `func` initializes a list of 1000000 boolean values where the first two elements are True (representing prime numbers) and the rest are False (non-prime numbers). It then iterates through the list, marking multiples of each prime number as False. The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in the list up to the specified index. The function does not explicitly return any value and operates independently of external input.**
