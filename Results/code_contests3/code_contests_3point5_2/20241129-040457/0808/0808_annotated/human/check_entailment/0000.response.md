Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It initializes a list of boolean values representing prime numbers up to 999,999. It then marks multiples of each prime number as False. Finally, it reads input from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in the list up to the specified index, which represents the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. The program handles multiple datasets and operates independently of external input.
