Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number 'n'. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently mark all the prime numbers in a boolean array 'a'. Then, it simply counts the number of 'True' values in the array up to the input number 'n'. The logic seems correct and efficient, and there are no obvious edge cases where it would fail to produce the correct output.
