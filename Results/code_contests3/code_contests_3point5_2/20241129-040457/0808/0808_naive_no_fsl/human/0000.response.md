Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly reads an integer `n` and prints the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. It uses the sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit. The algorithm marks all multiples of each prime number as composite, leaving only the prime numbers marked as true in the final array.

The program loops through the input values of `n`, calculates the count of prime numbers up to `n`, and prints the result. The program logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
