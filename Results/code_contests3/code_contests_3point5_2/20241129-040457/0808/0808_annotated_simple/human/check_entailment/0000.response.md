Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads an integer `n` and calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit. The program then prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` as required by the problem description.

The program ensures that the count of prime numbers is calculated accurately for each dataset provided as input. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
