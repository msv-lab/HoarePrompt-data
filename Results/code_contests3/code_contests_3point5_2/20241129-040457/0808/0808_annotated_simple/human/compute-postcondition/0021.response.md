According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop executes when the range in the for loop statement is valid. In this case, the loop can execute if the range in the for loop statement is valid based on the values of `i` and `j`. 

Before the loop starts, since the loop is expected to run with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1`, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to start at `i ** 2 - 1`. Additionally, the loop should stop at index 1000000, so the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to go up to 1000000. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, all elements of list `a` are `True` except for elements from index 2 to 999,999 which are `False`, `i` is 1000001, `j` is i ** 2 - 1, and the element at index 1000000 in `a` is `False`.**
