Example Answer:
The value of the element at index `j` in list `a` is changed to `False`. Since `j` is 1000000000000 - 1, the element at index 999,999 in list `a` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, all elements of list `a` are `True` except for index 2 to 999,999 which are `False`, `i` is 1000000, `j` is 1000000000000 - 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, all elements of list `a` are `True` except for index 2 to 999,999 which are `False`, `i` is 1000000, `j` is 1000000000000 - 1**
