According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000001, `j` is 1000002000001. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `i ** 2 - 1` and greater than or equal to 1000000. So, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, all elements of list `a` are `True` except for elements from index 2 to 999,999 which are `False`, `i` is 1000001, `j` is 999999899999**
