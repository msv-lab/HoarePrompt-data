Example Answer: 
An array `a` of size 1000000 is created with all elements set to `True`. Since `n` can be any integer from 1 to 999,999, the array size is sufficient to hold the values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; array `a` is created with all elements set to `True`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; array `a` is created with all elements set to `True`**
