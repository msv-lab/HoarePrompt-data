According to the code, the loop will start from 2 and go up to 999,999. Before the loop starts, the array `a` is set to all elements being `True`. So, for the loop to execute, `i` should start at 2 and go up to 999,999, and the array `a` should have all elements set to `True`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is created with all elements set to `True`, for the loop to execute `i` starts at 2 and goes up to 999,999**
