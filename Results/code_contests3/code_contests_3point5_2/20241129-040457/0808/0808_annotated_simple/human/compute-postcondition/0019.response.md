Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, all elements of list `a` are `True` except for elements from index 2 to 999,999 which are `False`, `i` is 1000000, `j` is 999,999, and the element at index 1000000 in `a` is `True. If the element at index i-1 in `a` is `True`, then the element at index i in `a` is `False`.***
