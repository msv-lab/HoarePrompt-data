According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and goes up to 999,999 with a step of `i`. 

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is created with all elements set to `True`, `i` starts at 2 and goes up to 999,999, the element at index `i - 1` in `a` is `True`, for the loop to execute `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and goes up to 999,999 with a step of `i`**
