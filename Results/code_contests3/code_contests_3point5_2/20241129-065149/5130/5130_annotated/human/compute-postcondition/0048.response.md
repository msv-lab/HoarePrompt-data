Output State: **Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is defined with an integer value, `i` is 2, all elements in `comps` are assigned a unique value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1 for each unique element, `col` is incremented by 2, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col` (incremented by 2), `j` is updated to a different value than `i`, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to a new value based on the existing value of `j`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute again `j` and `comps[j]` should be updated accordingly and `comps[p[j]]` should remain equal to 0, `j = p[j]` and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
