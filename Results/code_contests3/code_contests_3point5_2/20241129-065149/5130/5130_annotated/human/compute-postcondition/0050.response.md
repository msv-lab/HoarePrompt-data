Postcondition: ***Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, all elements in `comps` are assigned a unique value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1 for each unique element, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is assigned the value of the next element in the sequence `p`. If `comps[i]` is 0 and 'j' is such that `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, then `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.***
