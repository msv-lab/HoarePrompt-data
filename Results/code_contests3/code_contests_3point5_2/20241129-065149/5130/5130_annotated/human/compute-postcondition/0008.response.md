Example Answer:
`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `col` is incremented by 1. The value of `col` is not specified, but `i` is 0, so `comps[0]` is now equal to the new value of `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is defined with an integer value, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is defined with an integer value, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1**
