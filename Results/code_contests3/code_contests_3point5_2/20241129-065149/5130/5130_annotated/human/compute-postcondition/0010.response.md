According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `comps[p[j]]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated value of `col`, so `comps[p[j]]` needs to be equal to 0. Also, `col` is incremented by 1, so `col` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is defined with an integer value, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0**
