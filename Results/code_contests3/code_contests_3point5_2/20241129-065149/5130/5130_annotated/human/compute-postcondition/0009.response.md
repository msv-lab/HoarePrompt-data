Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Error: raw_input() is not defined, `n` is defined with an integer value, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `comps[i]` is equal to the updated value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is 0.
