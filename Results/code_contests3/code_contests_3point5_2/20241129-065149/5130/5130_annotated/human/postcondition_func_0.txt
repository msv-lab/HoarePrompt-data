The function `func` reads input values, processes them to assign unique values to elements in `comps`, and then prints a value based on the conditions. It does not accept any parameters. The returned value is based on the calculated conditions inside the function. The function increments `col` for each unique element in `comps` and updates elements according to loop conditions. If `col` is 1, it prints 0, otherwise it prints `col`. Additionally, if the sum of elements in `b` is 0, it adds 1 to the printed value.
