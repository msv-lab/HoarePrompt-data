Functionality: **The function func reads input values for n, p, and b. It then computes the number of connected components in a graph based on the input sequences p and b. The function prints either 0 or the number of connected components depending on certain conditions. The function does not return any value.** 

The code initializes a list `comps` to keep track of the components, assigns unique values to each component, and counts the number of unique components in the graph. The code then prints either 0 or the number of components based on the conditions `col == 1` and `sum(b) == 0`. If any of the annotations are incorrect, the actual code execution takes precedence.
