Example Answer: 
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `p[j]` is already decreased by 1. Since `p[j]` is equal to 0 initially, after this assignment, `j` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to `col`, `col` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, `comps[i]` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to `col`, `col` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, `comps[i] is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0**
