Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0, `i` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, `p` is a list of integers with each value increased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to `col`, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index accessed in list `p`, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`.***
