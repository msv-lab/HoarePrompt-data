Example Answer: 
`col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is 0, so after execution, `col` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, p is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, comps is a list of n elements initialized to 0, col is 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. comps[i] is equal to 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, p is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, comps is a list of n elements initialized to 0, col is 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. comps[i] is equal to 0**
