According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the input integer. Before the loop starts, the list `p` is provided with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, and `col` is 0. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
