Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements where each element is a unique value between 1 and `n`, `col` is equal to the number of unique elements in `comps`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is the last valid index where `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0. 0 if col == 1 else col + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)**
