Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the input values obtained by splitting the raw input. The values in `p` are decreased by 1, but the specific values in the list are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1**
