Example Answer:
A list `comps` is created with `n` number of elements, each initialized to 0. The value of `n` is based on the input integer provided. The list `p` is not used in this code snippet, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0**
