Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each integer value in the input split by spaces. Since the input is not specified, the exact values in the list `p` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1**
