Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, p is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, comps is a list of n elements with comps[i] updated to col, col is 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, p is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, comps is a list of n elements with comps[i] updated to col, col is 1, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, j is 0**
