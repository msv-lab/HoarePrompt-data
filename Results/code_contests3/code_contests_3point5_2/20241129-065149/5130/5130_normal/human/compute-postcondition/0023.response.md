Example Answer:
`comps[i]` is assigned the value `col`, where `col` is 2. The value of `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the list `comps` will have the value of `col` at index 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to `col`, `col` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index accessed in list `p`, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, `comps[i]` is 2**
