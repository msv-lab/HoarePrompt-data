According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to 2 except for the element at index `i` which is set to 3, `col` is 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute the first time, `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements with each element set to 2 except for the element at index `i` which is set to 3, `col` is 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0**
