Example Answer:
`col` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `p`, and `comps` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each value decreased by 1, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0**
