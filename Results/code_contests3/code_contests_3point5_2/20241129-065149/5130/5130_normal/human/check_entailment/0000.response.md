Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of connected components in a graph based on the input sequences p and b. It then prints either 0 or the number of connected components depending on certain conditions. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the output hints also align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.
