Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values `n`, `p`, and `b` based on certain constraints. It then assigns unique values to elements in `comps` based on the provided logic. Finally, it prints a specific value calculated from `col` and the sum of elements in `b`, with adjustments. The function does not accept any parameters and works with the pre-defined inputs.**
