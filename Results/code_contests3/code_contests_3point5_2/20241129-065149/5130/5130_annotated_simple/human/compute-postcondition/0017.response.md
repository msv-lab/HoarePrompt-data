Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, where `j` is initially assigned the value of `p[j]`. This creates a loop where `j` keeps getting updated based on the values in list `p`. Since the condition for the loop to execute again is that `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, the loop will continue until this condition is met. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` has been updated with `col` at index `j`, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0**
