Example Answer:
The list `p` is created with each element being one less than the corresponding integer value obtained from splitting the raw input. The `raw_input().split()` function splits the input into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers and decremented by 1. The initial state is n is an input integer.
Output State: **n is an input integer, p is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value**
