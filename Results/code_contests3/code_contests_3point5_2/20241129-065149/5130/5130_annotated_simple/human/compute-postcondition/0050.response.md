Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the corresponding input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` contains `n` elements all updated with `col`, `col` is updated to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at a value such that `comps[j]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]` until `comps[p[j]]` is 0.***
