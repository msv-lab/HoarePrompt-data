According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0, `col` is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
