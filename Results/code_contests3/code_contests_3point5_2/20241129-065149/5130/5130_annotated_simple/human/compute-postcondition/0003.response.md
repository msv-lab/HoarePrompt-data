Example Answer:
A list `comps` is created with `n` number of elements, each initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list of `n` elements initialized to 0**
