Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` has the `i`th element updated with `col`, `comps[j]` is updated with `col`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`.
