Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, assuming it was meant to be `input()`, the list `p` is input as a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value, `b` is a mapped list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers with each element being one less than the corresponding input integer value, `b` is a mapped list of integers**
