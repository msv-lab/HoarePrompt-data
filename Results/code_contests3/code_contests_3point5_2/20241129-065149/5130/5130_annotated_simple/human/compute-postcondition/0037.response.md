Example Answer:
The value of `col` is incremented by 1, and `col` was previously updated to 0. Therefore, after execution, `col` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the corresponding input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` contains `n` elements all updated with 1, `col` is updated to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at a value such that `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0**
