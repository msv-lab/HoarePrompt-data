According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition was already satisfied, so the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustments to the states.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` has the `i`th element updated with `col`, `comps[j]` is updated with `col`, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]` for the loop to execute the first time**
