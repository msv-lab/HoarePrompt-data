According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `comps[p[j]]` needs to be equal to 0.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` contains `n` elements, `col` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, `comps` has `i`th element updated with `col`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `comps[j]` is updated with `col`, and `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0**
