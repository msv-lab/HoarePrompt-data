Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the corresponding input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` contains `n` elements all updated with `col`, `col` is updated to 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is at a value such that `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, `comps[i]` is updated with the value of `col`, `comps[p[j]]` is set to 0, `p` is a list of integers, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the corresponding input integer, `i` is 1, `j` is now equal to the updated value of `j` where `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0, and the loop has finished executing.***
