Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements. 

The program first assigns unique values to each element in the `comps` list based on the permutation `p`. Then it checks if all skewers are already in the same cycle (i.e., `col == 1`), in which case no changes are needed and the program prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the number of unique values assigned to `comps` (which represents the number of cycles in the permutation).

Additionally, it adds 1 to the result if the sum of elements in `b` is 0, indicating that reversing any skewer is sufficient to ensure that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement to determine the minimum changes required for the skewers to visit each placement.
