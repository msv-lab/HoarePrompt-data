#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- p is a sequence of integers of length n such that each element pi is an integer and 1 ≤ pi ≤ n.
- b is a sequence of zeros and ones of length n.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    p = [(int(v) - 1) for v in raw_input().split()]
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    comps = [(0) for i in xrange(n)]
    col = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        if comps[i] == 0:
            col += 1
            comps[i] = col
            j = i
            while comps[p[j]] == 0:
                j = p[j]
                comps[j] = col
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is 1 less than the corresponding input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` contains `n` elements all updated with unique values starting from 1, `col` is the total number of unique values assigned to comps, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `j` is such that comps[j] is not equal to 0.
    print(0 if col == 1 else col) + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values `n`, `p`, and `b` based on certain constraints. It then assigns unique values to elements in `comps` based on the provided logic. Finally, it prints a specific value calculated from `col` and the sum of elements in `b`, with adjustments. The function does not accept any parameters and works with the pre-defined inputs.
