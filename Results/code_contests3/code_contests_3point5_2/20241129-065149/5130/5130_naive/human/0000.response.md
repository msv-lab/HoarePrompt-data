Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements in the permutation p and the sequence b that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. The program uses a clever approach to determine the number of connected components in the permutation graph and then adds 1 if the sum of the sequence b is 0. This logic covers all potential cases and satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
