Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The input is expected to be in the form of an arithmetic expression, but the program is trying to read floats directly. This will lead to a ValueError as the program is expecting an arithmetic expression in the input. 

Additionally, the program is counting the occurrences of the entire expression, not just the resulting coordinate after evaluating the arithmetic expression. This will not give the correct output based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
