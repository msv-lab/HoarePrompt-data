According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1**
