According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 1 floating-point number, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `my_list` is still empty. So, for the loop to be executed, the `test_list` must have at least 1 floating-point number, and `i` should be the first number in the list.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers with at least 1 number, `my_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first number in `test_list`**
