According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`, `i`, `e`, and the contents of `test_list`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `m`, `e` is a floating-point number, and `test_list` contains the appended value of `e`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`m` is greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `e` is a floating-point number, `test_list` contains the appended value of `e`**
