According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `test_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `m` being a positive integer ensures that the loop will execute, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is an empty list, the loop will execute**
