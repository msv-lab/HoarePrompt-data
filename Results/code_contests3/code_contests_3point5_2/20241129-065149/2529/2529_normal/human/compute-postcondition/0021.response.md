The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the jump coordinates based on the formula (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function then returns the resulting jump coordinates. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the jump coordinates based on the given formula.
