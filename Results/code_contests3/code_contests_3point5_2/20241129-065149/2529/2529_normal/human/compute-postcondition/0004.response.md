Example Answer:
The value of `e` is appended to the `test_list`. Since `test_list` was initially empty and `e` is a floating-point number, the `test_list` will now contain `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `e`, `e` is a floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `e`, `e` is a floating-point number**
