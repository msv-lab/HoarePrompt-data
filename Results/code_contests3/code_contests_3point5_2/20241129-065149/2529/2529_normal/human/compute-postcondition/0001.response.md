Example Answer:
`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` is a positive integer, but it is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is an empty list**
