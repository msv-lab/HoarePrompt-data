Example Answer:
`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `e` is a floating-point number.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than the current value of `i` plus 1, `e` is a floating-point number**
