Example Answer:
The code prints the count of each unique number in `test_list` separated by spaces. Since `my_list` contains the count of each unique number in `test_list`, the code will print these counts. The values of `m` and `i` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, `my_list` contains the count of each unique number in `test_list`, `i` is the last number in `test_list`**
