Example Answer:
The count of occurrences of the next number `i` in `test_list` is calculated and appended to `my_list`. The updated `my_list` now contains this count. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers with at least 1 number, `my_list` contains the count of the next number in `test_list`, `i` is the next number in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers with at least 1 number, `my_list` contains the count of the next number in `test_list`, `i` is the next number in `test_list`**
