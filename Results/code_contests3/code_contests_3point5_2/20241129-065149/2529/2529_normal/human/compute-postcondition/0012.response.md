Example Answer:
`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `m`, `test_list`, and `e` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, each appended value `e` is a floating-point number, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, each appended value `e` is a floating-point number, `my_list` is an empty list**
