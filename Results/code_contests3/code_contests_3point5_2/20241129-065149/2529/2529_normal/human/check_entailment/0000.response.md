Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description specifies that the jump coordinates are in the form of (a+b)/c, but the code is trying to read floating-point numbers directly without considering the format. This means that the code will not correctly parse the arithmetic expressions provided in the input. For example, if the input is '(99+98)/97', the code will not correctly interpret it as an arithmetic expression and will fail to count the occurrences of the jump coordinates correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle the input format specified in the problem description.
