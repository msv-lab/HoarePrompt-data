The function `func` reads a positive integer `m`, then reads `m` floating-point numbers and stores them in a list `test_list`. It then counts the occurrences of each unique number in `test_list` and stores the counts in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each unique number in `test_list` as a space-separated string.
