Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the problem description. The problem description specifies that the input coordinates are of the form (a+b)/c, but the program reads the input as floats instead of strings representing arithmetic expressions. Additionally, the program calculates the count of occurrences of each float entered, which is not the same as calculating the number of ships that will end up at the same coordinate.

Therefore, the program does not output the correct result as specified in the problem description.
