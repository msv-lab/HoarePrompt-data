According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `test_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `m` is assigned the value of an integer input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`m` is assigned the value of an integer input, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
