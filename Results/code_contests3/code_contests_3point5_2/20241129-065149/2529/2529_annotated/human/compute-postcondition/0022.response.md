Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `m` from the input and then reads `m` floating-point numbers. It stores these numbers in a list `test_list`. It then creates a new list `my_list` that contains the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each element in `test_list` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value.**
