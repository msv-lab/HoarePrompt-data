According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the size of `test_list`. If `test_list` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` being 0 signifies that `test_list` will remain empty, so the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute, `m` should be greater than 0, `test_list` should have at least 1 element, `i` should be updated to the first element of `test_list`, and `e` should be the last float entered via input.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` has at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `test_list`, `e` is the last float entered via input**
