According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must still be greater than 1, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2. Additionally, `e` needs to be assigned a new value from user input and `test_list` should have the new value of `e` appended to it.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1, `e` is assigned the value of `float(input())`, `test_list` has been appended with the new value of `e`**
