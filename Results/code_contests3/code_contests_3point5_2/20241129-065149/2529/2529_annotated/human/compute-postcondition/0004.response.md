Example Answer:
The value of `e` is appended to the `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `test_list` is an empty list, and `e` is an input float. Therefore, after execution, `test_list` will contain the value of `e`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `e` is an input float**
