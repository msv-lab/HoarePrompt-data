According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Since the loop increases `i` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 1 and `i` must be 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
