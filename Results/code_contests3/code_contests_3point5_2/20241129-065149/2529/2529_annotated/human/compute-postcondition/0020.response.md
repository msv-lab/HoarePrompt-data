Example Answer:
The code prints the elements of `my_list` separated by a space. The elements of `my_list` are the count of each element in `test_list`. The initial state states that `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` has at least `m` elements, `i` is the last element of `test_list`, `e` is the last float entered via input, and `my_list` contains the count of each element in `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` has at least `m` elements, `i` is the last element of `test_list`, `e` is the last float entered via input, `my_list` contains the count of each element in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` has at least `m` elements, `i` is the last element of `test_list`, `e` is the last float entered via input, `my_list` contains the count of each element in `test_list`**
