Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is expecting float inputs when the problem description clearly states that the input will be arithmetic expressions in the form of strings. The program should parse the arithmetic expressions and calculate the result to identify the coordinate to which each ship will jump. Since the program does not handle the input format as described in the problem, the correctness is false.
