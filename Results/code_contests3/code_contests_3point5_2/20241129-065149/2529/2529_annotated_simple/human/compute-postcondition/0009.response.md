Example Answer:
The value of `e` is assigned the floating-point number entered by the user. The previous values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the floating-point number entered by the user, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user, `i` should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the floating-point number entered by the user, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user, `i` should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
