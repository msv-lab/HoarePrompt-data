According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 1 and `i` should be increased by 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the floating-point number entered by the user, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be increased by 1**
