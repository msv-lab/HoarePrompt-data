Example Answer: 
The floating-point number `e` entered by the user is appended to the empty list `test_list`. Since `e` is a floating-point number, it is added to the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user**
