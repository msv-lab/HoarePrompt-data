Example Answer:
The floating-point number `e` entered by the user is appended to the `test_list`. The previous values of `test_list` and `e` are unknown, so after execution, the `test_list` now contains the entered floating-point number. 
Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `test_list` contains the floating-point number entered by the user, `e` is the floating-point number entered by the user**
