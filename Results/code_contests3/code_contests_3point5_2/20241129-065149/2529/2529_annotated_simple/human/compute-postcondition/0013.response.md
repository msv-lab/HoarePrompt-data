According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `test_list`. Since `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `my_list` is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least one element after the first iteration. Additionally, the loop will start with `i` being the first element in `test_list`.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` has at least one element after the first iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
