According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `test_list` is an empty list, so it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list**
