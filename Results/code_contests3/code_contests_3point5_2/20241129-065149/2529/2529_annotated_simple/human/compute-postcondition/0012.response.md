Example Answer:
No variables are affected by the code snippet provided. The list `my_list` is initialized as an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` is an empty list**
