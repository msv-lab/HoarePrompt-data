Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. The number of ships is now determined by `m`, where each ship's jump coordinate is given as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c. There are no changes to the initial state other than the assignment of `m`.
Output State: **`m` is the number of ships with jump coordinates specified as (a+b)/c**
