According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `test_list` and `my_list`. If `my_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` has at least one element after the first iteration, `i` is the first element in `test_list`, and `my_list` appends the count of occurrences of the first element `i` in `test_list`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `my_list` must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` has at least 2 elements after the second iteration, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is the second element in `test_list`, `my_list` appends the count of occurrences of the second element `i` in `test_list`**.
