Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `m` representing the number of ships, then reads `m` floating-point numbers as jump coordinates for each ship. It then counts the occurrences of each unique jump coordinate in the input list and prints the count of occurrences for each unique jump coordinate. The function does not have any return value.**
