Example Answer:
The value of `e` is assigned the floating-point value entered by the user using the `input()` function. The variables `m` and `test_list` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `e` is a floating-point number entered by the user.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `e` is a floating-point number entered by the user**
