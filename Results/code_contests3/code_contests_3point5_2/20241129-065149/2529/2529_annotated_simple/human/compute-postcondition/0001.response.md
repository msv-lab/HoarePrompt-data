Example Answer: 
No variables are affected by the creation of an empty list `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the number of ships with jump coordinates specified as (a+b)/c, `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is the number of ships with jump coordinates specified as (a+b)/c, `test_list` is an empty list**
