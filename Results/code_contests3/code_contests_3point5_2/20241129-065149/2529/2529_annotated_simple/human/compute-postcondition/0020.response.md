Example Answer:
The code prints the elements in `my_list` separated by a space. Since `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`, we are printing the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`. The values of `m`, `test_list`, `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers entered by the user, `e` is the last floating-point number entered by the user, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of each element in `test_list`**
