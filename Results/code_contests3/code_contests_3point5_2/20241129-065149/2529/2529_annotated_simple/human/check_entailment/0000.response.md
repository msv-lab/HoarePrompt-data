Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The input is expected to be arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, but the program tries to read floating-point numbers directly. This will lead to a ValueError as the program is not handling the arithmetic expression format specified in the problem description. Additionally, the logic to count the occurrences of each coordinate is missing from the program.

Therefore, the program does not do what the problem description asks for in any case.
