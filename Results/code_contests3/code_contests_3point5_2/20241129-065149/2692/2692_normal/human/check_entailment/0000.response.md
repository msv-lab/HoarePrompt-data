Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. While it correctly reads an even integer n within the range of 2 to 50 from the input and a string of digits, it fails to check if the ticket number is lucky. The code only checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits when split at n/2, which is not the same as checking if the ticket number is a lucky number. The code does not confirm that the ticket number only contains lucky digits (4 and 7) and does not handle this aspect of the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect in its implementation.
