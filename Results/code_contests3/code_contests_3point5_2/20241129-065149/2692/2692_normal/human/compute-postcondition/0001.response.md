Example Answer:
The code `n = int(raw_input().strip())` assigns the input value to `n` after converting it to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer with the range 2 to 50, the value of `n` will be within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer within the range 2 to 50.
Output State: **n is an even integer within the range 2 to 50**
