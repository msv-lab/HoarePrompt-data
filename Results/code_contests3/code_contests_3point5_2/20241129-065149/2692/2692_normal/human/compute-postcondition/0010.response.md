Functionality: **The function reads an even integer n within the range of 2 to 50 from the input and a string of digits. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits when split at n/2. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
