Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the ticket number is not a lucky number (i.e., does not only contain the digits 4 and 7). In this case, the program should output "NO", but the program does not check for this condition. This makes the program incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
