Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The main issue is with the way the input is processed. The `raw_input()` function is used in the program, which is not valid in Python 3. Instead, the `input()` function should be used to take input from the user. Additionally, the program does not actually check if the ticket number is a lucky number (containing only 4 and 7). It only checks if the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half. This means that the program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description.
