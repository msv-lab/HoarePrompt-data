Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. Within the function, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `digits` from the input. It then checks if the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half of `digits` when `n` is divided by 2. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function is intended to determine if a given ticket number is a lucky ticket number based on the sums of its digit halves. The preconditions state that `n` should be an even integer between 2 and 50, and the ticket number should be of length `n`.**
