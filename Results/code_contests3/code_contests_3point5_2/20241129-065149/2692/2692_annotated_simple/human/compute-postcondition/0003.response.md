Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, digits is a map object containing integers obtained from the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half of digits when n is divided by 2, with the condition sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]) being true***
