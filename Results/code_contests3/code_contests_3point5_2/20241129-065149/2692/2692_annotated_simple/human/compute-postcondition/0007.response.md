Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, digits is a map object containing integers obtained from the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. If the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half of digits when n is divided by 2, then the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function executes the else part where the sum of the first half of digits is not equal to the sum of the second half of digits.***
