Functionality: The function `func` reads an even integer `n` from the user input and then reads a list of `n` integers. It checks if the sum of the first half of the list is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. However, there is a missing edge case where the code does not handle the situation if `n` is odd.
