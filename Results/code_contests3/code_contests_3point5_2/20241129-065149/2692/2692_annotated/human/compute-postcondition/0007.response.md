Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `digits` is a list of n integers. If the sum of the first half of `digits` is equal to the sum of the second half of `digits`, then the program will return. Otherwise, the program will execute the else part and the sum of the first half of `digits` will not be equal to the sum of the second half of `digits`.***
