Example Answer:
The code `digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())` converts the input string into a list of integers. Since the initial state specifies that n is an even integer between 2 and 50, the length of the input string will be equal to n. Therefore, after execution, `digits` will contain a list of n integers.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `digits` is a list of n integers**
