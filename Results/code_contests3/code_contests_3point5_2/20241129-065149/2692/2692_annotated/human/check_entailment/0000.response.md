Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd, as mentioned in the annotations. The problem description clearly states that `n` will always be even, but the program does not check for this condition. This means that the program may give incorrect outputs for odd values of `n`. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
