Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`, `a` is now a non-empty sequence. The third element of `a` is `s`, therefore `i` is assigned the value `s`. Since `i` is not in ['H', 'Q', '9'], we do not break out of any loop or if statement. `YES` is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, each character in `p` has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, `a` is a non-empty sequence, `i` is 's'. `YES` is printed**
