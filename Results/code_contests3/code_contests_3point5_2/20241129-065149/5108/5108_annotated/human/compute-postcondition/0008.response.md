Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'YES' to the console. The values of `p`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, each character in `p` has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is a non-empty sequence, `i` is the second element of `a`.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, each character in `p` has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is a non-empty sequence, `i` is the second element of `a`**
