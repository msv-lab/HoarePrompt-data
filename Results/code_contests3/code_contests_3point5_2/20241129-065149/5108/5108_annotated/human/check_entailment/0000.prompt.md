You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: HQ9+ is a joke programming language which has only four one-character instructions:

  * "H" prints "Hello, World!",
  * "Q" prints the source code of the program itself,
  * "9" prints the lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song, 
  * "+" increments the value stored in the internal accumulator.



Instructions "H" and "Q" are case-sensitive and must be uppercase. The characters of the program which are not instructions are ignored.

You are given a program written in HQ9+. You have to figure out whether executing this program will produce any output.

Input

The input will consist of a single line p which will give a program in HQ9+. String p will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of p will be between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.

Output

Output "YES", if executing the program will produce any output, and "NO" otherwise.

Examples

Input

Hi!


Output

YES


Input

Codeforces


Output

NO

Note

In the first case the program contains only one instruction â€” "H", which prints "Hello, World!".

In the second case none of the program characters are language instructions.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Each character in p has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    for i in a:
        if i in ['H', 'Q', '9']:
            print('YES')
            a = 'tstr123'
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, each character in `p` has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive. `a` is either 'tstr123' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is in `a`, or it remains the same as the initial value.
    if (a != 'tstr123') :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, each character in `p` has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive. `a` is either 'tstr123' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is in `a`, or it remains the same as the initial value. Additionally, if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', the final state of `a` remains the same as the initial value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` prompts the user for input, checks if any of the characters in the input string are 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and updates the value of `a` to 'tstr123' then exits the loop. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and the output is not specified.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
