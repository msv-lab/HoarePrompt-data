The function `func` prompts the user for input, checks if any of the characters in the input string are 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and updates the value of `a` to 'tstr123' then exits the loop. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and the output is not specified.
