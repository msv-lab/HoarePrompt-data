Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints out the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the initial state of the variables `p` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is not an empty iterable.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is not an empty iterable**
