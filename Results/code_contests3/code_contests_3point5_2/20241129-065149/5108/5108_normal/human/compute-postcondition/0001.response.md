According to the code, the loop can execute if the user input `a` is not an empty iterable. Before the loop starts, `p` being a string with the specified constraints does not ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `a` should not be an empty iterable. 
State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is not an empty iterable for the loop to execute**
