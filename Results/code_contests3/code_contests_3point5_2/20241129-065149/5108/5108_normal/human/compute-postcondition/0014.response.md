Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the string 'tstr123'. The previous values of `p` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
