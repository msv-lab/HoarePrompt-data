Functionality: **The function `func` reads user input as a string `a` and checks if any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9' are present in the input. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of the characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on user input. The preconditions indicate that the input `p` should be a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126.**
