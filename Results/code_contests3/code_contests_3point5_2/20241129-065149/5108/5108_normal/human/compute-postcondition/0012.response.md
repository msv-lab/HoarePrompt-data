According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the iterable `a`. If `i` is 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop breaks. 

At the end of the last iteration, `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, and the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive. `a` is not empty.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Ensure that there are more elements left in the iterable `a`.
- If `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', the loop can continue.

State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is not empty, `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'**. This state ensures that the loop will execute one more time.
