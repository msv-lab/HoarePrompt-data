Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, the ASCII-code of each character in `p` is between 33 and 126, inclusive, `a` is not empty, `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
