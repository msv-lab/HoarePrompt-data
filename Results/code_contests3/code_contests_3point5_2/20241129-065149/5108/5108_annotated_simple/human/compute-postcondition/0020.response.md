Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII-code between 33 and 126, inclusive. `a` is either 'tstr123' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is found in `p`, or the input string `p` otherwise. If `a` is not 'tstr123', then the overall state remains the same.***
