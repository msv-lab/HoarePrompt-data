Example Answer: 
The code simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is assigned the input string `p`, `i` is the second character in the string `p` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is assigned the input string `p`, `i` is the second character in the string `p` for the loop to execute again**
