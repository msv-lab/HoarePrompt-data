The function `func` reads a string `p` from the user, iterates through each character in the string, and checks if any character is 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and assigns 'tstr123' to `a`. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
