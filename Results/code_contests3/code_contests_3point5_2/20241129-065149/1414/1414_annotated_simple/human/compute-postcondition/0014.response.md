Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` hold integer values based on the input. `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`. After the execution of the if else block, if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0 in the else part, then `a` is decremented by `v`.***
