Postcondition: ***`res` is incremented by 1. If `b >= k`, `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`, and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`. If `b < k`, `res` is incremented by 1. If `b > 0`, `res` is further incremented by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b <= 0`, `res` is incremented by 1, and `a` is decreased by `v`.***
