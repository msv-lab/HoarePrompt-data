Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the result of `(b + 1) * v` from the current value of `a`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are unknown, so the new value of `a` cannot be calculated directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is incremented by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`.
Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`**
