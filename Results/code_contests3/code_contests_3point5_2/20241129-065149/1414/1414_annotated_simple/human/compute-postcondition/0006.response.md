Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. Since `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b - (k - 1)` will result in a new value for `b`. The value of `a` is updated to `a - k * v`. The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` hold integer values based on the input, `res` is incremented by 1. `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` hold integer values based on the input, `res` is incremented by 1. `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`**
