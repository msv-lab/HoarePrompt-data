Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v` from it. The previous value of `a` is unknown, so the new value of `a` after the subtraction is uncertain. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is incremented by 1, the value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`.
Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, the value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`**
