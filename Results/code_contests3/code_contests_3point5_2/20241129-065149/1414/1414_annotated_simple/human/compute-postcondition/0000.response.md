Example Answer:
`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are unknown initially, but after the input, they will hold specific integer values based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` hold integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` hold integer values based on the input**
