Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are variables that are updated based on conditions. If `b` >= `k`, `k`, `b`, `v`, `res` remain the same. `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and the loop will execute again if `a` is greater than 0. If `b` < `k`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are updated based on conditions. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` where `a` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `v` and `res` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute again `a` needs to be greater than 0.***
