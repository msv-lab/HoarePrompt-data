Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `res`, `a`, and `v` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is incremented by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0**
