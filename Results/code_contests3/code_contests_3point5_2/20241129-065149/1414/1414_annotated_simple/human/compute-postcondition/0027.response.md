Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting the value of `k - 1`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are unknown, so the new value of `b` after the subtraction cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is incremented by 1, the value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`, and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`.
Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, the value of `a` is updated by subtracting the product of `k` and `v`, and `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`**
