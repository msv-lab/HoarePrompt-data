The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not have any input parameters. The function calculates a result based on the values of k, a, b, and v, which are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. The function returns a specific output based on the calculations performed using these integer values.
