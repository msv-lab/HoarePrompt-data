The function `func` reads input values for k, a, b, and v, where k, a, b, and v are integers satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. It then iterates a loop based on the values of a and b, calculating a result `res` that represents the number of iterations the loop executes. The function prints the final value of `res` after the loop finishes.
