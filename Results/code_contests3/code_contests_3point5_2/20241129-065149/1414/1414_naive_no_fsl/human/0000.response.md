Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where there are not enough divisors to divide the box into k sections. In this case, it should still put the nuts in the box without dividing it further. 

For example, for the input:
3 10 1 3

The program will output 3, but the correct output should be 4. The program fails to consider the scenario where there is only one divisor available and the box needs to be divided into 3 sections to accommodate all the nuts.
