Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, then enters a loop that decrements `a` based on the conditions involving `k`, `b`, and `v`. The loop increments a counter `res` until `a` becomes less than or equal to 0. The output of the program is the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in the boxes, which aligns with the problem description. The program handles the cases where `b >= k`, `b > 0`, and `b <= 0` correctly, ensuring that the number of boxes is minimized.
