The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. The function does not return any values explicitly, but it likely performs some calculations or operations based on the values of these variables.
