Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to the result of `a - (b + 1) * v`, and `b` is reset to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, then `a` is decremented by `v`, and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0.***
