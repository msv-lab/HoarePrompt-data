Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 1. If `b >= k`, `b` is updated to the new value after subtracting `(k - 1)` from the previous value of `b`. `a` is updated to the new value after subtracting `k * v` from the previous value of `a`. If `b < k`, `a` is updated to 1 if `b` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
