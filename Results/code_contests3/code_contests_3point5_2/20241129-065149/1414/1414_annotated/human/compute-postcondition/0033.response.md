Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is the number of times the loop executed. If `b >= k`, `b` is updated accordingly. If `b > 0`, `a` is updated based on the provided formulas and `b` is set to 0. If `b <= 0`, `a` is decremented by `v`. In the end, `a` is less than or equal to 0.**
