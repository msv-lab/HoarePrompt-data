Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b` is not greater than or equal to `k`, then if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is reset to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, then `a` is decremented by `v`, and for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0.***
