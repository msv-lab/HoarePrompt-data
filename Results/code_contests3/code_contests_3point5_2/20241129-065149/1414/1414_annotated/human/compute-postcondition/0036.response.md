Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` which are integers within specific ranges. It then enters a loop that decrements `a` based on conditions involving `k`, `b`, and `v`. The loop increments a counter `res` until `a` becomes less than or equal to 0. The function does not explicitly return any value but prints the final value of `res`. **
