Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes required to put all the nuts in, based on the given constraints of maximum sections, number of nuts, number of divisors, and capacity of each section. It iterates through each nut, determining how many divisors to use for each box and updating the remaining nuts and divisors accordingly. The program handles all cases where the number of nuts, divisors, and capacity of each section are within the specified constraints.
