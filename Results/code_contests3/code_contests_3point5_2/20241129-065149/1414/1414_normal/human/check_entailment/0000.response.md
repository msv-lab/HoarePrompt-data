Correctness: **False**

The code does not entirely follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the calculation of the number of nuts to be placed in each box. The code uses the variable `v` to represent the capacity of each section of the box, but it does not accurately distribute the nuts based on this capacity. The code reduces the number of nuts to be placed in a box by `k * v` when the box can accommodate `k` sections, but it should actually reduce it by `k * (v - 1)` to ensure that each section does not exceed the capacity `v`. This discrepancy leads to incorrect distribution of nuts in some cases, violating the problem description. 

For example, consider the input `3 10 3 3`. According to the problem description, the first box should have three sections with three nuts each, but the code does not handle the distribution correctly due to the mentioned issue. This highlights a case where the code does not work as expected.
