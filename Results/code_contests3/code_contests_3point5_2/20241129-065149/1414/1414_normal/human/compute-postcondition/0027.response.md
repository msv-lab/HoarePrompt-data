Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `b - (k - 1)`. The values of `b`, `k`, and `res` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 3, `a` is an updated integer value after subtraction, and `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`.
Output State: **`res` is 3, `a` is an updated integer value after subtraction, `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`**
