Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - v`, where `v` represents a specific value that is not provided. The value of `res` is not affected, and `a` is updated based on the value of `v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 3, `a` is an updated value after subtracting `v`.
Output State: **`res` is 3, `a` is an updated value after subtracting `v`**
