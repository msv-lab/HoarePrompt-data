Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting the result of `(b + 1) * v` from the previous value of `a`. The variables `res` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 3, `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `(b + 1) * v`.
Output State: **`res` is 3, `a` is updated to a new value based on the calculation `(b + 1) * v`**
