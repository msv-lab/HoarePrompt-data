Postcondition: ***`res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0, `v` is not defined. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated based on the calculation and `b` is 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` remains an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.***
