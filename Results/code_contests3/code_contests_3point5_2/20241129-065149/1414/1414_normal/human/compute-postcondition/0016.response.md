Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. The value of `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is 2, `a` is an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`res` is 2, `a` is an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again**
