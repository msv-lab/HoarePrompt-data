Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `b - (k - 1)`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are unknown, so the result of this calculation cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 2, `a` is an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `a` is updated to the result of the subtraction a - k * v, and `b` is updated according to the formula b = b - (k - 1).
Output State: **`res` is 2, `a` is an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `a` is updated to the result of the subtraction a - k * v, `b` is updated according to the formula b = b - (k - 1)**
