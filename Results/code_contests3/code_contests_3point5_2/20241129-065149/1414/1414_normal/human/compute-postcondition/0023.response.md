Postcondition: ***`res` is 2, `a` is an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. If `b >= k`, `a` is updated to a - k * v, `b` is updated to b - (k - 1). If `b < k`, `a` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated based on the calculation and `b` is 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` remains an integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.***
