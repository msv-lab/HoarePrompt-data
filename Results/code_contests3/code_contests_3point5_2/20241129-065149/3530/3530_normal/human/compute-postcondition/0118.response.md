Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo MOD.***
