Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `MOD`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. Also, the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. After applying the modulo operation, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[i+1][mask+1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] with the modulo operation applied.
