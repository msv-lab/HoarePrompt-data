Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp[n+2][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask, where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n+2, `mask` is less than 1 << n+2, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit at position `j` set, then `dp[n+2][mask]` is updated accordingly.***
