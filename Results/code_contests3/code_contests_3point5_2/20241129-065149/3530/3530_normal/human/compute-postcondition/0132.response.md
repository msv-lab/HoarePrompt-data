Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with MOD.**
