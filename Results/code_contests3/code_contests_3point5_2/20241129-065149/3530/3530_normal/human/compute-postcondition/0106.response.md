According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `mask`, and the conditions mentioned in the problem description. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the necessary computations are stored in `dp[i+1][mask+1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. Also, the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the modulo operation.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[i+1][mask+1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 2, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. Additionally, the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the modulo operation applied if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1.**
