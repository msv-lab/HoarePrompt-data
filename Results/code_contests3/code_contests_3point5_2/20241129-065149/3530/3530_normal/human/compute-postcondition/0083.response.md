Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask+1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute `j` is 0. `a` is a matrix of integers, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `mask` is an integer, `n` is an integer. The condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is true.***
