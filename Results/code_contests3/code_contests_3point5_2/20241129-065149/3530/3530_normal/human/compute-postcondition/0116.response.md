Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are predefined as described in the initial state. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, the calculation proceeds. After execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask.**
