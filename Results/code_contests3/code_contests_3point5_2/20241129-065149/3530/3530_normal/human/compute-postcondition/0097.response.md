According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask+1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. So, for the loop to execute another time, `mask` should be less than 1 << n, `i` should be 1, and `j` should be 0.
State: **At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask+1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 0**.
