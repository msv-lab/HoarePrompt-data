Output State: **`dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask, where n is greater than 0, i is n + n, mask is less than 1 << n + n + 1, `j` is n. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the remainder when divided by MOD after updating it with `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all valid combinations of i and mask**
