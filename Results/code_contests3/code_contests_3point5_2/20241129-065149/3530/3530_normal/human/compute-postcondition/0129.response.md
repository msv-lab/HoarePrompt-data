According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, and `j` is 0.
State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
