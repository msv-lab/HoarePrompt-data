Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask, where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n + n, `mask` is less than 1 << n + n + 1. The loop updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo MOD.**
