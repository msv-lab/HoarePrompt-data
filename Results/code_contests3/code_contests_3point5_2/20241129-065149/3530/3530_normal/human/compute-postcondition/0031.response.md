Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, `_` is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. For each iteration of the loop, if a[i - 1][j] is 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.**
