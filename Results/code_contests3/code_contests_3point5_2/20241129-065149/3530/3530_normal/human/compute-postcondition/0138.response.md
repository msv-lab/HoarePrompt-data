According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n+1][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+1 and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n+1, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, `j` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be updated to be n+2.
- `j` should be updated to be 2 for the loop to execute the second time.
- Based on the conditions mentioned (`a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`), the necessary computations in `dp[n+1][mask]` should be updated accordingly.

State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n+2][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask, where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n+2, `mask` is less than 1 << n+2, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.**
