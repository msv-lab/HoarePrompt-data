Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, `_` is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute n times, `i` starts from 1, `mask` starts from 1, for the loop to execute, `j` starts from 0. The loop iterates through all elements of a[i - 1] and updates dp[i][mask] based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, dp[i][mask] will hold the necessary computations modulo MOD.**
