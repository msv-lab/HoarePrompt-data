Output State: **N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), for the loop to execute `i` ranges from 0 to (1 << n), dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be in the range of 0 to (1 << n), dp[0][i] is 1.**
