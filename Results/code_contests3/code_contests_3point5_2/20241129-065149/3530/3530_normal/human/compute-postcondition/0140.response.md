Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[n+2][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask after updating.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n+2][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask after updating**
