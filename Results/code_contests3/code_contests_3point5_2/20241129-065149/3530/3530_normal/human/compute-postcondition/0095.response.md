Output State: **At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask+1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. All other variables maintain their initial values, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 2. The loop iterates through each `j` in the range of `n`. If the condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the remainder modulo MOD.**
