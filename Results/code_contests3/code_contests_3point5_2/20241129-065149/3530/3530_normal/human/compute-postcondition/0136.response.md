Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo MOD of its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `dp[n+1][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+1 and mask, the output state remains the same with the necessary computations modulo MOD retained for all combinations of n+1 and mask.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n+1][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+1 and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n+1, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time.**
