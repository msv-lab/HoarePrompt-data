Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, dp[n][mask] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to n, `mask` is less than 1 << n, for the loop to execute `j` is within the range of `n`. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
