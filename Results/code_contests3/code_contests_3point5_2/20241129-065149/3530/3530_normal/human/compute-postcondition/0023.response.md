Output State: **N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` starts from 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, a[i - 1][j] is 1, mask & 1 << j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and then dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.**
