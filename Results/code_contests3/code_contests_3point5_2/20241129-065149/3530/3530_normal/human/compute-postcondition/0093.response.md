Output State: **At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask+1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `j` is 1, `a` is a matrix of integers, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `mask` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` if `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is now updated to be the remainder of the division by MOD.**
