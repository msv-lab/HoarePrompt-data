Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of i, mask, and j are known, and the condition is satisfied. Therefore, after execution, the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i and mask are updated accordingly.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, dp[1][1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of 1 and 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 1. In addition, `a` is a list, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `mask` is a bitmask, and the condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is satisfied.**
