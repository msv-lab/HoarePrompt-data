Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n. The loop iterates through all values of `j` from 0 to n-1, updating `dp[i][mask]` based on the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`.**
