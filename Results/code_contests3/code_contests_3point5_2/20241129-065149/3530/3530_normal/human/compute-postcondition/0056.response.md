Output State: **N is a positive integer, a has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, a is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, i is incremented by 1, mask is incremented by 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute a second time j is 1 and n is greater than 1, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].**
