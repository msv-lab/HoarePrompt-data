Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder when divided by MOD. This operation does not change the values of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask after updating dp[i][mask] with dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and `dp[i][mask]` has been modified to its remainder when divided by MOD.
Output State: **`dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask after updating dp[i][mask] with dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and `dp[i][mask]` has been modified to its remainder when divided by MOD**
