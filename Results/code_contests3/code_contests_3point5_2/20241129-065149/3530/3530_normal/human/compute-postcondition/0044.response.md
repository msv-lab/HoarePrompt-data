According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n + 1`. In the for loop, `j` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 2`.
State: **N is a positive integer, a has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, a is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1. i starts from 1, mask starts from 2, j is less than n + 2**
