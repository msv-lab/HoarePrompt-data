Example Answer:
The code prints the value stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `mask` is less than `1 << n`. As a result, the output state is: At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask. All other variables maintain their initial values, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n, and the value stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed.
