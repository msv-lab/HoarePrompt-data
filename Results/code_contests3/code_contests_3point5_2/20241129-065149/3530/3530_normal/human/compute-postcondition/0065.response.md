According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of `i` and `mask`. All other variables maintain their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop, dp[i+1][mask] will hold the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask. All other variables will maintain their initial values.**
