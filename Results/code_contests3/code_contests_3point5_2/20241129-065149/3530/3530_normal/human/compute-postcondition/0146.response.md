Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variable `i` is `n + n`, `mask` is a combination of bits, `j` is 1, and the condition `(a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)` holds. The computation is done modulo MOD. After execution, the states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask, where n is greater than 0, i is n + n, mask is less than 1 << n + n + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n` and `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j).
Output State: **`dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask, where n is greater than 0, i is n + n, mask is less than 1 << n + n + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n` and `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)**
