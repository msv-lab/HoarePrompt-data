According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new `_` should be 1.
State: **Output State: N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is 1**
