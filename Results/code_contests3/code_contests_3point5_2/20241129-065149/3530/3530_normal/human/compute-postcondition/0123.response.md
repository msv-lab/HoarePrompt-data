According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n. Since the loop is iterating over `j`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be within the range of `n` but less than `n-1`.
