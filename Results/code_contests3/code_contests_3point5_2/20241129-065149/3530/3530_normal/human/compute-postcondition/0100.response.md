Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo MOD of its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[i+1][mask+1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. n is greater than 0, i is 1, mask is less than 1 << n, j is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1.
