Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, a has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, a is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, i is incremented by 1, mask is incremented by 1, j is set to 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 0 and n is greater than 0. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], and dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD.***
