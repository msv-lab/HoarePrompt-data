Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `dp[n+1][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+1 and mask, where `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n+1, `mask` is less than 1 << n+1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the necessary computations are updated in `dp[n+1][mask]` based on the conditions mentioned.***
