Output State: N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, _ is n-1. The loop appends a total of N lists to `a` with integers obtained by mapping the input values after splitting.
