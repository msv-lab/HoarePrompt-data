Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo MOD of its current value. The values of `n`, `i`, and `mask` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is n, `mask` is less than 1 << n**.
