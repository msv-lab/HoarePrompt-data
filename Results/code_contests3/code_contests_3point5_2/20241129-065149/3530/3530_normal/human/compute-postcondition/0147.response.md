Output State: **`dp[n + n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n + n and mask, where n is greater than 0, i is n + n, mask is less than 1 << n + n + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is less than `1 << n` and `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j)**.
