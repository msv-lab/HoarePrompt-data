According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. Additionally, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[i+1][mask+1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1. Additionally, the (j+1)-th bit of mask is set to 1.**
