Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo MOD. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and MOD are unknown, so the output state is: At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo MOD.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n and mask, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo MOD.**
