Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` are defined in the initial state, so we can calculate the result based on those values. After execution, `dp[n+2][mask]` will hold the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask with the updated values.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `dp[n+2][mask]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of n+2 and mask after updating**.
