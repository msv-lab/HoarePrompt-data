Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, `_` is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute n+1 times `i` starts from 1, `mask` starts from 2, `j` starts from 0. The value at index (i-1, j) in list a is 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set to 1.***
