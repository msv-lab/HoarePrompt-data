Example Answer: 
The map function converts the input values to integers and appends them at the end of list `a`. Since the dimensions of `a` are N x N, this operation adds a new row to `a`. The value of `n` is used to determine the number of integers to be added to the new row. The value of `_` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N+1 lists each containing integers from the input, _ is 2.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the input value, `a` is a list of N+1 lists each containing integers from the input, _ is 2**
