Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. After execution, the necessary computations modulo MOD have been updated for all combinations of i and mask. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `dp[i+1][mask+1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of i+1 and mask+1. `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is less than 1 << n, `j` is 0, and a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1. Additionally, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1.
