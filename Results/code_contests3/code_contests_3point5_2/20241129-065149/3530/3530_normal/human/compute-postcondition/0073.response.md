Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial state indicates that at the end of the loop, dp[1][1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of 1 and 1, and the condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is satisfied. Therefore, after execution, the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of 1 and `mask` are updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, dp[1][1] holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of 1 and 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and the condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is satisfied.**
