According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[1][1]` holds the necessary computations modulo MOD for all combinations of 1 and 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mask` is 1. The condition (a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j) is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
