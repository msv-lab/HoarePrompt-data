Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, `_` is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with 0 values of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n), all elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute n times, `i` starts from 1, `mask` starts from 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` starts from 1 at the beginning of the loop. If a[i - 1][j] is 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD. After the execution of the if condition, the overall state of the program variables remain the same as the precondition with the additional update that `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
