Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a` has dimensions N x N with each value being either 0 or 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the input value, `a` is a list of N lists each containing integers from the input, `_` is n-1, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) with all elements initialized to 0, `i` starts from 1, `mask` starts from 2, `j` is less than n + 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` in it. All elements in dp[0] are assigned the value 1.**
