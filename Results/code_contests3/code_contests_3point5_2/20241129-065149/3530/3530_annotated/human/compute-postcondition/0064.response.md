Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, n is still greater than 0, a still contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ remains n-1, dp is still a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i remains 1. All values of dp[i][mask] have been updated according to the formula provided in the loop code for all valid values of j and mask.**
