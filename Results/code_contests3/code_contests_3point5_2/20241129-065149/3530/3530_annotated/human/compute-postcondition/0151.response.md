Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. This ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range specified by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
