Postcondition: ***`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the next value of `j` is within the specified range. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the calculated value modulo MOD.***
