According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that i starts at 1 instead of 0. Therefore, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i is 1**
