Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `mask ^ 1 << j` flips the j-th bit of `mask` to 0 or 1 depending on its current value. All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, so the values of `i` and `mask` are within the specified range. The element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix `a` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, the element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix `a` is 1, the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n.
Output State: **All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, the element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix `a` is 1, the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n.**
