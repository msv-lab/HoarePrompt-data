According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the specified range. If `j` is within the specified range, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at a certain value within the specified range. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next value of `j` must be within the specified range.
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the next value of `j` is within the specified range**
