Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` after taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 and is still within the specified range. 
Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range. `dp[i][mask]` is updated as described above.**
