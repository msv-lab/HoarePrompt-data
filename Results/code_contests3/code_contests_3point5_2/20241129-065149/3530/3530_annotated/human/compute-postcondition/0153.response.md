According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration will be:
State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j+1` are within the specified range. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
