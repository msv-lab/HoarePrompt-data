Postcondition: ***MOD remains 1000000007, n is still greater than 0, a still contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ remains n-1, dp is still a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i remains 1, mask is now `mask + 1`, j is now n, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the (j-1)th bit set to 1. After the execution, dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking modulo MOD.***
