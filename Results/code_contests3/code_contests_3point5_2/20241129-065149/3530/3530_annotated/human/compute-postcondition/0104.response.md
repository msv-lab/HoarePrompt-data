Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the current value of `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. This operation modifies the current value of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated values of `dp` based on the calculation.
Output State: **Updated values of `dp` based on the calculation**
