Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of this update operation. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set.
Output State: **final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set**
