Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The elements of `dp` are being updated based on the previous values of `dp` and the values of `mask` and `j`. The loop will only execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. 
Output State: **Updated values of `dp` based on the calculation**
