Postcondition: ***`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1. For the given condition, if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. The overall state of the program after the if else block will have the updated values based on the conditions mentioned.***
