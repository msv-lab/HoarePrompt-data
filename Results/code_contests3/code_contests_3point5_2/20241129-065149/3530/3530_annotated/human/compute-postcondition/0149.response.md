According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.
State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range**
