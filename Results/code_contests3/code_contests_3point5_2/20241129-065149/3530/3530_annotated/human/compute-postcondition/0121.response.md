Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD` if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be incremented by 1 and still be within the specified range**
