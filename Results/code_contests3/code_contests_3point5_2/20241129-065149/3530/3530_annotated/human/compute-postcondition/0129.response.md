According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the final value of `dp[i][mask]` needs to be updated only when `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, the loop will execute only if these conditions are met. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than 0 and the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met**
