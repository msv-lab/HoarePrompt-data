According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `mask` must be within the range of 1 to 1 << n. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is within the specified range. Since the loop is iterating over `mask`, the next value of `mask` will be the current value plus 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `mask` should still be within the range of 1 to 1 << n.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set.**
