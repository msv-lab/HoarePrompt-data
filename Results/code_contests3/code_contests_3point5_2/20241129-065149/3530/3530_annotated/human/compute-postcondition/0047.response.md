Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the program ensures that MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i is 1, all values of dp[i][mask] have been updated according to the formula provided in the loop code, j is n-1, if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] has been updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and dp[i][mask] has been updated with the modulo operation dp[i][mask] %= MOD. The program also ensures that dp[i][mask] has been updated with the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and dp[i][mask] has been updated with the modulo operation.***
