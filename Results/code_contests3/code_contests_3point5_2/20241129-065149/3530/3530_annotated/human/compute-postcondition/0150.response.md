Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
