Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified according to the specified operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the next value of `j` is within the specified range, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` followed by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the next value of `j` is within the specified range, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` followed by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`**
