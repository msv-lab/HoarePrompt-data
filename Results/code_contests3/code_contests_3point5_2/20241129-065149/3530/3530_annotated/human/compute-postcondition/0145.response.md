Postcondition: ***`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set***
