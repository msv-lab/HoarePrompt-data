Based on the provided code snippet and the conditions mentioned, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` still contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1, `i` is n, `mask` is updated based on conditions, `j` is in the range of 0 to n-1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than `1 << n`**.
