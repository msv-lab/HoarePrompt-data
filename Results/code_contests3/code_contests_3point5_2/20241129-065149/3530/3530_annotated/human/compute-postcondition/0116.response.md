Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are within the specified range. The element at index `i-1` of list `a` at index `j` is 1, and `mask` has a 1 at the `j`th position. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated**
