According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the specified range. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is within the specified range. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `mask` needs to be considered. Since the loop is incrementing `mask` by 1, the next value of `mask` should be within the specified range.
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` is the result of updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `mask` should be within the specified range**
