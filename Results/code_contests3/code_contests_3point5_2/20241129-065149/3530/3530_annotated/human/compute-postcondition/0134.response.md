According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is within the specified range. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the specified range.
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the next value of `j` is within the specified range**
