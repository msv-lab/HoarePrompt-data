Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i is 1, j is 0, mask is 1. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set to 1, then dp[i][mask] is updated to dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.***
