According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop iterates over `j` and `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be increased by 1.
