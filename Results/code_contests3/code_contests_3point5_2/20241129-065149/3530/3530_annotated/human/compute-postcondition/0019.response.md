According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range condition is satisfied, which means mask should be in the range from 1 to (1 << n) exclusive. 

Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute. To ensure this:
- MOD remains 1000000007
- n is greater than 0
- a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input
- _ is n-1
- dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1
- i is 1
- mask is 1 for the first iteration

State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i is 1, for the loop to execute the first time mask is 1**
