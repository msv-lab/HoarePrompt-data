According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1, `i` is n, `mask` is updated based on conditions, `j` is 1, `j` is less than `n`, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the jth bit of `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
