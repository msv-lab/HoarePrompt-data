Example Answer:
Since `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the remainder when divided by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`**
