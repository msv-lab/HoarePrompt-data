At the end of the last iteration, the key conditions to consider for the loop to execute again are:
- `n` is still greater than 0
- `i` is n
- `j` is 1
- `j` is less than `n`
- a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1
- the jth bit of `mask` is set
- `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
- `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD` if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1, `i` is n, `mask` is updated based on conditions, `j` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the jth bit of `mask` is set, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD` if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j**.
