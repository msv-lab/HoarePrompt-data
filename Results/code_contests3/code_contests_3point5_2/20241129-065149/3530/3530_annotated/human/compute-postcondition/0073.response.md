Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` still contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is updated based on conditions, `j` is in the range of 0 to n-1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
