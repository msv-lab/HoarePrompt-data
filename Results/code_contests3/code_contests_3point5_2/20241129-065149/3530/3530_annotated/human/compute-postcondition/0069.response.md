Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` still contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, `_` is now n, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with the first element of dp[0] initialized to 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is in the range of 0 to n-1. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
