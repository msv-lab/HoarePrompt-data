Output State: **The final value of `dp[i][mask]` is printed, where `i` is `n` and `mask` is `(1 << n) - 1` after updating it by taking its modulo with `MOD` for every execution of the loop where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set for all possible combinations of `mask` and `j`.**
