Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `^` represents the XOR operation and `<<` represents left shift. The values of `i`, `mask`, `j` are known within the specified range, and the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met. Therefore, the Output State is: *`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than 0 and the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1.
