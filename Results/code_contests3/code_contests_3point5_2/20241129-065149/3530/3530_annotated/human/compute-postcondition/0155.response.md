Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j+1` are within the specified range and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j+1` are within the specified range and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the calculation**
