Example Answer:
If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` are both true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask`, and `j+1` remain the same. 
Output State: **`MOD`, `n` is greater than 1, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j+1` are within the specified range. `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
