According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are less than `(1 << n) - 1. The element at index `i - 1` and index `j` of matrix `a` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`.
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are all less than `(1 << n) - 1`. The element at index `i - 1` and index `j` of matrix `a` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`**
