Postcondition: ***`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1 and still within the specified range. When `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its value modulo `MOD`.***
