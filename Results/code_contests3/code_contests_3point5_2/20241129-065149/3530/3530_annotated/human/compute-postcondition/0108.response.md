Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. The values of i, mask, and MOD are not provided, so the output state is: All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, the element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix `a` is 1, the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n.
Output State: **All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, the element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix `a` is 1, the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n.**
