Example Answer: 
dp[i][mask] is incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of the variables are within the specified range, so after execution, dp[i][mask] is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i][mask] is updated with the calculated value.
Output State: **dp[i][mask] is updated with the calculated value**
