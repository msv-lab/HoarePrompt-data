According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the updated values are:
State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask` less than `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` less than `n`**.
