Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the specified range. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` are met, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1**
