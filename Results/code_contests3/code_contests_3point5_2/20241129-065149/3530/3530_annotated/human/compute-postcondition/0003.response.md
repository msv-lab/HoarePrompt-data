According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `n` is greater than 0. At the beginning of the loop, `a` is an empty list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `_` is now 0.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 0**
