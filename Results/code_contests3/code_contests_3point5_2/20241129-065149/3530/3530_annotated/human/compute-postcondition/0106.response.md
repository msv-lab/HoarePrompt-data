According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are less than (1 << n) - 1, the element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix a is 1, the j-th bit of mask is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following state adjustments need to be made:

State: **All variables are less than (1 << n) - 1. The element at index i - 1 and index j of matrix a is 1. The j-th bit of mask is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than n**.
