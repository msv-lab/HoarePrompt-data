Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask` are all less than `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is less than `n`. The element at index `i - 1` and index `j` of matrix `a` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
