Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a contains a list of n lists of integers from the input, _ is n-1, dp is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (2^n) with all elements of dp[0] initialized to 1, i is 1, j is 1, mask is 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided in the program fragment.***
