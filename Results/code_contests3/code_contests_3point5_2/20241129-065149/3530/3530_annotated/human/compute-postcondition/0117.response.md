Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. Since the previous values of the variables are unknown, the output state is: `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, `j` are within the specified range, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`**
