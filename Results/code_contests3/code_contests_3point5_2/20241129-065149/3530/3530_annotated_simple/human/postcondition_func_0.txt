The function `func` initializes a variable `MOD` with the value 1000000007, reads an integer `n` from input, and then populates a list `a` with `n` lists of integers obtained from the split input. It then creates a 2D list `dp` with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) and fills it with ones. Subsequently, it iterates through nested loops to update the values in `dp` based on conditions involving the elements in list `a`. Finally, it prints a specific value from `dp` based on the calculations performed earlier. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have explicit return values.
