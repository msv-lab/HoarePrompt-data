Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), mask is equal to (1 << n), n is greater than 0, j is 1, the conditions for updating dp[i][mask] need to be met for the loop to execute another time, updated value of dp[i][mask].
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), mask is equal to (1 << n), n is greater than 0, j is 1, the conditions for updating dp[i][mask] need to be met for the loop to execute another time, updated value of dp[i][mask]**
