Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the final values in `dp[i][mask]` will be calculated based on the conditions specified in the loop code.**
