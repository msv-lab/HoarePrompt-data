Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), mask is equal to (1 << n), n is greater than 0, j is 1, the conditions for updating dp[i][mask] need to be met for the loop to execute another time, and the updated value of dp[i][mask].
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), mask is equal to (1 << n), n is greater than 0, j is 1, the conditions for updating dp[i][mask] need to be met for the loop to execute another time, updated value of dp[i][mask]**
