According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the mask is within the range of 1 to 1 << n. So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after all iterations of the loop have executed.
