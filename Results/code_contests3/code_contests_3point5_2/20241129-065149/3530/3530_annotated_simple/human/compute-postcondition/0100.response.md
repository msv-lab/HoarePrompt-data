Example Answer:
The code snippet takes the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with the value of MOD. Therefore, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `dp[i][mask]`, `MOD`, `n`, or `mask`, the output state will only mention that the modulo operation has been performed on `dp[i][mask]`.
Output State: **The modulo operation has been performed on `dp[i][mask]`**
