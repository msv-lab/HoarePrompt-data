Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n, `mask` is less than (1 << n), `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than n+1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit at position `j` set, then certain operations are executed on the program variables.***
