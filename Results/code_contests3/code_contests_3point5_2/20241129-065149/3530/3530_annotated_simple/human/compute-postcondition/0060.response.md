Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `j` are required for calculation. After the execution, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is obtained by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to its previous value.
Output State: **Updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the if else block executes**
