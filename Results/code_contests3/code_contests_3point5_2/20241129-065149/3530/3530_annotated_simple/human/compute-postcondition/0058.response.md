Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n+1) x (1 << n)`, `mask` is equal to `(1 << n)`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the conditions for updating `dp[i][mask]` need to be met for the loop to execute another time, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the if else block executes.***
