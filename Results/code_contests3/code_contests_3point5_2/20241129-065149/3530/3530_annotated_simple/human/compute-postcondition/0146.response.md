Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` and `j` are used to access the corresponding elements in the lists `dp` and `a`. Since the element at index (i-1, j) of list `a` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is non-zero, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `mask` is within the range of 1 to (1 << n), and `dp[i][mask]` is updated as described above.**
