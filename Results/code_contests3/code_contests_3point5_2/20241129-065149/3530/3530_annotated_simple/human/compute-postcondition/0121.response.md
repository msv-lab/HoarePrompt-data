Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than n, Updated values in dp[i][mask] are computed by taking the modulo of the current value with MOD.**
