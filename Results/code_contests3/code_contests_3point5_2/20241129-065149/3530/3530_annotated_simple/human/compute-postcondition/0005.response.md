According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integers obtained from the input split, for the loop to execute another time `_` should be incremented by 1**
