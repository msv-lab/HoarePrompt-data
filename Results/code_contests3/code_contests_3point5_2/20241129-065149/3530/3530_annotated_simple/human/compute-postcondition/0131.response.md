Example Answer:
The value at dp[i][mask] is increased by the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `mask`, `a`, and `dp` are known. After executing the code, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `j` is 0, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the first time, and the element at index (i-1, j) in list `a` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated accordingly.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `j` is 0, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the first time, the element at index (i-1, j) in list `a` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated**
