Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(n+1) x (1 << n)`, `mask` is equal to `(1 << n)`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the modulo operation by MOD is achieved.***
