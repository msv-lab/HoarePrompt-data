Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n+1, `mask` is (1 << n), for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`.***
