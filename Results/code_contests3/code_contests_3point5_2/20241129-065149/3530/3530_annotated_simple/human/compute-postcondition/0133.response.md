Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `j` is 0, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the first time. If the element at index (i-1, j) in list `a` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, then dp[i][mask] is updated with the value of dp[i][mask] modulo MOD.***
