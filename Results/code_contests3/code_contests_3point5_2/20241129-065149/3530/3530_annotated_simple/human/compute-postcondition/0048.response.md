Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1. For i within the range of 1 to n, and mask less than (1 << n), dp[i][mask] will be updated with the modulo operation if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j for all j in the range of 1 to n. The final values of dp[i][mask] will reflect the accumulated updates based on the conditions in the loop.**
