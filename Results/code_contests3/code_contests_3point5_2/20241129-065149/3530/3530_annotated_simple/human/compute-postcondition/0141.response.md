Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n-1, `j` is 2, and `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the second time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.***
