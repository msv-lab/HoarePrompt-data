According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, MOD is 1000000007. To execute one more time, the value of `_` will be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n+1`.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `_` is n+1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `_`**
