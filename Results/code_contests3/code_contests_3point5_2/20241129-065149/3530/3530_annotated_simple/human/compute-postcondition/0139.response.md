Example Answer:
The value at dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value at dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of i, j, and mask are specified in the initial state. The output state after execution is:
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n-1, `j` is 2, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the second time, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the provided formula.**
