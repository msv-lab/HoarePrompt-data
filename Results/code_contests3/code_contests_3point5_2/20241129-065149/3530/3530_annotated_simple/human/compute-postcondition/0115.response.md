Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, for the loop to execute `j` is less than n, `dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after all iterations. The value at a[i - 1][j] is 1 and the jth bit of the mask is set***
