Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of i, mask, j, and n do not change during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n+1, `mask` is (1 << n), for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n+1, `mask` is (1 << n), for the loop to execute again `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
