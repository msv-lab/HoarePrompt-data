Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the `jth` bit of the mask is set. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are unknown, so the final state of `dp[i][mask]` cannot be calculated precisely.
Output State: **Undetermined final values in dp[i][mask]**
