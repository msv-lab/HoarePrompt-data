Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer less than n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to (1 << n), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is the length of list `a` and `j` is less than n. The element at index (i-1, j) of list `a` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is non-zero.***
