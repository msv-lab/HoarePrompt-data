Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value with MOD. Since the previous values of `dp`, `i`, and `mask` are not specified, the output state will only mention that `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with MOD**
