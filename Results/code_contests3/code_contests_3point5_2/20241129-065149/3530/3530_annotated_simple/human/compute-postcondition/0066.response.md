According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the range of 1 to (1 << n) exclusive. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, and i is within the range of 1 to n+1. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that `mask` is within the range of 1 to (1 << n).
