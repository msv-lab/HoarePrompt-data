Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than n + 1, and the updated value of `dp[i][mask] has been taken modulo MOD if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set.***
