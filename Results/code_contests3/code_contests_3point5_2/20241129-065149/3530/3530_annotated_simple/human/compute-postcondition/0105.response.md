Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n, `mask` is less than (1 << n), `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the program updates the elements in `dp` based on the conditions specified in the loop.***
