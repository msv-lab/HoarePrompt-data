Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The value of `n` remains consistent with its initial definition. The expression `(1 << n) - 1` calculates a bitmask where all `n` bits are set to 1. The final output will be the value stored in `dp[n]` at index `(1 << n) - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: the final value stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed.
Output State: **the final value stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed**
