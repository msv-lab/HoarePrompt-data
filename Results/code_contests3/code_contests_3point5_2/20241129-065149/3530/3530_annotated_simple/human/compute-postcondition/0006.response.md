Example Answer:
The `map` function is applied to the input split and the result is appended to list `a`. Since `_` is not incremented, the loop will not execute another time. The value of `MOD` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integers obtained from the input split.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integers obtained from the input split**
