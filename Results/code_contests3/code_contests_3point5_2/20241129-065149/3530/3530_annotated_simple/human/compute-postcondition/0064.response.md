Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, i is within the range of 1 to n. The final values of dp[i][mask] will reflect the accumulated updates based on the conditions in the loop after all iterations have been completed.**
