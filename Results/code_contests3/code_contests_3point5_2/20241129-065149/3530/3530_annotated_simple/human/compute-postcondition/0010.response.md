Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), where each element is initialized to 0. Here, n is the length of list `a` which contains n lists of integers obtained from the input split. The value of `MOD` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n).
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n)**
