Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and adding it to the current value. After that, the result is taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, i is within the range of 1 to n, mask is less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, and dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, i is within the range of 1 to n, mask is less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, and dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking modulo `MOD`**.
