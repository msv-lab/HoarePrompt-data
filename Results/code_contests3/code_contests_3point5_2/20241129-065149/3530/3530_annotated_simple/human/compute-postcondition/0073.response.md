Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The variables i, mask, and j are within their respective ranges. After this operation, the elements in the dp list are modified based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) with updated elements, i is within the range of 1 to n+1, mask is within the range of 1 to (1 << n) exclusive, j is 1**
