Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of i is within the range of 1 to n, and mask is less than (1 << n). The value of MOD is 1000000007. The previous values of dp, i, and mask are used to calculate the new value of dp[i][mask]. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, i is within the range of 1 to n, mask is less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute again. dp[i][mask] has been updated based on the formula provided.**
