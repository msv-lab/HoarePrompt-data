Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be its current value modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `MOD`, `a`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n, `mask` is less than (1 << n), `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
