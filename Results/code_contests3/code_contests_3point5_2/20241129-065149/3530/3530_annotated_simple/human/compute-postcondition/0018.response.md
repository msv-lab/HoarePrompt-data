According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to n inclusive. Before the loop starts, `i` is (1 << n) which is not within the range of 1 to n inclusive. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range of 1 to n.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, `i` is within the range of 1 to n**
