Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated, i is within the range of 1 to n+1, mask is within the range of 1 to (1 << n) exclusive, j is 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the program updates the elements based on the conditions in the loop.***
