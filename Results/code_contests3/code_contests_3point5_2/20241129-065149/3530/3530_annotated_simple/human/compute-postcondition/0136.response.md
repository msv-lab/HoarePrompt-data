Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo MOD. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but after taking the modulo operation, the value is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `j` is 1, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the second time, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after taking modulo operation.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `j` is 1, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n for the loop to execute the second time, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after taking modulo operation**
