Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are used in the calculation. After this operation, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` will depend on the previous values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, `i`, `mask`, and `j`.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than n, Updated values in dp[i][mask]**
