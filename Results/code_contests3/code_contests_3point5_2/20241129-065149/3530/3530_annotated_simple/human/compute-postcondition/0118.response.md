Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is n, `mask` is within the range of 1 to 1 << n, for the loop to execute `j` is less than n. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the final values based on the condition that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set.***
