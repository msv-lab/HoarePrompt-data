Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, mask is equal to (1 << n), n is greater than 0, j is 0. If the element in the (i-1)th list of a at index j is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is not 0, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after taking the modulo operation with MOD.***
