Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo by MOD. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` after the if else block executes is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: Updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the modulo operation by MOD.
Output State: **Updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the modulo operation by MOD**
