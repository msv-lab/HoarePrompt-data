Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the exact values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n, `mask` is less than (1 << n), `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
