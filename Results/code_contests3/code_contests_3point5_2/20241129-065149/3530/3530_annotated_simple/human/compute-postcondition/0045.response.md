Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, i is within the range of 1 to n, mask is less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute again, dp[i][mask] has been updated with the modulo operation if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, j is incremented by 1, dp[i][mask] has been incremented by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] after modulo operation**
