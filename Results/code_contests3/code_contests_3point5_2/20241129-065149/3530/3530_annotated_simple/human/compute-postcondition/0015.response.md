According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, the loop index `i` needs to be less than (1 << n). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to (1 << n) which means it has reached the maximum value. Therefore, the value of `n` needs to be decreased by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros of dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is (1 << n), for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1, `n` is decreased by 1**
