Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n+1, `mask` is less than (1 << n), `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The element at index (i-1, j) of list a is equal to 1 and the j-th bit is set in the mask.***
