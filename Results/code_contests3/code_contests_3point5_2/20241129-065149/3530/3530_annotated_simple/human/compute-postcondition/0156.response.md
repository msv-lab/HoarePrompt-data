Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n), `i` is an integer, `j` is increased by 2, `mask` is within the range of 1 to (1 << n). If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with MOD and adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.***
