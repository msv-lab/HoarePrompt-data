Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where all elements are 1, `i` is within the range of 1 to n, for the loop to execute the second time n is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the element at index i-1 of the list a has a value of 1, and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 shifted left by j is true. `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and each `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo MOD.**
