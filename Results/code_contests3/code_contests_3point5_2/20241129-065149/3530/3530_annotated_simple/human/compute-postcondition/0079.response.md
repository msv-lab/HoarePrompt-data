Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated. For the if part, if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated based on dp[i-1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.***
