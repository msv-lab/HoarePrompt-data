Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing n lists of integers obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where elements have been updated based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is n+1, `mask` is (1 << n), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
