Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The implementation only considers blocks of three consecutive consonants, and does not take into account blocks with more than three consonants. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where there are two different letters in a block of consecutive consonants. 

For example, if the input word is "hellno", the code will output "hell no" which is incorrect. The correct output should be "hellno" as there are not three or more consonants in a row with at least two different letters. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
