Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic described in the problem description. The program simply checks if the input string contains any vowel and returns True if it does not. This is not equivalent to the requirement of identifying typos based on consecutive consonants with at least two different letters.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
