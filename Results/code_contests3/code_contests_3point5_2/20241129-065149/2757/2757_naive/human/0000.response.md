Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where there are multiple typos in the word. For example, if we input "hellnohackcerrs", the program would output "hell no hack", but the correct output should be "hell no hack cerrs". Since the program doesn't handle multiple typos correctly, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
