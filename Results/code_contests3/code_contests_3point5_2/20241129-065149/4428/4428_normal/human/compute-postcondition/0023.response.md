Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` from the user input, followed by a string `S`. It then iterates over the characters in the string and increments the result if the character is 'I' and decrements the result otherwise. After the loop, if the result is negative, it is set to 0. Finally, the function prints the resulting value. The functionality does not include any return value or parameter acceptance as the code directly prints the result.**
