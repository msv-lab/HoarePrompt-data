Example Answer: 
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, S is a user input string, result is 1, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. In the state after entering the if condition, S[i] is equal to 'I'.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, S is a user input string, result is 1, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0. In the state after entering the if condition, S[i] is equal to 'I'**
