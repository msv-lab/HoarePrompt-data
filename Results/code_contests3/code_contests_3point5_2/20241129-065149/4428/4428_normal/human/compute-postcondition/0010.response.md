Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so after execution, `result` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 1, S is a user input string, for the loop to execute a second time i is 1 and S[i] is equal to 'I' or not equal to 'I' based on the result of the if statement, result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is greater than 1, S is a user input string, for the loop to execute a second time i is 1 and S[i] is equal to 'I' or not equal to 'I' based on the result of the if statement, result is incremented by 1**
