Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value 0. The variable `S` is assigned the input string from `raw_input()`, but as `raw_input()` is not defined in Python, it will raise a NameError. Therefore, the Output State is: NameError, `S` is assigned the input string from raw_input(), `result` is 0.
Output State: **NameError, `S` is assigned the input string from raw_input(), `result` is 0**
