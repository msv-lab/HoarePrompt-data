Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from user input. It then iterates over the characters in `S`, incrementing the result by 1 for each 'I' and decrementing it by 1 for other characters. If the final result is negative, it sets it to 0. Finally, it prints the resulting value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
