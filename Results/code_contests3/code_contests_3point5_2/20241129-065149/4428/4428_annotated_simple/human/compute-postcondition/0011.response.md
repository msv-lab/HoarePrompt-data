Example Answer:
`result` is decremented by 1, so if the initial value of `result` was 1, after execution it becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `NameError`, `S` is assigned the input string from raw_input(), `result` is 0, for the loop to execute the second time `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`NameError`, `S` is assigned the input string from raw_input(), `result` is 0, for the loop to execute the second time `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
