#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers such that -10^4 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^4.**
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two points using the distance formula. The function correctly computes the distance between the points without any missing or additional functionality.
