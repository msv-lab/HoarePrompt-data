Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input consisting of two lines, each containing three space-separated integers representing the city's coordinates and the distance from the city to the flatlanders.
- The program calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points using the provided function `func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.
- It then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The output is formatted to display the minimum detection radius with 6 decimal places.

After carefully examining the code and the problem description, as well as considering the output hints, the code seems to correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum detection radius as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints align with the code functionality, further supporting the correctness of the program.
