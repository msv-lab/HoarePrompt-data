Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the city and flatland ring.
2. The program calculates the distance between the two circles using the given function `func_1`.
3. The program then calculates the minimum detection radius based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
4. The program outputs the minimum detection radius with the required precision.
5. The formula used to calculate the minimum detection radius is correct and follows the problem description.
6. The program handles the cases where the circles are disjoint, tangent, or intersecting properly. 

Overall, the program seems to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
