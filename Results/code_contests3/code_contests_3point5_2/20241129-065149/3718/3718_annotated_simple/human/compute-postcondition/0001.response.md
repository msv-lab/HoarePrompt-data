The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, y2. These parameters are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 10^4. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 within the specified constraints and calculate and return the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 with absolute values less than or equal to 10^4 and returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).**
