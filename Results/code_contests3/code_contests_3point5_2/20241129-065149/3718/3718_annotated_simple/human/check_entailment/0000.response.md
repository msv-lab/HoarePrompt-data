Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem described in the problem description. The program simply calculates the Euclidean distance between two points, but the problem requires finding the minimum detection radius for a radar to detect the start of the movements of both flatland rings. The program does not consider the specific scenario described in the problem and does not provide the correct output. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
