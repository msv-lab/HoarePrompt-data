Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input of two cities and their distances from the flatland rings. It then calculates the distance between the two cities. Based on the distance and the radii of the flatland rings, it calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar and prints it with 6 decimal precision, which is in line with the problem description. The logic in the code correctly handles all potential cases and provides the expected output.
