According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last index processed in the loop, and the absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is less than 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` must still be less than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the next index after the last processed index, and the absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is less than 2**
