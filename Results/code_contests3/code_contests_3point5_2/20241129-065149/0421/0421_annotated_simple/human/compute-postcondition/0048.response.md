Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is a list with at least 2 elements, i is the next index after the last processed index, and the absolute difference between elements at index i and i + 1 in nums is less than 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
