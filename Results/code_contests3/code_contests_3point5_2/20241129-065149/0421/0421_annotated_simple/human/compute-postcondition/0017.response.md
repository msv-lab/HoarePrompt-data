Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty. The loop will not execute as the loop only iterates through `len(nums) - 1` elements, and the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is not satisfied for all consecutive elements. Therefore, the loop will break after the first iteration, setting `flag` to False.**
