According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute the second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so `i` will be 2. Additionally, the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be less than 2 to not set `flag` to False and break out of the loop.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is less than 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
