Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input integer `n` representing the size of an array and a list of positive integers `ai` representing the height of a stack of ravioli. It then iterates through the list checking if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If such a difference is found, it sets the flag to False and exits the loop. After the loop, it removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag is True (meaning all height differences are less than 2) and 'NO' if the flag is False.**
