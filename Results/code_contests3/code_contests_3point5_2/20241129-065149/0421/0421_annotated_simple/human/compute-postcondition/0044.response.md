Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is less than 2. If the absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
