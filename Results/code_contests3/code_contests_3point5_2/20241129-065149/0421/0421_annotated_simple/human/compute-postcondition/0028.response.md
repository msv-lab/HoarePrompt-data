Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
