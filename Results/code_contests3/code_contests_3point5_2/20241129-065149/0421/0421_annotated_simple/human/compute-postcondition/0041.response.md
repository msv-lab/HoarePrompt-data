According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nums` list. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` must be less than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is less than 2**
