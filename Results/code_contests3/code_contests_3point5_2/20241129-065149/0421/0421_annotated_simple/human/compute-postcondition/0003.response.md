According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a map object containing n integers. 
For the loop to execute the first time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty**
