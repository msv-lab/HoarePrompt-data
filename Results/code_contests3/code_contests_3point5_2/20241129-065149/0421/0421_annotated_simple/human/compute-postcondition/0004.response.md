According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer, `ai` being a list of n positive integers, and `flag` being True do not directly impact the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty**.
