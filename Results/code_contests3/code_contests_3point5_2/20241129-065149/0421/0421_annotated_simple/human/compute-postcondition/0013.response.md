According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `nums` - 2**
