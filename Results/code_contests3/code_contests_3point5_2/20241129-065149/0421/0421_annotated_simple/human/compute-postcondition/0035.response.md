According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is a list with the maximum element removed, for the loop to execute again `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty**
