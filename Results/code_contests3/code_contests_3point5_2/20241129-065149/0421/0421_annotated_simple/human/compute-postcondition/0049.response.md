Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the index of the last iteration. If the absolute difference between any pair of elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` remains False. Otherwise, `flag` remains False.**
