According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` should still not be empty and `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` is not empty, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, where i is less than the length of `nums` minus 2**.
