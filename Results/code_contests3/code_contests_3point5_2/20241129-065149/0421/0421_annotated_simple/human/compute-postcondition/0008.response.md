Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
