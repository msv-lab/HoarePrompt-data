Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `nums` - 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
