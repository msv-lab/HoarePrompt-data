Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty. If the absolute difference between any pair of consecutive numbers in `nums` is less than 2, then `flag` remains True after the loop finishes executing. Otherwise, `flag` becomes False.**
