Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and the loop will not execute again.***
