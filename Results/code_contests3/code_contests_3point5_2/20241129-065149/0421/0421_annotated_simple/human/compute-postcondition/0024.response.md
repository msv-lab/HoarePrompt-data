Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater or equal to 2, then `flag` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
