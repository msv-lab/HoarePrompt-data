According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False and `nums` has the maximum element removed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `flag` needs to be True.
2. `nums` should not be empty.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty**
