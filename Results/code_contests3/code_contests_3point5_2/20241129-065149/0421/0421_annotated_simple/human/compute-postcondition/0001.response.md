Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of a stack of ravioli, flag is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of a stack of ravioli, flag is True**
