According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` is not empty. The loop runs for the length of `nums` - 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` should not be empty and `i` should be incremented each time the loop runs. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` needs to be True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
