Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The variable `ai` representing the list of positive integers is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, and ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of a stack of ravioli.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the array, and ai is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the height of a stack of ravioli.**
