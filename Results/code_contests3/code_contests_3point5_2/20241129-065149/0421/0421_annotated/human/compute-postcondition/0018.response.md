Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum element from the list nums. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is True if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in nums is less than 2, False otherwise, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers after removing the maximum element.
