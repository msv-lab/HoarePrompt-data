According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, and the condition mentioned regarding the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1]. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains integers obtained by mapping elements of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must be greater than or equal to 2 needs to be considered. If this condition is met, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2**
