The code removes the maximum value from the list `nums`. Since `nums` is not empty, after removing the maximum value, the list will still have elements. The other variables `n`, `ai`, and `flag` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, `nums` is a list of integers with the maximum value removed**.
