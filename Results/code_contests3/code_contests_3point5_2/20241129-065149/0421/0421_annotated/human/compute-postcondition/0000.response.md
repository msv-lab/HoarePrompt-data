Example Answer: 
n is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The values of the elements in ai are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, and ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element in the list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, and ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element in the list**
