Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
