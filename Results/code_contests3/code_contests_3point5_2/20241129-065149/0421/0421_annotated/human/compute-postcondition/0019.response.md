According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, and `flag` represents the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers, flag is True, nums is not empty**
