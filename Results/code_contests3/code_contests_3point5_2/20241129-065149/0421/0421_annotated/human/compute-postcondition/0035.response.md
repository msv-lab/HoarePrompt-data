According to the code, the loop can execute again if `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, and `nums` has at least 1 element after removing the maximum element. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be adjusted to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty**
