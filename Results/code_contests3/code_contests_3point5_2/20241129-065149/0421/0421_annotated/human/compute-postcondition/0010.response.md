Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` is unknown, so after execution, `flag` is now `False`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 1 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 1 for the loop to execute the second time**
