Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `ai` from input. It iterates over the list `ai` and checks if there exists a pair of elements with an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to False. It then removes the maximum value from the list `ai`. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `flag` is True, meaning no pair with an absolute difference of 2 or more was found, and 'NO' otherwise.**
