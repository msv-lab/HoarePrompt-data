Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater or equal to 2, then `flag` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
