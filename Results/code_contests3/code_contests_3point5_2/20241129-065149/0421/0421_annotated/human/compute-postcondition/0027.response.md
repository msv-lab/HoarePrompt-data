Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is 1 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
