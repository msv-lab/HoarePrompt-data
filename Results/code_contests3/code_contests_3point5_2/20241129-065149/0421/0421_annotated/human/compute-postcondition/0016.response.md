Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, and the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
