Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is True or False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, flag is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
