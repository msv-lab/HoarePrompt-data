Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the flag is set to False and the loop breaks out.***
