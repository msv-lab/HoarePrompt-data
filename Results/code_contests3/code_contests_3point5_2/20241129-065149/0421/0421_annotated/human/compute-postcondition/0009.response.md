According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is True or False, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2, i is 1 for the loop to execute the second time**
