According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums[i]`, and `nums[i+1]`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
