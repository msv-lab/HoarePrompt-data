According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of nums is at least 2. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is True, and nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, n remains a positive integer, ai is still a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag remains True, and nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers with a length of at least 2. Additionally, i is 0 to execute the loop for the first time.
