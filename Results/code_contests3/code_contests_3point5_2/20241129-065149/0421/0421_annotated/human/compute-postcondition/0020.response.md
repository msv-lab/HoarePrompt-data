According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
