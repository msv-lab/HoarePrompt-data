According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty. 

Right before the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100, `flag` is `True`, and `nums` contains integers obtained from raw input split. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the conditions are already met - `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty. 

Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element, flag is True, nums contains integers obtained by mapping each element of raw input split into integers**
