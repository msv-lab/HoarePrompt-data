Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `n` and `ai` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element in the list, flag is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 for each element in the list, flag is True**
