Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem description. It checks if there exists a pair of elements in the input array with an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair is found, it sets the flag to False. It then removes the maximum value from the array and repeats the process until all elements have been removed. Finally, it prints "YES" if flag is True, indicating that the array can be sorted using the described procedure, and "NO" otherwise.

The program ensures that the ravioli stacks do not have a height difference of 2 or more at any point during the sorting process, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
