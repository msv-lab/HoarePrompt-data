Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the described algorithm. It iterates through the input array and checks if the absolute difference between adjacent elements is less than 2. If it finds a pair with a difference of 2 or more, it sets the flag to False, indicating that the array cannot be sorted correctly. The code then removes the tallest stack and continues the process until all stacks have been removed. Finally, it outputs "YES" if the flag is True, indicating that the array can be sorted correctly. 

The code covers all possible cases where the algorithm may fail, ensuring that the correct output is produced for any input array.
