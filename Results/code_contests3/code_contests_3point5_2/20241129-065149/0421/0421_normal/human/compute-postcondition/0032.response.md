Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop or if statement breaks out. Otherwise, the program continues as is.***
