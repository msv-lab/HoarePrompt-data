According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
