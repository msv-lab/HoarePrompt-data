According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` has at least one element and `flag` is True. 
Since the loop starts at `len(nums) - 2`, to execute the first time `i` should be equal to `len(nums) - 2`. 
Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty**
