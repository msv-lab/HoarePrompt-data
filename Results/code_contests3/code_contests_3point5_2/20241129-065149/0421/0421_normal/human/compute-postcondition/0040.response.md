Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2. For the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` should not be empty. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
