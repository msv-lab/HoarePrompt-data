Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
