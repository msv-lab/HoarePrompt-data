Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 1 element with the maximum element removed, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1. If the absolute difference between any elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break. Otherwise, `flag` will retain its previous value.**
