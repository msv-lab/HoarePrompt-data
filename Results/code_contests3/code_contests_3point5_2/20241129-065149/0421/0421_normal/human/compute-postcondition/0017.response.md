Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between any pair of adjacent elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` will be False, otherwise, it will remain False.**
