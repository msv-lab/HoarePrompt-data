Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then `flag` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
