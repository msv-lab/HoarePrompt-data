According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- If the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the second time**.
