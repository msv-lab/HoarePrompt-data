According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True and `nums` contains integers converted from input split by space. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `nums` should not be empty. Therefore, the initial state should be adjusted such that `nums` is not empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty**
