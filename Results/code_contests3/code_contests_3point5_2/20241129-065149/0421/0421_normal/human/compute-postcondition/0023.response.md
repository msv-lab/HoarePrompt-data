Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
