Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False or True based on the conditions mentioned, `nums` has at least 1 element with the maximum element removed, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1. If the absolute difference between any elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break. Otherwise, `flag` will retain its previous value. The output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.**
