According to the code, the loop will execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False which does not satisfy the loop condition. However, `nums` is not empty which satisfies the loop condition. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be adjusted to True.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2**.
