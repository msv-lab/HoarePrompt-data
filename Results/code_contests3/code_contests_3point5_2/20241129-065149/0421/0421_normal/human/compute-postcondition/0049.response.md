Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 1. The loop will iterate through all elements in `nums` comparing each element with the next one. If at any point the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` will be set to False and the loop will break. Otherwise, `flag` will retain its previous value.**
