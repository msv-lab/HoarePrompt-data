According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 1 element, and `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between any pair of adjacent elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False. Otherwise, `flag` remains True. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` has at least 1 element, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty**
