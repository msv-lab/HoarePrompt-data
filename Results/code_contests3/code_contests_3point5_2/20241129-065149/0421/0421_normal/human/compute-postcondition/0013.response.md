According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of nums - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, it is less than the length of nums - 1, which means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, to execute the loop again, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2**
