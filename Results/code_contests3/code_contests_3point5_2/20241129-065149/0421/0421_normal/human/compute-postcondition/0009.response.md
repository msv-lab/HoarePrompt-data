According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0. Since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums - 1`. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1**.
