Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between any pair of adjacent elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False. Otherwise, `flag` remains True.**
