Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 100 inclusive, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, then `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
