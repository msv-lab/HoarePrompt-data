The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `ai`, then iterates over the list to check if the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements is less than 2. If this condition holds for all pairs of adjacent elements, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, instead, it reads input from the user.
