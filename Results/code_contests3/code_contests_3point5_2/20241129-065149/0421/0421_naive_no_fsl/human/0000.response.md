Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where two stacks of ravioli are next to each other and differ in height by two or more. This violates the sorting algorithm described in the problem statement. 

For example, if the input is:
3
3 1 2

The program will output "YES" even though the algorithm will not sort the array correctly due to the ravioli from the stack of height 3 sliding on top of the stack of height 1.
