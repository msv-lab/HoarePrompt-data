The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have the same length that ranges between 2 and 100 characters inclusive. The function's output is not explicitly provided; however, based on the parameters, it is implied that the function will perform some operations or comparisons between the two strings. Since the output details are missing, we cannot specify the exact return values. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two strings, `S` and `T`, both made up of lowercase English letters and of equal length, where the length is between 2 and 100 characters inclusive.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters S and T, both strings of lowercase English letters and of equal length between 2 and 100 characters.**
