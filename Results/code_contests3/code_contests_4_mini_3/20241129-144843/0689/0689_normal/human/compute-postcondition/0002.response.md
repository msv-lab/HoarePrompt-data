To determine the output state based on the provided Python code snippet and initial state, we analyze the code step by step.

1. The code is using the `print` function to display a value based on a conditional expression.
2. The expression checks if the string `s` can be formed by any rotation of the string `t`.
3. The part `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` generates all possible rotations of the string `t` by slicing it at every index `i`.
4. The `any` function returns `True` if any of the rotations match `s`, and `False` otherwise.
5. The result of `any` is used to index into the list `['No', 'Yes']`. If `any` returns `True`, it indexes to `1`, resulting in 'Yes'; if `False`, it indexes to `0`, resulting in 'No'.

Since the specific values of `s` and `t` are not provided, we cannot determine if the output will be 'Yes' or 'No'. Therefore, we will state the output state in terms of the general relationship.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters; output is 'Yes' if `s` is a rotation of `t`, otherwise 'No'.**
