The function accepts two strings `s` and `t`, both consisting of lowercase English letters and of equal length between 2 and 100 characters. It checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` in any way (i.e., if `s` is a rotation of `t`) and prints 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it is not. The function does not accept parameters directly but instead reads the input from the user.
