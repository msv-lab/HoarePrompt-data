To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

### Problem Description:
We need to determine if string `S` is equal to string `T` after performing a rotation operation. The rotation involves moving the last character of the string to the front.

### Program Code:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Output Hints:
The function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` in any way and prints 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it is not.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code reads two strings, `s` and `t`, from input.
2. It checks all possible rotations of `t` by concatenating `t[i:]` (the substring from index `i` to the end) with `t[:i]` (the substring from the start to index `i-1`).
3. The `any()` function checks if any of these rotations match `s`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Identical Strings**: If `s` and `t` are identical (e.g., `s = "abc"`, `t = "abc"`), the program should return "Yes".
2. **Different Lengths**: The constraints guarantee both strings are of equal length, so this case is handled.
3. **All Characters the Same**: For example, `s = "aaaa"` and `t = "aaaa"`, the program should return "Yes".
4. **Rotated Strings**: Proper examples include `s = "kyoto"` and `t = "tokyo"`, which should return "Yes".

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`, which aligns with the code functionality. The code correctly utilizes a generator expression to check all rotations of `t` against `s`.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, the code correctly implements the logic to determine if `s` equals `t` after rotation. It handles all specified cases, including edge cases of identical strings and rotated strings.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
