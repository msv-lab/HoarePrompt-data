The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` in any way (i.e., if `s` is a substring of `t` concatenated with itself). It prints 'Yes' if such a rotation exists and 'No' otherwise. However, it does not return any value but directly prints the result.
