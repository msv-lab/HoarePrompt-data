Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read the strings `s` and `t`. However, `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3; it should be replaced with `input()`. If this code is run in Python 3, it would raise a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for Rotation Check**: The comment states that the function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. The logic used in the program checks if `t` can be rotated to match `s` using the expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))`. This is indeed a valid way to determine if `s` is a rotation of `t`, but the comments and the function name suggest that it is checking the other way around (i.e., if `s` can be rotated to become `t`).

3. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on whether `s` is a rotation of `t`, while the problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" or "No" based on whether `S` equals `T` after rotation, implying that `S` should be checked against rotations of `T`, not the other way around.

4. **Return Value**: The function does not return any value; it only prints the result directly. While this is not explicitly stated as a requirement in the problem, it is generally preferred to return a value, especially in a proper function.

### Conclusion:
Due to the above reasons, including incorrect handling of input, potential confusion in logic regarding which string is being checked against the others, and the lack of return value, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the correctness of the program is **False**.
