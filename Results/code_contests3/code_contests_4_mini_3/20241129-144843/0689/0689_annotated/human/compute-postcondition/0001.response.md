The variable `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. The previous values of `S`, `T`, and `s` remain unchanged as this line of code only affects `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters; `s` is an input string; `t` is an input string.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters; `s` is an input string; `t` is an input string.**
