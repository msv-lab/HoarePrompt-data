The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100 characters, and the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal. After executing the function body, the output is based on a comparison of the two strings. The specific return value depends on the implementation of the function, which is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two strings `S` and `T` of equal length and perform some operation or comparison on them, returning a result based on that operation or comparison.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters S and T, both of which are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters. The function performs an operation or comparison on these strings and returns a result based on that operation.**
