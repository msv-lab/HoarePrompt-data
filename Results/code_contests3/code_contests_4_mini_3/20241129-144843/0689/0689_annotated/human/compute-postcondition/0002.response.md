To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

1. The code snippet uses the `print` function to output either 'No' or 'Yes' based on a condition.
2. The condition checks if any rotation of string `t` (by slicing) matches the string `s`.
3. The expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` evaluates to `True` if there exists at least one index `i` such that the rotation of `t` at index `i` equals `s`.
4. Based on the result of the `any` function, it selects 'Yes' if `True` and 'No' if `False`.

Given that `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters, and that `s` and `t` are also input strings, the output will depend on the actual values of these strings. The specific values of these strings are necessary to determine the result.

Since we do not have specific values for `s` and `t`, we can only state that the output will indicate whether `s` is a rotation of `t`.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters; `s` and `t` are input strings; the output is either 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether `s` is a rotation of `t`.**
