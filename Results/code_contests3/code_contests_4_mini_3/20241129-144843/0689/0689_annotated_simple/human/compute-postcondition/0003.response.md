The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it is implied that it operates on two strings, `S` and `T`, which are provided as input. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have equal lengths, with the length of each string being between 2 and 100 characters. The function performs operations on these two strings.

The output of the function is not provided. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function.

Functionality: **The function operates on two strings S and T, which are of equal length and consist of lowercase English letters.**
