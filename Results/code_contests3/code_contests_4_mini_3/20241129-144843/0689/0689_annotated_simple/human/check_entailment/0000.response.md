The provided program is intended to determine whether one string (S) is a rotation of another string (T). Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it adheres to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two strings `s` and `t` using `raw_input()`. However, `raw_input()` is a Python 2 function, and in Python 3, it should use `input()`. This does not affect the correctness regarding the problem, but it is worth noting for compatibility.

2. **Logic for Checking Rotation**:
   - The expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` generates all possible rotations of `t` and checks if any of them matches `s`.
   - The rotation is performed by slicing `t`. Specifically, `t[i:] + t[:i]` constructs a new string by taking the substring from index `i` to the end and concatenating it with the substring from the start to index `i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program uses a list indexing trick to print 'Yes' if any of the rotations match `s`, and 'No' otherwise. This is done by evaluating whether any rotation condition is met.

4. **Correctness**: 
   - The program correctly checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. Thus, it fulfills the requirement of the problem description to determine if `S` equals `T` after rotation. The program will output 'Yes' if a match is found and 'No' otherwise, which aligns with the expected output format.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. It checks all possible rotations of string `T` against string `S` and handles the output as required.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be asserted as follows:

Correctness: **True**
