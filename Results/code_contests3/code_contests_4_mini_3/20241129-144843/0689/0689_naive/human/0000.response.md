Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether string S can be transformed into string T through the specified rotation operation. The logic iterates through all possible rotations of T and checks if any of these match S. Given the constraints (|S| = |T| and both strings consisting of lowercase English letters), the program handles all possible cases correctly. 

The use of the expression `t[i:] + t[:i]` effectively creates each possible rotation of T, and the `any()` function checks if any of these rotations equal S. If a match is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Since the program covers all potential cases as outlined in the problem description, the correctness is confirmed as true.
