According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer, which means `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is now at least `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2.**
