The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, checking each element in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1` to find the maximum value. After all iterations, `temp` will contain the maximum value among the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1` has only one element, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` (or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1), and `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`.**
