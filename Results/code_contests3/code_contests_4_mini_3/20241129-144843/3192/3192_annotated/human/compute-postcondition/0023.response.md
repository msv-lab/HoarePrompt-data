The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 2, we evaluate `arr1[2]`, which is guaranteed to be an integer greater than 2 (as per the initial state). Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the greater of its current value and `arr1[2]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, `arr` includes the previous maximum value, and `maxval` remains unchanged.**
