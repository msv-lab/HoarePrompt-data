According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `arr1[0]`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the value of `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for the loop to run, as `xrange(1, arr1[0])` generates numbers starting from 1 up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`. 

Given that `i` is initialized to 1 and `j` is currently set to `arr1[0]`, the loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

For the loop to execute, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and the initial value of `j` should be 1. At the end of the last iteration (if the loop were to run), `j` would increment with each iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` includes the previous maximum value, and `maxval` remains unchanged**.
