To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means it will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times.
2. In each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`.
3. After the loop finishes, `temp` will hold the maximum value found in the slice of `arr1` from index `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`.

Given the conditions:

- If `arr1` contains at least one element greater than `1`, which means `arr1[0]` is at least `2`, the loop will execute at least once, and `temp` will be updated to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
- If `arr1[0]` is `2`, the loop will only execute once and `temp` will be set to `arr1[1]`.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than `2`, `temp` will be the maximum value from the elements `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have completed, we can conclude:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least `arr1[0]` elements, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`.**
