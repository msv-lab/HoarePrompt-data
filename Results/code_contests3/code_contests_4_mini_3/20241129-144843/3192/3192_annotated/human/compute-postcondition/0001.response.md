The variable `arr` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the defined range. The initialization of `arr` does not affect the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of both variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list**
