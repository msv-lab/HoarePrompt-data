The variable `maxval` is initialized to 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
