The code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The previous values of the affected variables are `arr1[0]`, which is a positive integer greater than 1, and `arr2`, which is a list that can hold any values. After executing the code, the value of `arr1[0]` is added to `arr2`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1, and `temp` has been appended to `arr`; `arr2` has now one additional element, which is `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1, and `temp` has been appended to `arr`; `arr2` has one additional element, which is `arr1[0]`.**
