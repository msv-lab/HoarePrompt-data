`arr` is appended with the value of `temp`. The value of `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`. Since `arr` includes the previous maximum value, it now includes both the previous maximum value and the new maximum value `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` includes the previous maximum value and the new maximum value `temp`, and `maxval` remains unchanged.
