The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into elements, and maps those elements to integers, assigning the resulting list to `arr1`. The initial state indicates that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the new values of `arr1` will directly reflect the input provided. 

Since `arr1` is being reassigned, the previous state of `arr1` is replaced with the new input values, and `arr1[0]` now represents the length of the new list. Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `temp`, `j`, `arr`, and `maxval` are not directly affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is the list of integers from input, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr` includes `temp`, and `maxval` is updated to the maximum value of `arr[i]` and `maxval`.**
