According to the code, for the loop to execute, the value of `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, since the loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 2, these variables do not directly affect the for loop's execution.

The state of `j` is currently set to `arr1[0] - 1`, which is appropriate for the loop since it will be re-initialized at the start of the loop. However, to ensure the loop executes, we must confirm that `arr1[0]` is indeed greater than 1. 

Since `arr1` is a list of integers that includes at least one element greater than 1, we can safely assume that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

1. `j` must be 1 to start the loop at the first iteration.
2. `arr1[0]` must be confirmed to be greater than 1, which it is, given the initial conditions.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute the first time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.**
