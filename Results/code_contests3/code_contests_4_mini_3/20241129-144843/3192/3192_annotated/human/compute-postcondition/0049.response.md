According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `i`. 

Since `ans` has been updated during the last iteration, we do not need to adjust it further for this loop evaluation.

Assuming `i` is currently at its last value and considering the range of the loop, we increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1], for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i` (current value of `i` incremented by 1)**
