According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be greater than 0, which it is since it is given as a positive integer. The loop variable `i` will start at 0, and it will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Since `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists, they do not affect the loop's execution. However, it's important to note that during the first iteration, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is its starting value in the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
