The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 3, so we are comparing `temp` with `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers and has at least 1 element, `arr1[3]` is defined. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `temp`, which is either its current value or the value of `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is either its current value or `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3; `temp` is now assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[3]**.
