The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is defined as the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, and the other variables' values are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` has been added to `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least `arr1[0]` elements, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1, and `temp` has been appended to `arr`.**
