The code assigns `maxval` the maximum of the current `arr[i]` and the existing `maxval`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `arr` includes previous maximums, we can deduce that `arr[i]` refers to the second element in `arr`, and `maxval` is being compared to this value. Other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state will reflect the unchanged state of all variables except for `maxval`, which will now contain the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous `maxval`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` includes the previous maximum value and the new maximum value `temp`, `maxval` is now the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]` as a new element.**
