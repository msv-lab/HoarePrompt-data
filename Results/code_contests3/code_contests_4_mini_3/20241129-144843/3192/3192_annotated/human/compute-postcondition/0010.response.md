`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, we evaluate `arr1[2]`. The value of `temp` will either remain the same or be updated to the value of `arr1[2]`, depending on which is larger. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either its current value or `arr1[2]`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either its current value or `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
