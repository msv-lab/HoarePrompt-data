According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 (which it is, since `n` is a positive integer). After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 3 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is either its current value or `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
