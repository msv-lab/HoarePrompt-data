`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of `arr1`. The value of `arr1[1]` is unknown but greater than 1, so `max(0, arr1[1])` will result in a value that is at least `arr1[1]`. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to either 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`, which is greater than 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is now at least `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is now at least `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.**
