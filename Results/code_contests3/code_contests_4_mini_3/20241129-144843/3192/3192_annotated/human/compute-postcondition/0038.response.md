`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 3, we check the value of `arr1[3]`. The value of `temp` can be either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `arr1[3]` is an integer from the list. The previous values of `temp` and `arr1[j]` will determine the new value of `temp`. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of either its previous value or `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of either its previous value or `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3**.
