`arr` is a list that is being appended with the value of `temp`. The value of `temp` is previously determined to be the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` (or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1), `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and `arr` now includes `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` (or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1), `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and `arr` now includes `temp`.**
