According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `arr1` is a list of integers that includes at least one element greater than 1, we know that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1` must have a first element greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 2, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr` includes the previous maximum value, and `maxval` remains unchanged.**
