The code `temp = 0` assigns the value of `0` to the variable `temp`. This action impacts only the value of `temp`, and no other variables are affected in this operation. 

The previous value of `temp` was the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, but now it is reset to `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 2; `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is now 0; `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` includes the previous maximum value and the new maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is now the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous `maxval`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]` as a new element; `arr1` is now a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 2; `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1; `temp` is now 0; `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` includes the previous maximum value and the new maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is now the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous `maxval`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]` as a new element; `arr1` is now a list of integers from user input.**
