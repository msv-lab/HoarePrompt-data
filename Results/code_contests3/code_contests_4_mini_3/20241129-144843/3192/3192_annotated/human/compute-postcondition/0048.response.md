The expression `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to it. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `i` is 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we can assume that `arr` and `arr2` must have values at index 1 for the operation to execute correctly.

The output state reflects the updated value of `ans`, but since we lack specific values for `maxval`, `arr[1]`, and `arr2[1]`, we cannot determine a precise numerical result for `ans`. Therefore, the output state will express that `ans` is updated based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr[1]`, and `arr2[1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]**
