The variable `temp` is assigned the value 0. This overwrites the previous value of `temp`, which was the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is the list of integers from input, `temp` is 0, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr` includes the previous maximum value, and `maxval` remains unchanged.
