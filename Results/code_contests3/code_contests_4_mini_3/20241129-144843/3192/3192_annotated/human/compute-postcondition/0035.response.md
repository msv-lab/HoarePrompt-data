According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
