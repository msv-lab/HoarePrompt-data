The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to its current value. The previous values of `arr[i]` and `arr2[i]` are determined by the current value of `i`, which is 0 for the first loop execution. Therefore, the values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` will affect the calculation, but we do not have the specific values of these variables.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is initialized to 0, and it is assumed that `arr` and `arr2` have been defined with at least one element (since `i` starts at 0), we can express the update to `ans` in terms of its previous value.

The output state will reflect that `ans` has been updated by the calculated value based on the current indices of `arr` and `arr2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]**.
