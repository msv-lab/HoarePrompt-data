`arr1` is assigned the value of the list created by mapping `int` over the input received from `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string of numbers. Since `n` is a positive integer and the loop is set to execute, it indicates that there will be input, but the specific numbers are not given. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr1` is a list of integers derived from the user input, while `n` remains a positive integer and `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers derived from user input**
