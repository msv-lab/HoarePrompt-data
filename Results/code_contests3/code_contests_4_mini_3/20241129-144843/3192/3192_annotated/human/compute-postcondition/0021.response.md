`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers that includes at least one element greater than 1, `arr1[j]` will be greater than 0. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value found between 0 and `arr1[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1, `arr` includes the previous maximum value, and `maxval` remains unchanged.**
