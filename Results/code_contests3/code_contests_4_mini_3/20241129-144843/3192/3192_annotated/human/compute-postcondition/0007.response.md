According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`. The loop will iterate starting from 1 and will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not affect the loop execution directly, we need to ensure that `arr1` contains at least one element and that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
