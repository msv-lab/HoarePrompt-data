`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is initially 0, and `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list `arr1` at index `j` (which is 1). Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, it's reasonable to assume that `arr1[1]` is also an integer. The maximum function compares 0 and `arr1[1]` and assigns the higher of the two to `temp`. 

If `arr1[1]` is greater than 0, `temp` will take that value; otherwise, it will remain 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
