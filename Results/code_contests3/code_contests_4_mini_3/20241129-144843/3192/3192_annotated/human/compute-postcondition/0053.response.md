The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided definition. Instead, it operates on pre-defined constraints regarding the input data, which includes a positive integer `n` representing the number of companies, and a list of positive integers `m_i` indicating the number of employees in each company. The function will process this data to evaluate the salaries of the employees, which are also positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\).

Since the function does not take parameters but relies on the constraints and relationships implied, we can summarize what it does based on the output description provided.

Functionality: **The function processes employee salary data for a given number of companies and returns information based on the constraints of `n`, `m_i`, and employee salaries while ensuring the total number of employees does not exceed 200,000.**
