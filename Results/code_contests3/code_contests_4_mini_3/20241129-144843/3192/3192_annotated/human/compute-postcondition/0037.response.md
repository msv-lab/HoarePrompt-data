According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1, it must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 3**
