According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

Currently, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, and `j` is 2. 

For the loop to execute a third time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers including at least one element greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
