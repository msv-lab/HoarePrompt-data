According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means it can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr` now includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated to the maximum value of `arr[i]` and `maxval`.**
