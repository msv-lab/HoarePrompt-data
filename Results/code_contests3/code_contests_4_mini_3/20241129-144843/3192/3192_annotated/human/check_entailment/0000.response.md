The provided program is intended to solve the problem of merging companies while adhering to the anti-monopoly requirements. Let's analyze the program against the problem description step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of companies, followed by `n` lines of employee salary data. This matches the problem description.

2. **Extracting Maximum Salaries**:
   - For each company, the program correctly identifies the maximum salary using a loop. This is necessary to determine how much to increase salaries for merging, which is consistent with the requirement that merging is only allowed when maximum salaries are equal.

3. **Calculating Total Salary Increase**:
   - After determining the maximum salary across all companies (`maxval`), the program calculates the total increase needed to bring all salaries up to this maximum. It does this by iterating over the maximum salaries of each company and computing the difference multiplied by the number of employees in that company.
   - This calculation is correct as it ensures that all employees in each company receive the same increase, which adheres to the labor union's conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the total increase required, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements laid out in the problem description. It correctly calculates the minimum total increase needed to allow merging of all companies while ensuring that all conditions are satisfied.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
