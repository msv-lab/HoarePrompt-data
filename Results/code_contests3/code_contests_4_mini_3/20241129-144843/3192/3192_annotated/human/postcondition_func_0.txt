The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of companies, and processes salary data by reading `n` lists of employee salaries. It calculates the maximum salary for each company, then determines the total adjustment needed to equalize all salaries to the maximum salary across all companies, weighted by the number of employees in each company. Finally, it prints the total adjustment needed. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, nor does it validate the input sizes or salaries against the stated constraints.
