The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `max(temp, arr1[j])`. The current value of `temp` is `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])`, and `j` is 3. Thus, `arr1[j]` corresponds to `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1` contains at least three integers greater than 1, `arr1[3]` is a valid integer. The exact values of `arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`, and `arr1[3]` are not specified, but we know that `temp` will be updated based on the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` will now be the maximum between its previous value (derived from `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`) and the value of `arr1[3]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now max(temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 3**
