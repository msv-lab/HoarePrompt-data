`arr` is modified by appending the value of `temp` to it. The value of `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, and since `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` will be a valid positive integer. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1.**
