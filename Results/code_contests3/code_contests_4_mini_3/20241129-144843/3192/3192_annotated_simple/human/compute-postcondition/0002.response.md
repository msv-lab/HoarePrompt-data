`maxval` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables do not change, as `n` is a positive integer and `arr` is still an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
