The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The initial state specifies that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, which implies that `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Consequently, `arr2` will now contain this value.

The previous values are:
- `arr2` is an empty list.

After the execution, `arr2` will contain one element, which is the value of `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1.**
