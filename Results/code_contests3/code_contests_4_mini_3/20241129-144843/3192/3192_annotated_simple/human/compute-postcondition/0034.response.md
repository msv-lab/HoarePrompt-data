The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we need to check the value of `arr1[1]`. The previous value of `temp` is 0. The impact of this code will depend on the value of `arr1[1]`.

If `arr1[1]` is greater than 0 (which it is, as `arr1` contains integers greater than 1), then `temp` will be updated to `arr1[1]`. If `arr1[1]` is less than or equal to 0, `temp` would remain 0.

However, since we know `arr1` has at least 2 integers greater than 1, we can conclude `arr1[1]` is positive, and thus `temp` will be set to this positive value.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `temp` has been updated to `arr1[1]`, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`**.
