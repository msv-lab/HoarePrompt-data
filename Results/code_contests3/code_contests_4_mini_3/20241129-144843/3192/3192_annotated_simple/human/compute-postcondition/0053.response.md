The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. Instead, it processes input data related to companies and their employees' salaries. The function expects to handle multiple companies, each associated with a positive integer `m_i`, which denotes the number of employees in that company. Each of these employees has a corresponding positive integer salary.

Since the function does not return any specific output description in the provided information, we will focus on the input constraints and the expected behavior.

Functionality: **The function processes data related to multiple companies and their employees' salaries, with the number of companies and salaries constrained by given limits.**
