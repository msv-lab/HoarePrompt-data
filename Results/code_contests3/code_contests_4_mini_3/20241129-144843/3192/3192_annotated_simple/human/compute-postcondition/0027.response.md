`arr` is updated by appending the value of `temp` to it. The previous values of `arr` remain unchanged except for the addition of `temp`. Since `temp` is defined as the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, it is a specific positive integer. The values of `n`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`, `j`, and `arr1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to its previous values, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to its previous values, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1**
