The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given the initial state, `temp` has already been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`. The value of `arr1[j]` is `arr1[3]`, which is used to compare with `temp`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `arr` contains the value of `temp`, we don't have specific values for `temp` or `arr1[3]`. However, the comparison will still occur.

Thus, the output state reflects that `temp` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`**.
