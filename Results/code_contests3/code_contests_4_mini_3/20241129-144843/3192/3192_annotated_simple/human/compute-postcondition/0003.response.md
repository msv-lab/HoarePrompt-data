The code initializes `arr2` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is an empty list, and `maxval` is 0. Since `arr2` is being assigned a new empty list, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
