According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we increment `j` by 1, which makes `j` equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
