The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and since `arr` is being created as an empty list, there are no previous values to consider for it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5); `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5); `arr` is an empty list**
