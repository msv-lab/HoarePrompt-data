Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of companies, and for each company, it reads a list of salaries. It calculates the maximum salary across all companies and then computes the total difference between this maximum and the highest salary in each company, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it returns the accumulated sum of these differences, which reflects the total amount needed to equalize all salaries to the maximum salary found. **
