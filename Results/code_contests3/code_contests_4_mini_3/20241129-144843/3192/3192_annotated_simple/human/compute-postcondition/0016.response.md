The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. Given that `maxval` is initially 0, the final value of `maxval` will depend on the value of `arr[i]`. 

Since `arr` contains the value of `temp`, and `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr[i]` (which is `arr[0]`) will be compared to `maxval`. 

If `arr[0]` is greater than 0 (as it must be since it holds the value of `temp`), `maxval` will be updated to `arr[0]`. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects that `maxval` has been updated based on the comparison of `arr[i]` and its previous value:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1.**
