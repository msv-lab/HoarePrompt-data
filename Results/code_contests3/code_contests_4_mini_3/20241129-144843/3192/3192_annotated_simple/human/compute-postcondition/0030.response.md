According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer (which is at least 2 since `arr1` has at least 2 integers greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, it must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp` appended to its previous values, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]` and now also contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]; `j` is `arr1[0] - 1; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
