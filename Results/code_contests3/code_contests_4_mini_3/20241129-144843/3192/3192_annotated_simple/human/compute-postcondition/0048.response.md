The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The variables `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not defined in the initial state, but since `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, we can assume that `arr` and `arr2` have valid values at index 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by the value of `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]**
