The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, we have `arr1[j]` which corresponds to the third element of the list `arr1`. The value of `temp` is affected by comparing its current value with `arr1[2]`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, and `temp` is updated to `arr1[1]`, we can analyze the situation:

1. The current value of `temp` is determined by the previous state and will be compared to `arr1[2]`.
2. If `arr1[2]` is greater than `temp`, then `temp` will be updated to `arr1[2]`. If not, it will remain the same.

However, since we do not have the specific values of `temp` or `arr1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp` after this operation, but we can say that it will be the maximum of the previous `temp` value and `arr1[2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2.**
