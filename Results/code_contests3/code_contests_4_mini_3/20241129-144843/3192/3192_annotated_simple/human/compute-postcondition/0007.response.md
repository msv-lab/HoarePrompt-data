According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1` is not empty and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 because `xrange(1, arr1[0])` generates a range starting from 1 up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`. 

Since `arr1` is a list of integers from user input, we need to ensure that it has at least one integer and that this integer is greater than 1. Additionally, `j` will start at 1 when the loop executes for the first time.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `arr1` is not empty, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` is initially 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
