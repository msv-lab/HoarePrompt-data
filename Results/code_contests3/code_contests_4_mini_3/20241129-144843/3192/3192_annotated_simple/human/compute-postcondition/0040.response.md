The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. Since `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, the value of `temp` is now that maximum value. This operation does not affect the other variables directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp` (which is now appended), `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, and `temp` is appended to `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp` (which is now appended), `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`**
