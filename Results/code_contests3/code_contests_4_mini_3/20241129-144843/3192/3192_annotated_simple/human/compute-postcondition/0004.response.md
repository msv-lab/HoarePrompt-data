According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the initial value for the loop index in a `for` loop that iterates from 0 to `n-1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed for the first time, the state of `i` must be initialized to 0. The other variables, `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2`, do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but their initial states are as provided. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
