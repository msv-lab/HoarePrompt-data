To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the provided loop code and the initial state information.

Given the loop code:
```python
for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
    temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
```

This loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = arr1[0] - 1`. During each iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `arr` contains the value of `temp`.
- `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0.
- `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1.
- `temp` is now 0.
- `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1`.

### Loop Execution:
1. The loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times. 
2. `temp` will be updated during each iteration to be the maximum of its previous value and the current `arr1[j]`.
3. At the end of the loop, `temp` will contain the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.

### Final Output State:
If `arr1` has at least 2 integers greater than 1, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, and `temp` will be the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`. Assuming `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.**
