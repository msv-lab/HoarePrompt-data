To analyze the output state after the loop executes all iterations, we note that the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. During each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`.

After all iterations of the loop:

- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop will have incremented `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of the products calculated in each iteration, which is the total accumulated value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The values of `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` remain unchanged as they are not modified during the loop.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all i from 0 to n-1, `arr` contains maximum values from each of the arr1 lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in arr, `arr2` contains the sizes of each arr1 list.**
