According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1, and for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 1 since it needs to satisfy `i < n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
