`arr1` is assigned the value of a list created from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` takes input from the user and `map(int, ...)` converts each split string into an integer. The variable `arr1` will contain the integers provided as input, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input**
