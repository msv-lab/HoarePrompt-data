According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which is initialized to `n - 1` before the loop starts. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, ensuring that the range for `i` is valid. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it guarantees that `n` is at least 1.

Before the first iteration, `i` should be adjusted to the value 0, as `i` will start from the lowest value in the range generated by `range(n)`, which is 0 when `n` is 1. 

Thus, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `i` is now set to 0, and since `n` is already a positive integer, it is confirmed that the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
