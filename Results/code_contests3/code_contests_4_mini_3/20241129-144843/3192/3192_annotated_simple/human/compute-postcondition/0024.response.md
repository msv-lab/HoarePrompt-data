According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
