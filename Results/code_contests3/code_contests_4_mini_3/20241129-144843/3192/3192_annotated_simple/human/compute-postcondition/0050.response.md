The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The variables `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` need to be defined and their values checked to calculate the impact. However, since the values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the operation that occurs. 

The current values of `i` is 2, and for this operation to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect the increment of `ans` based on the operation described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2; `ans` is incremented by the value of (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2].**
