According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first item in `arr1` (which is `arr1[0]`). The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Additionally, `arr1` must have at least 3 integers (since `j` starts from 1 and must be less than `arr1[0]`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
