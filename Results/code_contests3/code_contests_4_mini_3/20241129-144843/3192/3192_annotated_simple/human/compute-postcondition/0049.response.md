According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
