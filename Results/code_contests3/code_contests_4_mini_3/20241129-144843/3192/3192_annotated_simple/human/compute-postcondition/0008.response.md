The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the value at index `j` of the list `arr1`. Since `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of the list `arr1`. Given that `arr1` contains integers and that it has at least one integer greater than 1, the value of `arr1[j]` will be greater than 0. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`.

Let's denote `arr1[1]` as a positive integer greater than 1, and the exact value is not known, but it's guaranteed to be greater than 0.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1, `temp` is now equal to `arr1[1]` (which is greater than 1), `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer greater than 1, `temp` is now equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**.
