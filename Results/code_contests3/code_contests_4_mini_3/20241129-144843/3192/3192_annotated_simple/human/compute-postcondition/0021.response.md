The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of the `arr1` list. Given that `arr1` contains at least 2 integers greater than 1, `arr1[1]` will be greater than 1, making the maximum value greater than 0. 

Thus, after execution, `temp` will be updated to `arr1[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**.
