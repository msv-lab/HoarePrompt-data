According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values within `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
