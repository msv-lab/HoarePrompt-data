The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, we need to consider the value of `arr1[2]`. The previous value of `temp` is `arr` (which contains the value of `temp`), and `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**.
