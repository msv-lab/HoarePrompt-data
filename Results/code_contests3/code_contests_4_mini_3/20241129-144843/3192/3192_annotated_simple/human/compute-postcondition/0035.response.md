According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1 (as `arr1` contains at least 2 integers greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
