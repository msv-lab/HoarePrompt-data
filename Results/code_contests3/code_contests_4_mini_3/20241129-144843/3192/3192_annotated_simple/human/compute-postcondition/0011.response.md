According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. We know that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers greater than 1, which means `arr1[0]` must be at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 3. For the loop to be executed again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers greater than 1, `temp` is now equal to max(`arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`), `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**.
