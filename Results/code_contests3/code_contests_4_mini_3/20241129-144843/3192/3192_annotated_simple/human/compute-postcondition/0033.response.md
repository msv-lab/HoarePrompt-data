According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `arr1[0]`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Since `j` starts at 1, it will iterate as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

Given that `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `j` is set to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means it will start from 1.

Therefore, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are:
- `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
- The initial value of `j` should be 1 for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
