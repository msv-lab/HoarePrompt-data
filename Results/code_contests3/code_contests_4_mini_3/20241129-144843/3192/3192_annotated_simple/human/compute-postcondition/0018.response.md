Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1; `arr1` is updated to a list of integers from input.**
