The value of `arr2` is updated by appending the value `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `arr1[0]` will be a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` plus the previously existing values, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` plus the previously existing values, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1**
