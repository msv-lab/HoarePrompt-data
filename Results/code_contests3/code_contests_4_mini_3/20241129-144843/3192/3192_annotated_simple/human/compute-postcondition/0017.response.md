According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute another time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is either `arr[i]` or remains 0, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers greater than 1, `temp` is equal to the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
