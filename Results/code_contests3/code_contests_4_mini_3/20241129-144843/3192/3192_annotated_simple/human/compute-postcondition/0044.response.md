The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `ans`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `arr1` lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each `arr1` list, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr1` is the last list of integers processed, `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1; `ans` is 0**
