To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program closely.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input Format**: First, we have an integer `n` indicating the number of companies. For each company, the first integer `m_i` indicates the number of employees followed by `m_i` integers representing the salaries of the employees.
2. **Merging Condition**: Companies can only be merged when their maximum salaries are equal. If they differ, the owners can increase the salaries, but they must do so uniformly across all employees within a company.
3. **Goal**: The objective is to find the minimal total increase of all salaries necessary to allow for the merging of all companies into one.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n`, the number of companies.
   - For each company, it reads the number of employees `m_i` and their respective salaries.

2. **Finding Maximum Salaries**:
   - The program correctly finds the maximum salary for each company and stores these values in the list `arr`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Overall Salary**:
   - The program also keeps track of the maximum salary among all companies with the variable `maxval`.

4. **Total Increase Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total increase needed to make all maximum salaries equal to `maxval`.
   - The increase for each company is calculated as `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `arr[i]` is the maximum salary of the `i-th` company and `arr2[i]` is the number of employees in that company.
   - The total increase (`ans`) is accumulated across all companies.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program outputs the total increase.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The logic in the program adheres to the requirements specified in the problem. It accurately computes the necessary total salary increase to ensure all companies can be merged, given the constraints:

- It properly identifies the maximum salary for each company.
- It calculates how much each company needs to increase its salaries to reach the overall maximum salary.
- It aggregates these increases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accurately determines the minimal total increase required for merging companies based on their salaries.

Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
