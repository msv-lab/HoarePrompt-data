According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. So, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`.**
