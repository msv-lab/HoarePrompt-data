`arr1` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which means it will contain a list of integers obtained from the input provided by `raw_input`. The previous values of the other variables (`n` and `i`) are unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input.**
