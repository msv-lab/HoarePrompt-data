In the given code snippet, `ans` is updated based on the values in `arr` and `arr2`. The specific calculation is `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `i` is currently 2. Consequently, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we can infer that `i` being 2 is valid, and thus `arr[i]` and `arr2[i]` can be accessed without causing an index error.

The calculation will result in updating `ans` according to the given formula, but since we don't have the exact values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]`, we can only describe the impact:

`ans` is assigned the new value of `ans + (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` values, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `ans` is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 2.**
