According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is either max(0, arr1[2]), which is either 0 or a positive integer, `j` is 3**
