After analyzing the loop and the provided output states for the first few iterations, we can derive the final output state after all iterations have completed.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. During each iteration, it reads a list of integers `arr1`, calculates the maximum among its elements (excluding the first), and appends this maximum to `arr`. Additionally, it appends the first element of `arr1` to `arr2` and updates `maxval` with the maximum value found in `arr` so far.

By the end of the loop:
- `arr` will contain `n` maximum values, each corresponding to the calculated maximum from the respective `arr1` lists.
- `arr2` will contain `n` values, each being the first element of the respective `arr1` lists.
- `maxval` will represent the maximum value found in the entire `arr`.

Given this understanding, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`.**
