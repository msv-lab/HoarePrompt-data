The `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The previous value of `i` is 2, so we will use `arr[2]` to compare with `maxval`. The value of `maxval` will be updated based on the comparison. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` has appended `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[2]` and the previous `maxval`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` has appended `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[2]` and the previous `maxval`.**
