The code assigns the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval` to `maxval`. The previous values are `arr[i]` (value from `arr1` list) and `maxval` (which is already defined as the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`). Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0, `arr[i]` refers to the first element of `arr1`, which is at least 2.

Thus, the value of `maxval` will be updated based on the comparison between `arr[0]` (which is at least 2) and the previously calculated `maxval`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`.**
