According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Additionally, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 3, `temp` is the maximum of its previous value (0) and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
