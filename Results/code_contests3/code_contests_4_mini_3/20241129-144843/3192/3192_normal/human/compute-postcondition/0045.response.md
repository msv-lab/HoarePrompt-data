According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the variable `i` must be initialized to 0 before the first iteration starts. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `ans` is initialized to 0, `i` is 0**
