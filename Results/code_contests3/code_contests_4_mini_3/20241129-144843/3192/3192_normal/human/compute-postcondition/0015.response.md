The code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `arr1[0]` is a positive integer (the first element in the list), and `arr2` is a list that can hold any values. The state of other variables (`n`, `i`, `temp`, `j`, `arr`) remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it, and `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it.**
