The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is known to be greater than or equal to 1 as per the initial state. Therefore, it will add a positive integer to `arr2`. The other variables, including `n`, `i`, `temp`, and `j`, are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `arr2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` has appended `arr1[0]`**.
