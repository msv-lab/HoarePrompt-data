The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged in value as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list**
