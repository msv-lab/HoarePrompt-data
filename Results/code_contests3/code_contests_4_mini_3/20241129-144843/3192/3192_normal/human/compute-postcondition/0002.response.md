The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `maxval`. The other variables, `n` and `arr`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
