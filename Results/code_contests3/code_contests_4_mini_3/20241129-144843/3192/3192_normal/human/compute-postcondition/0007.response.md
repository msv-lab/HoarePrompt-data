According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. 

Currently, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers, and `temp` is 0. If `arr1[0]` is 1, the loop will not execute because the range would be empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr1[0]` must be at least 2, and `j` should be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
