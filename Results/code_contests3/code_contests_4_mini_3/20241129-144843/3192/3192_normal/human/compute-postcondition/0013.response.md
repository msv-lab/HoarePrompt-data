The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, updating `temp` to be the maximum value between its previous value and the current element in `arr1` being referenced by the index `j`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `temp` will contain the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` starting from index 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

Since `arr1[0]` is at least 2, the loop will execute at least once. If `arr1` has more elements, `temp` will reflect the maximum value found within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.**
