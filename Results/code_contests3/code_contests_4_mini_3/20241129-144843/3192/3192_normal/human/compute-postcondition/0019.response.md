The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `temp` was the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`.
