The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect any other variables (`n`, `i`, or `arr1`). Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` has been initialized to `0`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from the input, `temp` is 0**
