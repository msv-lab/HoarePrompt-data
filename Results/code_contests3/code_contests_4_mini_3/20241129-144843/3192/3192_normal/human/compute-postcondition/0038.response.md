The code assigns `temp` the value of `max(temp, arr1[j])`. The previous value of `temp` is either `arr1[2]` (if `arr1[2]` > 0) or remains 0. The variable `j` is 3, thus `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[3]`. The value of `arr1[3]` is unknown, but since `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, we can assume the list has at least 4 elements.

The output state will depend on the values of `temp` and `arr1[3]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is max(temp, arr1[3])**
