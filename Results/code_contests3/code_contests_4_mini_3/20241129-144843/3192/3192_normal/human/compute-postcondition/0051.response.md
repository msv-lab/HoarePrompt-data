The loop iterates over each index of the `arr` and `arr2`, updating `ans` by summing the product of the difference between `maxval` and the current element of `arr` multiplied by the corresponding element in `arr2`. After the loop has executed for all `n` iterations, `ans` will contain the total accumulated value from this calculation.

If `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `ans` each time. Therefore, after all iterations, the final output state will reflect that `ans` is the result of the summation for all `n` elements.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `ans` is the accumulated result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
