According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the size of `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, which means the loop can execute again. The next value for `j` will be 3. 

For the loop to execute a third time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is either `arr1[2]` (if `arr1[2]` > 0) or remains 0, `j` is 3, and `temp` is max(temp, arr1[2])**
