In this code snippet, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, which means we're accessing the last element of `arr1` since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` holds the value of the last element in the list `arr1`.

1. We check the values:
   - `temp` is 0.
   - `arr1[j]` is `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, which is the last element of `arr1`.

2. The `max` function will compare `temp` (0) and `arr1[j]` (the last element of `arr1`). 
   - If the last element of `arr1` is greater than 0, `temp` will be updated to that value.
   - If it is less than or equal to 0, `temp` remains 0.

Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr1[j]` will also be a positive integer if `arr1` is composed of positive integers.

Therefore, the output state reflects:
- `temp` will be updated to either its current value or to `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`.**
