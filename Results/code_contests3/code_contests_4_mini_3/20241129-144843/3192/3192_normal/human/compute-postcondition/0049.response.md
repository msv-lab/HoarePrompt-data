According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

So, after this iteration, `i` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `ans`) remain unchanged since we are only focusing on the loop's control variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2.**
