According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n` times, where the current value of `i` is 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since the loop starts from 0 and goes until `n-1`, the next iteration will occur when `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased to 1.

Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer and is unchanged, the loop will still have the capability of executing if `n` remains greater than `i`.

So, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`, `i` is 1**
