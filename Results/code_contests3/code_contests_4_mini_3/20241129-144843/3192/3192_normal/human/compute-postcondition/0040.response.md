The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The previous value of `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, and the list `arr` is affected by this operation. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `arr1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, and `temp` is appended to `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, and `temp` is appended to `arr`.**
