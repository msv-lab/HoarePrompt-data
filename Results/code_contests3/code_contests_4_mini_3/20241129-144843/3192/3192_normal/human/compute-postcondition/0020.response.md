According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range function `xrange(1, arr1[0])` will generate values starting from 1 up to, but not including, `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, and `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, and `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be set to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means `j` will initially be `arr1[0] - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`**
