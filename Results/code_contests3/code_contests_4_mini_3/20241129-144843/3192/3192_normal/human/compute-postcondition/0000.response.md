The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The state of other variables is not affected by this assignment, as no other variables are mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` based on the integer input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
