The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of companies, and then processes the salaries of employees across these companies. For each company, it reads a list of salaries, identifies the maximum salary within that list, and stores it. After processing all companies, the function computes a value called `ans`, which is the accumulated result of the differences between the maximum salary across all companies and each company's maximum salary, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, the function prints this accumulated result.

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input format may not meet the expectations (e.g., if the first integer is smaller than 1). Additionally, there is no return statement; it merely prints the result instead of returning it. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, processes salaries from `n` companies to find the maximum salary per company, calculates a total based on the differences between the overall maximum and each company's maximum salary multiplied by the number of employees, and prints the accumulated result. **
