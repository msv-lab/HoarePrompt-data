The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by its signature. Instead, it operates on input values which are implied to be provided through standard input. The function processes data for a number of companies, where each company has a specified number of employees and their corresponding salaries. 

Given these relationships:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies.
- Each company is associated with a positive integer `m_i`, which represents the number of employees in that company, followed by `m_i` positive integers that denote the salaries of those employees.

The function returns the result based on the processed salaries of employees across all specified companies.

Functionality: **The function processes input data for a positive integer `n`, representing the number of companies, each followed by the number of employees and their salaries. It returns results based on the analysis of these salaries, ensuring to handle the constraints of employee counts and salary values.**
