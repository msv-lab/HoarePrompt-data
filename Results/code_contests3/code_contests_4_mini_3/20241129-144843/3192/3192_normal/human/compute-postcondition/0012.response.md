The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is either max(0, arr1[2]), which means it can either be 0 or a positive integer. The value of `j` is 3, so we need to evaluate `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `arr1` has at least 4 elements, and we can access `arr1[3]`.

Thus, the new value of `temp` will depend on the comparison between its current value (either 0 or a positive integer) and `arr1[3]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp` based on this comparison.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is updated to be max(previous temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 3**
