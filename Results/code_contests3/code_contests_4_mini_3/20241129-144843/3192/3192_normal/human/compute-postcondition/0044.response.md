The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as no other operations are being executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains `n` values corresponding to the first element of each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, and `ans` is initialized to 0.
