According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
