`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`. The value of `arr1[j]` is the second element of `arr1` (since `j` is 1), which is guaranteed to be an integer. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the value of `arr1[j]` could either be greater than, equal to, or less than `temp`. However, since `temp` starts at 0 and `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list, `temp` will be updated to at least the value of `arr1[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is either `arr1[j]` (if `arr1[j]` > 0) or remains 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is either `arr1[j]` (if `arr1[j]` > 0) or remains 0, `j` is 1**
