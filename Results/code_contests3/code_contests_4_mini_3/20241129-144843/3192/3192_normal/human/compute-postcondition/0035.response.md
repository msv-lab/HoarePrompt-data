According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

Now, since `j` will be incremented by 1, it will become 2 at the start of the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either `arr1[2]` (if `arr1[2]` > 0) or remains 0, `j` is 2**
