According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr1` list. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1`. The current state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is `2`, but these do not directly affect the execution of the loop. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `arr1` must contain at least one element, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1`. Additionally, `j` will start from `1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
