The variable `arr2` is assigned an empty list. This operation does not affect the existing variables `n`, `arr`, or `maxval`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**
