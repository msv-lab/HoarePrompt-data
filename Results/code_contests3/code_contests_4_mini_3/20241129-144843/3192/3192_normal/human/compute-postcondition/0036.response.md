The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[2]`. The value of `temp` can either be `arr1[2]` (if it is greater than 0) or remain 0 if `arr1[2]` is less than or equal to 0. The state of `n`, `i`, and `arr1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either `arr1[2]` (if `arr1[2]` > 0) or remains 0, `j` is 2, and `temp` is max(temp, arr1[2])**
