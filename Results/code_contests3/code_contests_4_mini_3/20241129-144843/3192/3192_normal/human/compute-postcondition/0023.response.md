Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than `arr1[0]`, and no change occurs because the condition for the loop is not satisfied.**
