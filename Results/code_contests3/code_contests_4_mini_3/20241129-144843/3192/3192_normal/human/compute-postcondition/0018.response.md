The code `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits the input string into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr1`. The previous value of `arr1` is replaced, so the original state of `arr1` is no longer valid. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `temp`, `j`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval`) are not affected directly by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is now a list of integers from input, `temp` is the maximum value among new `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] (inclusive), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and the previous `maxval`.**
