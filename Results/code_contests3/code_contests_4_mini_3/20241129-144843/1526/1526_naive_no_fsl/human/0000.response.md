Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies whether the string `w` is beautiful according to the problem description. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads a string input and initializes a dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.

2. It iterates through each character in the string, updating the count in the `memo` dictionary.

3. After counting the characters, it checks each value in the `memo` dictionary to see if any character occurs an odd number of times. If it finds any such character, it sets the `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (indicating that all characters occur an even number of times), and "No" otherwise.

The program handles the constraints correctly, as it only considers lowercase letters and checks for even occurrences. 

Moreover, there are no edge cases that the program does not handle correctly:
- For a string with all characters occurring an even number of times, it correctly returns "Yes".
- For a string with any character occurring an odd number of times, it correctly returns "No".

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented, the program functions as intended for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
