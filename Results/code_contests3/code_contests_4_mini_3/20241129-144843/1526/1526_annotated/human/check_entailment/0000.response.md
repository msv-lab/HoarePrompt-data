Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Method**: The function uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. In Python 3, the correct function to obtain input from the user is `input()`. This discrepancy means that the program would not run correctly in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters, which makes it less flexible. Though the problem allows for input via standard input, it lacks the ability to handle inputs passed directly to the function for testing or other uses.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the results of the even/odd check for character counts, which aligns with the problem description. However, the overall structure of the function and its reliance on direct user input limits its correctness in a broader context, such as automated testing.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**: While the logic in counting occurrences and checking for evenness is correct, the implementation does not handle cases where input might not strictly follow the constraints (even though the problem specifies valid input). If the input were to be changed to include upper-case letters or non-alphabetic characters, the program would still attempt to process them without any error handling.

Thus, while the core logic of checking if all characters in the string occur an even number of times is correct, the issues with input and function structure prevent it from being fully correct according to the problem description.
