Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `memo` is a dictionary where if `c` (the next character in `s`) is not in `memo`, then `memo` is updated with `c` as the key and the value set to 0, ensuring that `s` has at least 2 characters remaining for the loop to execute one more time.***
