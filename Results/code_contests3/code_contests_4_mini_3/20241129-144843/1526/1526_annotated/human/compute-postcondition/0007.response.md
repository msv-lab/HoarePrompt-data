According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the current character from `s`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `c` must be the next character in `s`, and the loop should continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

Since `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and a value of 1, and `w` is a string of lowercase letters, it does not directly affect the state for the next iteration.

If we assume that the loop has processed the first character of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` would be assigned the next character from `s`. Therefore, if `s` has `n` characters, for the loop to execute once more, `n` must be greater than the current index of `c`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and value of 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must have at least 2 characters and `c` is the second character in `s`.**
