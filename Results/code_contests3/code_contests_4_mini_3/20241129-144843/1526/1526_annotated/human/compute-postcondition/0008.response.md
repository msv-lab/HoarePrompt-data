The code assigns the value 0 to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. The previous value of `memo[c]` was 1, but now it is updated to 0. The values of `w` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is now 0**
