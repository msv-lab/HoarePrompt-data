The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry corresponding to a character from `s`, `result` is False, `x` is the value of the first occurrence count in `memo`, and `x` is an odd number, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
