Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry corresponding to a character from `s`, `result` is False, and `x` is the value of the first occurrence count in `memo`. If `x` is odd, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, the state remains unchanged.***
