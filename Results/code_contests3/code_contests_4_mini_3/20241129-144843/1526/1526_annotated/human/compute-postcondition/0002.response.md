According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. The state before the loop indicates that `w` is a string with a length between 1 and 100, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `c` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
