The value of `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The variable `w` remains unaffected and retains its initial value. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, inclusive; `s` is an input string.**
