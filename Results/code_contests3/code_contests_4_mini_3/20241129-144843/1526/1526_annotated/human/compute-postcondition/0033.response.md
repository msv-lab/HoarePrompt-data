Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user consisting of lowercase letters. It counts the occurrences of each character in the string and checks if all characters have even occurrences. The function prints 'Yes' if all characters occur an even number of times, and 'No' if at least one character occurs an odd number of times. There are no parameters for the function, and it directly interacts with the user for input. **
