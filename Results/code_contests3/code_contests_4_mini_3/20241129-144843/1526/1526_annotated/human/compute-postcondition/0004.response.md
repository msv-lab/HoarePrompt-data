`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, where `c` is the first character of the non-empty string `s`. Since `c` is not a key in `memo`, it is added to the dictionary with the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now has `c` as a key with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now has `c` as a key with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s.**
