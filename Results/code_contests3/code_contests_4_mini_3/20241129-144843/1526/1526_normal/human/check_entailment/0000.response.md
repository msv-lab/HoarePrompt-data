The given program is designed to check if a string `w` is "beautiful", which means that each character in the string must occur an even number of times. 

Let's analyze the code:

```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()  # This line is for input, it should be input() in Python 3
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')

func_1()
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Logic**: 
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each character in the string using a dictionary (`memo`).
   - It then checks if all the counts are even by iterating through the values of the dictionary.
   - If any character count is odd, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is `True`, otherwise 'No'.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - A string with all characters the same (e.g., "aaaa") would be beautiful.
   - A string with an odd character count (e.g., "abc") would not be beautiful.
   - A string with just one character (e.g., "a") should return 'No'.
   - Strings with maximum length (100 characters) should also be handled correctly.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks if all characters in the string have even counts and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on that condition. This aligns with what the code is intended to do.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It properly counts the occurrences of each character and checks if they are even. There do not appear to be any edge cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it accurately fulfills the requirement of determining if all characters in the input string appear an even number of times, and it prints the appropriate response based on that evaluation.
