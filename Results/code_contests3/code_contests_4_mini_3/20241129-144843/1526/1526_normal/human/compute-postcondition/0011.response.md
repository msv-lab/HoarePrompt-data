According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates through each character in `s`, and at the end of the last iteration, the character `c` is the last character iterated from `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, there are more characters to iterate through.

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo[c]` has been updated based on the last character `c` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` must be the next character in `s` after the last character that was processed.

If `s` has `n` characters, and if the loop has processed `n-1` characters, then `c` would be the `n`-th character (the last character) in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the next character in `s`, which can be represented as the `n`-th character.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is updated for the next character in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be the next character in `s`.**
