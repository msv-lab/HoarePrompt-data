According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is not an empty string, as it iterates over each character in `s`. The state of `w` and `memo` does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

For the loop to be executed the first time, `s` must be a non-empty string, and the character `c` will be initialized to the first character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character in `s`**
