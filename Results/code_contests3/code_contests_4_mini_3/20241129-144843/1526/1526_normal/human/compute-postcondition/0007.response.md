According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters remaining, the loop will execute one more time for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` contains `c`, which is either `1` or has been incremented by `1`. Since `c` iterates over each character in `s`, the loop will continue until all characters have been processed.

If `c` is the last character in `s`, then the loop cannot execute again. However, if `c` is not the last character, then we can find the next character in `s` for the next iteration.

Thus, if `c` had been incremented by `1`, it signifies that the loop has processed one character already. We need to adjust the state such that `c` points to the next character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains `c` with value either `1` or incremented by `1`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must have at least one more character remaining.**
