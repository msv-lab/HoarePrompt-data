Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`, and `c` is the first character in `s`. If `c` is already in `memo`, there are no changes to `memo`.***
