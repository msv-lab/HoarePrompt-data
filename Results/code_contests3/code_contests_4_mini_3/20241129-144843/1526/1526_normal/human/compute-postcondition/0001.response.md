The code initializes an empty dictionary assigned to the variable `memo`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary.**
