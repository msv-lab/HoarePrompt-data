The variable `c` is either a new key in `memo` or an existing key. If `c` is a new key, then `memo[c]` is incremented from `0` to `1`. If `c` already exists in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is incremented by `1` from its previous value. Since the exact state of `memo` before the operation is not provided and depends on whether `c` was already present or not, the output state describes both scenarios. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains `c` with value either `1` (if it was previously not in `memo`) or incremented by `1` (if it was already in `memo`).

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains `c` with value either `1` or incremented by `1`**
