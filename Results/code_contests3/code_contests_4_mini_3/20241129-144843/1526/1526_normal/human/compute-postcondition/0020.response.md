The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains at least one key-value pair, `result` is False, `x` is the first value from `memo.values()`, and `x` is an odd integer (x % 2 > 0) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
