According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `memo`. The loop iterates over the values in `memo`, and since `memo` contains at least one key-value pair, it can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer (the first value from `memo.values()`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `memo` must have at least one more value left to iterate over. If the loop has executed once with the first value of `memo.values()`, the next value of `x` will be the second value in `memo.values()`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains at least two key-value pairs, `result` is False, and `x` is the second value from `memo.values()`**
