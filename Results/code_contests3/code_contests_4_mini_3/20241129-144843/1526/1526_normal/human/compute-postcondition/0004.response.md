The variable `memo` is assigned a new key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is `0`. Since `c` is the first character in the non-empty string `s` and it is not present in the empty dictionary `memo`, the dictionary will now contain one entry. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`, and `c` is the first character in `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`, and `c` is the first character in `s.**
