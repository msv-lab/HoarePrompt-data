To determine if the provided program correctly identifies beautiful strings, let's analyze the program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
A string `w` is considered beautiful if every lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times.

### Program Analysis:
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

### Step-by-step Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from standard input.
2. **Counting Characters**: It uses a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character.
3. **Checking Even Occurrences**: The program iterates over the values in `memo` to check if each character count is even. If any count is odd, it sets `result` to `False`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is `True` (indicating the string is beautiful), and 'No' otherwise.

### Edge Case Consideration:
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- If the input string has characters that all occur an even number of times, the program will correctly return 'Yes'.
- If the input string has a character that occurs an odd number of times, the program will correctly return 'No'.
  
However, the program uses `raw_input()` which is specific to Python 2. If this code were to run in Python 3, `raw_input()` would raise an error, potentially causing the program to fail before any logic is executed.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program is not compatible with Python 3 due to the use of `raw_input()`, it cannot handle input as expected in a modern Python environment. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases because it would not function correctly in all contexts.

Correctness: **False**.
