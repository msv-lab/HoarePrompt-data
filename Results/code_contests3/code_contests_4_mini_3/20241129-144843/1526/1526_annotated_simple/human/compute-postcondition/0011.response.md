According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `c` is the last character processed from `s`. Since the loop operates on each character in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next character in the string `s`. 

If `s` has at least 2 characters, and if we are at the first character (when `c` is the first character), the loop can execute for the second character. After processing the second character, `c` will be set to the third character if it exists. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `c` must refer to the next character in the string, and the index of `c` will increment by 1.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `memo` is a dictionary where the value of key `c` has been incremented, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be the next character in `s`, and the loop index is now 1 (for the second character)**.
