The variable `result` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of `w`, `s`, and `memo` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables, but `result` is now explicitly set to `True`. 

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string from the user, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that character in `s`, `result` is True**.
