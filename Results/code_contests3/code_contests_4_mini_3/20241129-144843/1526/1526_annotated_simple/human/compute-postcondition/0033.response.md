Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters, counts the occurrences of each character, and checks if all characters have even counts. If all characters have even counts, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If the string is empty or contains only odd counts, the function will still handle it correctly by returning 'No' in such cases. **
