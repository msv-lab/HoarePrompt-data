The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string from the user, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries corresponding to the characters in `s`, `result` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
