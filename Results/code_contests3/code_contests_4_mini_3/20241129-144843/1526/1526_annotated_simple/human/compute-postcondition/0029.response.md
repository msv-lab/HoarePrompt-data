Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string from the user, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries corresponding to the characters in `s`, and `x` is the next value from `memo.values()`. If `x` is an odd number (`x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modification to `result`.***
