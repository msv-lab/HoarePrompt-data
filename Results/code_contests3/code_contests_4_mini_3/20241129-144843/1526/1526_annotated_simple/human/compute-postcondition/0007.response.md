According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 for the current character `c`. Since `s` is non-empty, and `c` represents the current character that has been processed, we need to determine the next character in `s` that the loop will process.

Assuming that the loop has processed the first character of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still characters left in `s`. If `c` is the current character, to execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next character in `s`. The next character will be `c` being the second character in `s`, and `s` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` having value 1, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be the second character in `s`.**
