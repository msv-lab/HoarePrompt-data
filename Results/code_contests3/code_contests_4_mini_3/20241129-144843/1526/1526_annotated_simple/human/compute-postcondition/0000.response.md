The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial state of `w` is not affected by this assignment, but `s` will now contain the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`) with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive; `s` is an input string from the user.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`) with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive; `s` is an input string from the user.**
