Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string from the user, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry corresponding to the characters in `s`, `result` is False if `x` is an odd element from the dictionary `memo`, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, there is no change to `result` or the overall state of the program.***
