According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is an input string from the user, it can be of any length, including 0. However, since the problem states that `w` is a string with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive, we can assume that `s` also needs to be non-empty for the loop to execute at least once.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `s` is not an empty string and has at least one character. The variable `c` will represent the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string from the user, `memo` is an empty dictionary, and `c` is the first character of `s`.**
