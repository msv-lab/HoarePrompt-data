To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it aligns with the requirements laid out in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must determine if a given string `w` is "beautiful," which means that every lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in `w`. The output should be "Yes" if `w` is beautiful and "No" otherwise.

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a string `s` from user input.
   
2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character in the string. 
   - For every character `c` in the string `s`, if `c` is not already in `memo`, it initializes its count to 0, then increments the count by 1.

3. **Checking Even Counts**:
   - The program initializes a variable `result` to `True`.
   - It then iterates over the values in `memo` (which represent the counts of each character).
   - If any character count is odd (i.e., `x % 2 > 0`), it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (indicating all characters have even counts), or "No" if `result` is `False`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Input Constraints**: The program adheres to the input constraints (1 ≤ |w| ≤ 100 and lowercase letters).
- **Counting Logic**: The counting logic accurately counts occurrences of each character.
- **Evenness Check**: The program correctly checks if each character occurs an even number of times.
- **Output Format**: The output format matches the requirement of printing "Yes" or "No".

### Conclusion:
The program fulfills all requirements set forth in the problem description. It correctly identifies whether the string is beautiful based on the even occurrence of characters and provides the appropriate output.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
