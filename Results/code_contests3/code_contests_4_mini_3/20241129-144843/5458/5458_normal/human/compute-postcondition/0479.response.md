The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
