The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

To analyze the indices:
- `i` is `2`, so `i + 1` is `3`. The expression `3 & 1` evaluates to `1` (since `3` in binary is `11`, and `1` in binary is `01`, resulting in `01` which is `1`).
- `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` is `4`.
- `k` is `2`.

Thus, the assignment targets `dp[1][4][2]`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`, the assignment does not affect the bounds or the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. 

The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged after this assignment, while the value at `dp[1][4][2]` is set to `1`.

The Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
