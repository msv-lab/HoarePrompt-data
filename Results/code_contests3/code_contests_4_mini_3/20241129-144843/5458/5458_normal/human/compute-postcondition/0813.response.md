The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop, if there is one, and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `m`, and the `dp` array remain unchanged, the output state reflects that.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `dp` array at index `[1][5][3]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
