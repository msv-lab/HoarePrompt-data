Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `s`, `s` is at least 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.***
