According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be either 1 or 2, and `m` is at least 1. 

If `j` is 1, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 2. If `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3, allowing `j` to increment to 3. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust the state accordingly. If `j` is currently 1, it will be incremented to 2. If `j` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3, but this is only possible if `m` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `dp` will be updated based on the values of `j` and `k`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be at least 2, `j` will be 2 or 3 depending on the last executed iteration, and `i` will be 0 or 1.**
