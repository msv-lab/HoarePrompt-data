The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][4]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
