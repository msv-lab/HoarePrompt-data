The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the Output State reflects that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at the current state, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
