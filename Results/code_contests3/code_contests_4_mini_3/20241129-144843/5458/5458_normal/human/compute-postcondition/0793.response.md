Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, the assignment to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be resolved without values for `dp` and `mod.***
