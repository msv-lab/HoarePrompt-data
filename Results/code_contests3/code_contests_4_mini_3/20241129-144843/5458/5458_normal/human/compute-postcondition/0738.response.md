The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 1; `dp` has been updated at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
