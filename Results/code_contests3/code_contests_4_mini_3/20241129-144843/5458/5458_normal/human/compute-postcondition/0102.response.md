Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the loop will not continue, but `s` must remain at least 3 for a second iteration to occur.***
