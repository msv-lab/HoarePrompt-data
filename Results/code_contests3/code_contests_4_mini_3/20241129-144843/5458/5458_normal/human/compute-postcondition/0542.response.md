Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
