Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is at the current state; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
