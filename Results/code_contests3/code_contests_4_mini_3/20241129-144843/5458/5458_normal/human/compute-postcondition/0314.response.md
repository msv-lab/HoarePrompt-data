The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `dp` is fully updated based on the values of `j` from 1 to `M` and `k` from 1 to `S`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
