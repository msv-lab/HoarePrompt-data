According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. The loop is set to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
