According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Currently, we know:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7.
- `i` is `N + 1`, which means `i` is at least 2.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

In order for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is set appropriately. Since `k` starts from 1 and goes to `s`, for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. If we want the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

Thus, we can conclude:
- `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

Now we can summarize the required states:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1**.
