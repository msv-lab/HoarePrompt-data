Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is `N + 2` (ranging from 3 to 9), `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
