Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets defined by positive integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7, M is between 1 and 2000, and S is between 1 and 3000, terminating when all inputs are zero. For each dataset, the function calculates a value using a dynamic programming approach and outputs the result of the computation `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % 100000` for each valid input set. The function does not define the output specifics beyond this computational result. **
