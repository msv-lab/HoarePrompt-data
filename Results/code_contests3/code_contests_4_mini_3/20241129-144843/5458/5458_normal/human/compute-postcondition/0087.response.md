Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, and `j` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][2] to 1; otherwise, there is no update to `dp`. If `i` is 1, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and the rest of the current iteration is skipped.***
