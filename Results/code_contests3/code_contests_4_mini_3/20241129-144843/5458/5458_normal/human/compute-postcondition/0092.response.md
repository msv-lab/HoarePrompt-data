The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables do not change due to this command. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
