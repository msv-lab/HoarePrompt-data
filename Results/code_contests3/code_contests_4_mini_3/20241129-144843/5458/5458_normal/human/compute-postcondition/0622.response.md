Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `n^2 - 1`; `dp` has been fully updated; `n` is at least 1; `m` is at least 1; `s` is at least 1; and we print `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod.`**
