Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; if `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, if `i` is 1 or larger, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, with the condition that `m` is greater than `j`.***
