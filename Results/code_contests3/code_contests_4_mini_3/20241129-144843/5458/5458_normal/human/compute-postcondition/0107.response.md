Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `dp` will be fully updated based on the values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. Specifically, for each `j`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will take the value from `dp[1][j][k]`. Otherwise, it will be the sum of previous values in the `dp` array considering the modulus operation. The final state of `dp` will reflect all calculations performed during the iterations.**
