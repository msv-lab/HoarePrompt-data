The command `continue` does not affect the values of the variables. It simply skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 2`, which ranges from 3 to 9; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k` (j > 1) and we continue in the loop.**
