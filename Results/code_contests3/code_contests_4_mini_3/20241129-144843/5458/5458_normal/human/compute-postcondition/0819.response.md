In the given code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array. Let's analyze the components:

1. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it is relevant within the context of the `dp` array.
2. `j` is given as 4, so `j + 1` becomes 5.
3. `k` is given as 4, which remains unchanged.
4. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i` (if `i` is even, it evaluates to 0, if odd, it evaluates to 1).
5. The value of `dp[1][5][4]` is set to 1.

Since we don't have the specific value of `i`, we acknowledge that the output can depend on its value. However, we can conclude that `dp` at the calculated indices gets assigned a value.

Therefore, the output state indicating the change in `dp` is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `dp[1][5][4]` is 1**
