The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, but it indicates that the loop will continue executing from the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at the current state, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
