Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. In this case, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. The loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made.***
