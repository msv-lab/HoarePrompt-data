According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` starting from 1 to `s`. Since `s` is at least 7, the loop can execute as long as `k` starts at 1 and can go up to the value of `s`. The initial state given indicates `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `s` is at least 7, which means the loop can indeed execute. 

To summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

1. `k` starts at 1.
2. The loop will iterate until `k` reaches `s`, which is at least 7.
3. There are no additional conditions that would prevent the loop from executing given the constraints.

Thus, the state needs to indicate that `k` starts at 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
