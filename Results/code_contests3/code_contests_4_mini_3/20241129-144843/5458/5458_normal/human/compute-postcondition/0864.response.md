According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to execute from `1` to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least `N`, the value of `s` must be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, it guarantees that `s` will also be at least 1. 

As it stands, `k` is initialized as `s`, and in the loop header, `k` will take values from `1` to `s`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `k` should be equal to `s` which is at least `1`, and `i` is `N + 2`, `j` is `m + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `j`. 

Thus, the necessary states are:
1. `s` is at least `1`.
2. `k` is initialized as `s`.
3. `i` is `N + 2`.
4. `j` is `m + 1` and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `j`.

In this case, we can summarize:
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s`, `j` is `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be at least `j`**
