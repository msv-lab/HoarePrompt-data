According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to run for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and `s` has not been specified, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a fourth time. Therefore, `k` will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `s` must be at least 4.**
