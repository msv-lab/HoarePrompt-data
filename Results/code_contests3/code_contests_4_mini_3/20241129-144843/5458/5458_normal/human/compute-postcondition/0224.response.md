According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will run as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`. 

Since the loop starts with `k = 1` and continues until `k` reaches `s`, the next value of `k` would be `s + 1`. 

The value of `i` and `j` does not change in this context, nor does `N` affect the execution of the loop directly. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least `s + 1`.**
