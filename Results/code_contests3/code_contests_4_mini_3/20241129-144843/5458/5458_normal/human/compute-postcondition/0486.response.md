According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, starting from `k = 1` up to `k = s`. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `s` must be at least 4 (since `k` takes values 1, 2, 3, 4 for the first four iterations). The variables `i` and `j` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution. The initial value of `i` is 0 and `j` is 4, but they do not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute a fourth time, we need to ensure `s` is at least 4, and `k` will start from 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `s` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 1**
