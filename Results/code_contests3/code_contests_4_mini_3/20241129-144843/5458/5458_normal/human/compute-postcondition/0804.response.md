The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2 (after the first iteration), `m` is at least 4, `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
