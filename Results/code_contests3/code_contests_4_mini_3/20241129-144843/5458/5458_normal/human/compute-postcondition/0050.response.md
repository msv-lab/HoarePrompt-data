The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since other variables and states are not modified by this statement directly, we check the previous values of the affected variables. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged, and we are breaking out of the current iteration of the loop to continue with the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than `k` (j > 2), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
