Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
