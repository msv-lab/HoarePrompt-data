According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means it has executed once already. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, the maximum value of `n` can be 7, leading to a maximum of `n ** 2` being 49. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is at least 1 (which it is).

After incrementing `i` by 1 for the next iteration, the new value of `i` will be 2. Therefore, the loop will still be able to execute again since `2 < n ** 2` holds true for any positive integer `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 1**.
