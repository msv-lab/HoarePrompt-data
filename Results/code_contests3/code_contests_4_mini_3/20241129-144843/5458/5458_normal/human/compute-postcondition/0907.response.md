Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 2`, which ranges from 3 to 9; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue in the loop, indicating that `j` is greater than 1; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
