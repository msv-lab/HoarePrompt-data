Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0 and `dp` is a list of lists initialized with dimensions (2) x (m + 2) with each element set to 0, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then the operation could not be completed due to invalid indexing of `dp`.***
