The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `i` is 2, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which is `1` (because in binary, 3 is `11` and 1 is `01`, resulting in `01`). The variable `j` is 3, so `j + 1` is `4`. The value of `k` remains `3`. 

Thus, the assignment translates to:
```
dp[1][4][3] = dp[1][3][3]
```

Since the output state does not specify the contents of the `dp` array, but we can state what has happened without that information. The other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`.**
