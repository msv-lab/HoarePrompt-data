The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves several components. First, we need to calculate `i + 1 & 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we perform the following calculation:

1. `i + 1` becomes `2 + 1`, which equals `3`.
2. The operation `3 & 1` is a bitwise AND operation. In binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`. The result of `3 & 1` is `01`, which is `1` in decimal.

Next, we evaluate `j + 1`, where `j` is 3:

1. `j + 1` becomes `3 + 1`, which equals `4`.

Now we can summarize the indexing in `dp`:

- The computed index for `i + 1 & 1` is `1`.
- The computed index for `j + 1` is `4`.
- The index for `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` translates to `dp[1][4][1] = 1`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment, so the output state remains focused on the changes made by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1**.
