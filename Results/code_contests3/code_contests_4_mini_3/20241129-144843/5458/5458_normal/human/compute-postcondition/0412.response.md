Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, and `j + 1` is either 3 or 4, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
