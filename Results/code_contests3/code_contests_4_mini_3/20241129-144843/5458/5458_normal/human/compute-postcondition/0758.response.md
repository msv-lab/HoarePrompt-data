Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `s` must be greater than or equal to `s + 1`; if `j` is greater than `k`, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
