Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at the current state, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
