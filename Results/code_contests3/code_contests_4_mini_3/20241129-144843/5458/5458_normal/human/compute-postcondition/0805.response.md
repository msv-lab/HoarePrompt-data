Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2 (after the first iteration), `m` is at least 4. Since `j` (which is 4) is greater than `k` (which is 2), the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
