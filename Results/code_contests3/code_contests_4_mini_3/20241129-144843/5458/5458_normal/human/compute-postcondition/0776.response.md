According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2, and it must be that `s` is at least 2.**
