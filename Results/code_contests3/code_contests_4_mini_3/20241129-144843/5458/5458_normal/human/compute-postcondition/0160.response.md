The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `N`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, but it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed and moves to the next iteration. Since we do not have specific information about the context of the loop or any additional operations that might follow, we can conclude that the values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
