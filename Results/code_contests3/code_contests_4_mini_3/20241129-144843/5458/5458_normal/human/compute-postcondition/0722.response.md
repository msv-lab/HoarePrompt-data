Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues for a second iteration.***
