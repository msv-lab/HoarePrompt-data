Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no action is executed. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`.***
