Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is `s + 1`; `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][4][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` is at least 4, and `dp[0][4][k]` is updated by adding `dp[1][3][k - 3] % mod` to it.***
