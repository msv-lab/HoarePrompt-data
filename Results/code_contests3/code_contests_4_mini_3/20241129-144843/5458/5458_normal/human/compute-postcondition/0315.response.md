Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `dp` is fully updated based on the values of `j` from 1 to `M` and `k` from 1 to `S`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
