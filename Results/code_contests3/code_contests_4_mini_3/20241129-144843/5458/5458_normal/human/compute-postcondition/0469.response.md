The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` affects the `dp` array. Given that `i` is 0, we calculate `i + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1 = 1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]`. 

From the initial state, we also know:
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and
- `k` is 2.

Since `j` must be at least 2 (to be greater than or equal to `k`), we can deduce:
- `j + 1` will be at least 3.

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will take the value from `dp[1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, and the previous values in the `dp` array) do not change.

The output state summarizes the current values and the effect of the assignment:
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `k` is 2,
- `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]**
