According to the code, the loop continues based on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 4 in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute a fourth time, `m` must be at least 4 (since `j` will now be 4). 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` will become 4.
- `N` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, but it does not directly impact the execution of the loop in this context.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
