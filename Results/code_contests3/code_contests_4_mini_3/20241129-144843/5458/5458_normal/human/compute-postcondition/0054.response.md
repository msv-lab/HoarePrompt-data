Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than 2, the assignment does not occur. If `i` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
