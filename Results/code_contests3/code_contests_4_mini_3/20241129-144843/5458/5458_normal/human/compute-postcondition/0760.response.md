Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`. If `i` equals 0, the program does not execute further statements as the loop does not execute. If `i` is not 0 and `s` is required to be greater than or equal to `s + 1`, which is not possible, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
