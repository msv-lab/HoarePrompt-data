Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, then when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `dp[0][3][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][2][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `k` is `s + 1` and `s` is at least 1 for the second execution, with `k` being 1 for the first execution.***
