Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state.***
