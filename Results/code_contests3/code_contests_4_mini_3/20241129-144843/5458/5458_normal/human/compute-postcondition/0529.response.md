The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement, but we exit the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
