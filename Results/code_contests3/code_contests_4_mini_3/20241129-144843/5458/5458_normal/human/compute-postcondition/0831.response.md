According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`. 

Given the current states: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is `N + 2`, `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` is 2, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 for the first execution of the loop.

Additionally, since the loop is set to execute a second time, it indicates that `s` must be at least 2. 

So for the loop to execute for the first time, `s` should be at least 1, and for it to execute a second time, `s` should be at least 2. 

The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` do not directly influence the execution of the loop in this context.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, for the loop to execute at least twice `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1**
