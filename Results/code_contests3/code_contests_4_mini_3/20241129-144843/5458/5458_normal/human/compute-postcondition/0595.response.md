The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and immediately proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program continues to the next iteration without altering the values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1 or larger, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than `j`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
