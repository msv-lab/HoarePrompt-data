The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i` is 0 and `k` is 3. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is 1. Thus, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. The variable `j` is not provided, so its value is unknown, but the operation does not affect the values of `N`, `i`, or `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.**
