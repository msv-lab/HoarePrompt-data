The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables directly but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no other variables being affected or assignments being made in this context, the output state remains unchanged, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
