Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` has been updated at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
