The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[0][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][1][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
