Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, continuing to the next iteration without changes to the other variables. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to the variables.***
