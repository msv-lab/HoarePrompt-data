Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `s`, and `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][s]` is set to 1 for all k ≤ s. Otherwise, `dp[0][3][k]` is updated based on the previous values of `dp` for all k ≤ s.**
