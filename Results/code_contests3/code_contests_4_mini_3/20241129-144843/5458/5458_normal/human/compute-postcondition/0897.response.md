According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1 because the range starts at 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, this means `s` must also be at least `N`, which is at least 1. Therefore, `s` meets the condition to allow the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `k` is initialized to `1`. This means that during the first iteration of the loop, `k` will take the value of `1`, which is valid for the loop range. 

Since the loop is structured to execute from `k` equal to `1` up to `s`, and `s` is at least `N`, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as long as `s` is at least `1`.

Thus, the required states before the loop execution need to reflect that `s` is at least `1`, and `k` starts at `1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1**
