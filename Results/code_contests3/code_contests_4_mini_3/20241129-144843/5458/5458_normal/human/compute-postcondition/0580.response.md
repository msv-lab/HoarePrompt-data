The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
