The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
