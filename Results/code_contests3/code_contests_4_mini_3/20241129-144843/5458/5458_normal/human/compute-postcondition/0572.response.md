Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then no changes occur in the variables.***
