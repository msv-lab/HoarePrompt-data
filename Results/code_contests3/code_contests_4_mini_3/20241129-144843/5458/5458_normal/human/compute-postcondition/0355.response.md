The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in the `dp` array. The indices used for this assignment are `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`.

1. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`. 
2. The operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
3. The value of `j` is adjusted to `2` if it was `1` or `1` if it was `0`. Given that `j` is less than or equal to `m` and greater than or equal to `k`, we can assume that `j` can be `1` or `2` based on its previous value. After the adjustment, we assume `j` is `2`.
4. The value of `k` is not specified, but we can assume it's some value that meets the conditions stated.

Therefore, the assignment affects the `dp` array at the indices `[1][3][k]` (where `3` comes from `j + 1` which equals `2 + 1`).

Other variables are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `j` is adjusted to 2, `k` is some value satisfying the conditions.**
