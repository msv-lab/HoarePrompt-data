The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the loop to skip the remaining statements and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we are still in the loop's context.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
