According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2 since `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2.**
