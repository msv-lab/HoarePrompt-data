According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1. Thus, after this iteration, `k` will be 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` will go from 1 to 2 to 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
