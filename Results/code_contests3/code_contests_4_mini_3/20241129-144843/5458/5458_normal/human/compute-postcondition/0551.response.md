Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 and `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, which is less than or equal to `s`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
