According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1) and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2, and `s` must be at least 2 to allow `k` to be within the range of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, k is 2.**
