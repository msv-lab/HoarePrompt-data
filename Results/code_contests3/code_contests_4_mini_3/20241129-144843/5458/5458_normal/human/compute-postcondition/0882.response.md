Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at the current state, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2 with `k` equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the next iteration of the loop is initiated.***
