Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` (j > 2); `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
