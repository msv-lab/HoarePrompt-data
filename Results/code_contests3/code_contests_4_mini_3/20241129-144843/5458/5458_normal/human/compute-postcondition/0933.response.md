The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is designed to process multiple datasets defined by positive integers N, M, and S, where N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and S is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The input is terminated when N, M, and S are all zero, and the number of datasets does not exceed 5. The output of the function is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process a limited number of datasets based on the specified constraints and relationships of N, M, and S.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets defined by positive integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7, M is between 1 and 2000, and S is between 1 and 3000, terminating when all inputs are zero. The output specifics are not defined.**
