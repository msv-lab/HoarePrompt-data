According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N` where `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. Since the loop iterates while `i` is less than `n ** 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently `N`, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be `N + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `N + 1` is less than `n ** 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the conditions are:
- `N` must be at least 1 and at most 7,
- `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than `N + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than `N + 1`**.
