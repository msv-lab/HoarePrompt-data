The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
