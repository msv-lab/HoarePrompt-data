Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, and for each `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.**
