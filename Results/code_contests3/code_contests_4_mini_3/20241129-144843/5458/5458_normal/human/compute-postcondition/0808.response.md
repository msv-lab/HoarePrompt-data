Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, then `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 4, and the `dp` array has been updated at index `[1][5][2]` to 1. Otherwise, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 4, and an attempt to access the invalid index `k - j`, which is -2, occurs.***
