Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `j` and `k` after adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
