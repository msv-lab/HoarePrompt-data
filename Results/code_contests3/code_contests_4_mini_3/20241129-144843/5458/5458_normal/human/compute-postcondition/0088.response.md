According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has a value of 1 (the starting point of the range), and `s` is at least 3. This means that for the loop to execute again, `k` must increase to 2. 

Since `k` starts at 1 and the loop iterates while `k` goes up to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be updated to 2. The condition for `k` being less than or equal to `s` holds true since `s` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2**
