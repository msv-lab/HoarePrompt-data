According to the code, the `while 1:` loop is an infinite loop, meaning it will always execute unless there is a break statement or an external interruption. Since it will certainly execute at least once regardless of the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or `mod`, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is set to 100000**.
