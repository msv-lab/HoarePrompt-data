Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is the maximum value reached during the iterations; `i` is unchanged; `j` has been incremented based on the conditions within the loop; `k` is equal to `s + 1` after all iterations; `dp` has been updated according to the rules defined in the loop, reflecting the cumulative results based on the previous states of `dp`.**
