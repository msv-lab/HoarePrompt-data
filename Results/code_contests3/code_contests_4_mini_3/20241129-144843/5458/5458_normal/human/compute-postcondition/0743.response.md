According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, since `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7,
- `i` is `N + 1`,
- `k` is currently `s`.

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be `s + 1`**
