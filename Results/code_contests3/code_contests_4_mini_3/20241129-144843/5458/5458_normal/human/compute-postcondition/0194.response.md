Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 5, `s` is at least 5; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][5][4]` is assigned the value 1, and `dp[1][5][5]` is referenced but not altered, continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the state remains unchanged.***
