According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and since `s` is at least 2, it can execute again for `k = 3`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is currently 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` will be 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be 3.**
