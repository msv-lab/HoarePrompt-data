According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will iterate for each integer `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. 

Given the initial state where `j` is `m + 1`, it means that before the loop starts, `j` is currently set to a value that is beyond the range of the loop (as it will start from 1 and go up to `m`, but is initially `m + 1`). 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1, and we need to reset `j` to 1 (the starting value of the loop). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1.**
