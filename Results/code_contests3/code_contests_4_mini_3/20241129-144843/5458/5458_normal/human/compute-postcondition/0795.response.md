According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4 (since `j` will increment by 1). After incrementing, `j` will become 4.

Therefore, the modified state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` is now 4, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 4.**
