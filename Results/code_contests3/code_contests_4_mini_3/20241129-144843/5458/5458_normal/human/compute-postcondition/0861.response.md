Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0, the assignment to `dp` is attempted but cannot be fully determined due to missing information. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
