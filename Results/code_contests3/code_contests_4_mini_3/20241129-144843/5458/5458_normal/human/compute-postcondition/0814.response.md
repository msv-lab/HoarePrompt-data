Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, and the `dp` array at index `[1][5][2]` has been updated to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the `dp` array at index `[1][5][3]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped.***
