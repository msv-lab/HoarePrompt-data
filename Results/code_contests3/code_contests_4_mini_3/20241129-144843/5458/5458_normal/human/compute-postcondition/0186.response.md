The value of `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `k` is 4. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which is `1` (in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, so `11 & 01` is `01`, which is `1`). 

Now, since `j` (4) is not greater than `k` (4), there are no actions executed as per the given condition. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and no action is executed since `j` is not greater than `k`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and no action is executed since `j` is not greater than `k`.**
