Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to `k + 1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `k` or `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
