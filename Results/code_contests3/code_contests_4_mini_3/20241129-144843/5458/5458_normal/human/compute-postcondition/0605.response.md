Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
