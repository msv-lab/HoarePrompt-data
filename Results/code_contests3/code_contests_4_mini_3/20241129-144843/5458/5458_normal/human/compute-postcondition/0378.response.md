The value of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement will skip the current iteration of the loop without affecting any variable values directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is incremented to `k + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
