Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is `s`, and `i` is either 0 or 1. The `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for each corresponding `k`. If `i` is 1, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` will be updated according to the logic in the loop. Overall, `dp` will reflect combinations based on the values of `j` and `k` after all iterations.**
