The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `n^2 - 1`; `dp` has been fully updated; `n` is the first value from the input; `m` is the second value from the input; `s` is the third value from the input; and we print `dp[n]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
