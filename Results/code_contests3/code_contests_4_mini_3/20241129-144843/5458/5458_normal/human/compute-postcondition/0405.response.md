The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. This operation modifies the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the modulo operation with `mod`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `j` and `k` after adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
