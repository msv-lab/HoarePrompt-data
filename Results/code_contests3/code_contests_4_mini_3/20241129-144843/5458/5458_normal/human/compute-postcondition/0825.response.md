Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `dp[1][5][2]` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][4]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][4]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
