Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s`, and `j` is `m + 1`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop skips to the next iteration; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is computed using the previous values in the array as described.***
