The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
