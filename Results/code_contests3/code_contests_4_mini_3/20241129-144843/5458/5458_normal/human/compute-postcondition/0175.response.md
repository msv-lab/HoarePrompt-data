According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1 to 4. Therefore, `m` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is `s`, and `dp` has been updated according to the conditions checked throughout the iterations for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a fourth time `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
