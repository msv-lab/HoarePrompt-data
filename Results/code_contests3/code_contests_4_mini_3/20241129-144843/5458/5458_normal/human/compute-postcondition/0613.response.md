The code snippet `continue` does not change any variable values but instead instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the loop continues. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute again; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
