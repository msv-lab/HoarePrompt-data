Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 1; `k` is equal to 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod.***
