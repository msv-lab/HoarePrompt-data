The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, and `dp` remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
