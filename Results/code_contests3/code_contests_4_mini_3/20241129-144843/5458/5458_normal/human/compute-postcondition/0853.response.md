According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `s` must be at least 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
