According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value (which can be inferred as less than or equal to `s` since the loop condition starts from 1), thus for the loop to execute a second time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, and the conditions regarding `i`, `j`, and `s`, we can conclude that as long as `k` is less than `s`, the next iteration can occur.

So, if `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`, and it will be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`, and `k` will be incremented by 1.**
