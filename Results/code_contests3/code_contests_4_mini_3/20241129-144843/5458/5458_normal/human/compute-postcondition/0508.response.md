According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 3 for the next iteration. Since `s` is already greater than or equal to 4, it will satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 3**
