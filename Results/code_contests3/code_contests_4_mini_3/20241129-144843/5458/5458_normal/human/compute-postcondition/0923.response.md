The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop in which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time; `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
