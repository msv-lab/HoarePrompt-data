The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop, if we were directly inside one. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
