Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[1][4][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3][0] % mod` to it.***
