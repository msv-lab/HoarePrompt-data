The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but we are skipping the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the first execution, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
