The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `k` has the value `s + 1`, and the variable `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulus of another value from the array `dp`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
