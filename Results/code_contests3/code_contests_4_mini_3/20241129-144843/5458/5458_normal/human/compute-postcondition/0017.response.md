The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
