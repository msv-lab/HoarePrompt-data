According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and therefore `m` must be at least 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 3.**
