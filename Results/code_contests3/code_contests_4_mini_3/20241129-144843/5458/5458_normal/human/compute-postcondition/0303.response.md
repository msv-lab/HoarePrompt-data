The value of the variables does not change with the `continue` statement; it simply causes the loop to skip the remaining statements and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 1; `s` is at least 2; `dp[0][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
