Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is adjusted based on the last iteration, `dp` is updated based on the values of `j` and `k`, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `j` is adjusted to 2 if it was 1 or 1 if it was 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
