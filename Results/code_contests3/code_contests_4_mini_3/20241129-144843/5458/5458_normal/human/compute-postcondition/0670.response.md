The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
