Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
