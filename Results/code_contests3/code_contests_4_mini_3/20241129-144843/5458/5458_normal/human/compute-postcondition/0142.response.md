According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3 (since `j` will be 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
