The line of code performs an assignment operation based on the existing values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` simplifies to `3 & 1`, which evaluates to `1`, as `i` is `2`. The value of `j + 1` is `4`, and the value of `k` remains `3`. 

The output state will reflect the updated value in the `dp` array as follows:

`dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`, but since there is no specific information provided for `dp` values, we cannot determine the actual numerical values. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`.**
