Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1 or larger, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than `j`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
