Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
