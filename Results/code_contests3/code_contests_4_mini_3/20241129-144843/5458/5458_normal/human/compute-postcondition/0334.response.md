Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `dp` has at least one value set to 1 at indices `[1][j + 1][2]`, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then the above conditions hold true.***
