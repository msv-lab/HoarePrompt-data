The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves an assignment to a multi-dimensional list or array `dp`. The specific indices being accessed are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` computes the value of the expression where `i` is currently 0. Thus, it evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1`. This results in `1`.
2. The value of `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` results in `3`.
3. The value of `k` remains `2`.

Therefore, the expression `dp[1][3][2] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the specified indices.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 2

No other variables are affected. 

The Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
