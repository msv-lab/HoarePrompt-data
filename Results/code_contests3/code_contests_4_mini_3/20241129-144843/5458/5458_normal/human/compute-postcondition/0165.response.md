According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which starts at 1 and continues while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The current state indicates that `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, and it is not directly affecting the loop's execution in this case, we only need to focus on the value of `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
