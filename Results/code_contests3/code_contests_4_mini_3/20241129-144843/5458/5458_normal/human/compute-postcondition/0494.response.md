The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
