Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
