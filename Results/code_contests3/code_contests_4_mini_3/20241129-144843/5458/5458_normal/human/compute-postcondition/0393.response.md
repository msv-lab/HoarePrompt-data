The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2 or 3; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
