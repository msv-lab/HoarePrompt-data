Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time; `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
