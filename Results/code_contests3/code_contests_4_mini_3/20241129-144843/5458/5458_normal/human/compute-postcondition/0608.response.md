Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to its previous value.***
