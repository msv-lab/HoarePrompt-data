The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will change based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on its previous value and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on its previous value and the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
