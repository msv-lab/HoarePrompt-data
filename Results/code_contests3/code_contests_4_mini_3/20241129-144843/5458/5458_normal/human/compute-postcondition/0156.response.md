According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. The ending state indicates that `k` is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since the loop will increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration, it will then be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and there are no additional constraints on `s`, we can infer that `s` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
