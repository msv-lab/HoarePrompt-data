The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is `s`, `s` is at least 2, `dp[0][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.
