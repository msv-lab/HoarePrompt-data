The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is 1. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. The value of `k` is 4. Therefore, the assignment `dp[1][3][4] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the specified indices. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][3][4] = 1**
