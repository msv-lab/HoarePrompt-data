Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
