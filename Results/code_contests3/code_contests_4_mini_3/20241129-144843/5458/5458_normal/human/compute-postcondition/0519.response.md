According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `n ** 2`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, the maximum value for `n ** 2` can be 49 (when `N` is 7). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` has been updated according to all operations performed in the loop.**
