The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
