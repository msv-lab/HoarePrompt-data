The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
