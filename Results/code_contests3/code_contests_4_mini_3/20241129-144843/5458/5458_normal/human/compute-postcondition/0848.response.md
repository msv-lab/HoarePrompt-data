The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is encountered, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 2` (between 3 and 9); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
