According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute `s` times, starting with `k` initialized to 1. Since `i` is 2, it indicates that this is the second iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied since `N` is within the range 1 to 7, allowing for possible values of `s`. At the beginning of the second iteration, `k` should be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
