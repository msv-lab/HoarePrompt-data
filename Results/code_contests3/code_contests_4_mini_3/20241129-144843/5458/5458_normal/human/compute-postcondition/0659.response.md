Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
