Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, an invalid index access occurred while attempting to update `dp[0][3][1]`.***
