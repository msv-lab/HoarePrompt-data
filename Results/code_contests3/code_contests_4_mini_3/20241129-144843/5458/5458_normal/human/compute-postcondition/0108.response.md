According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, the maximum value for `n` can be 7, which means `n ** 2` can be at most 49. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. After the current iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` which is still true since `n` can be at most 7 (hence, `n ** 2` is at least 4 when `N` is 2).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n ** 2` must be greater than 2**.
