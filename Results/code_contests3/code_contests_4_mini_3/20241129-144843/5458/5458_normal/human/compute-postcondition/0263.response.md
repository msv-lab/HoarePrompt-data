The value of `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. Given that `j` (2) is not greater than `k` (2), the condition is false, so we do not skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Next, we will compute the value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates as follows:
- `i + 1` is `4`
- `4 & 1` results in `0` (since 4 in binary is `100` and 1 is `001`, the bitwise AND gives `000` which is `0`).

Next, we find `j + 1`, which is `3`. 

Now we have:
- `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2] % mod`.

The output state will reflect the computed value assignment, but since we don't have the specific values of `dp` or `mod`, we cannot specify those in the output.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 2; the condition of `j > k` is false; `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 2; the condition of `j > k` is false; `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2] % mod.**
