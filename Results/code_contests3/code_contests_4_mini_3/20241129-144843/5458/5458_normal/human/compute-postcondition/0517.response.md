To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can analyze the provided details of the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

From the loop code, we see that:
- The loop iterates over `k` from `1` to `s`.
- If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.
- If `i` is not `0` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using values from the previous state.
- In other cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using a modulo operation to ensure it fits within a certain range.

Given that the loop executes through `k` values from `1` to `s` and that `j` remains `4` throughout the loop execution, we observe the following:
- For `k = 1`, `2`, `3`, since `j (4)` is greater than or equal to each of these values, `dp[1][5][k]` will be assigned `1` for all cases.

After the loop has executed for all values of `k` from `1` to `s` (assuming `s` is at least `4`), the final state of the relevant variables will be:
- `i` remains `0`, as it does not change during the iterations.
- `j` remains `4`, as it is also unchanged.
- `k` will be `s`, which is the last value in the range of the loop.
- The `dp` array will have values updated for `k = 1`, `2`, `3`, and since `dp[1][5][k]` is set to `1` for these values, they will remain as such.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:
- `dp[1][5][1]` is `1`
- `dp[1][5][2]` is `1`
- `dp[1][5][3]` is `1`
- `dp[1][5][4]` will be updated based on the last condition.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is `s`, and `dp[1][5][1]`, `dp[1][5][2]`, `dp[1][5][3]` are 1, with `dp[1][5][4]` updated accordingly.**
