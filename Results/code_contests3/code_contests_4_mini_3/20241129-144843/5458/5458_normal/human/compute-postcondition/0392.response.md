The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. To evaluate this expression, we need to determine the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. Given `i` is 1, we have `i + 1 = 2`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which is `0` (binary AND operation).
2. The value of `j` can be either 2 or 3. For `j + 1`, if `j` is 2, then `j + 1` is 3; if `j` is 3, then `j + 1` is 4.
3. The value of `k` is 1, so `k` remains 1 in the expression.

Thus, the left-hand side of the assignment becomes:
- If `j` is 2: `dp[0][3][1]`
- If `j` is 3: `dp[0][4][1]`

The right-hand side is `dp[0][j][k]`, which means:
- If `j` is 2: `dp[0][2][1]`
- If `j` is 3: `dp[0][3][1]`

In both cases, the assignment means that the value of `dp[0][j][1]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.

However, since we are not given specific values in `dp`, we cannot determine the exact new values stored in `dp`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the changes in the indices and their dependencies.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2 or 3; `i` is 1; `k` is 1; and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][1]`.**
