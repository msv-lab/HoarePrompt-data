Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `dp` will be updated based on the values of `j` and `k` for all iterations, with `j` being adjusted according to the conditions specified. After all iterations, `j` will be either 1 or 2, `n`, `m`, and `s` will be at least 1, and `i` will be 0 or 1 depending on the last executed iteration.**
