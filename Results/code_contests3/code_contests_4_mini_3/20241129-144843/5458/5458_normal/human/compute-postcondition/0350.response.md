Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `dp` will have been updated based on the values of `j` and `k` during all iterations, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, and `s` is at least the maximum value of `k` executed in the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for any iteration, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 in the corresponding cases. Otherwise, the values of `dp` will reflect the updates based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` across all iterations.**
