Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 3; the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is evaluated but the values of `dp` are not specified, so we cannot determine any changes to the `dp` array.**
