The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 2; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
