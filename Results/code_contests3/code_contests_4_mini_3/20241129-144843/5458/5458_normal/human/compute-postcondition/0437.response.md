The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
