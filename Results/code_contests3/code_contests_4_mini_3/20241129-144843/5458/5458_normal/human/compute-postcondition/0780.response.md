The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
