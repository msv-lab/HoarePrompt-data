The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code within the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. As such, the values of `N`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and the expression `i + 1 & 1` remain unchanged. The assignment related to `dp` is not executed due to the continuation of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 3, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, `j + 1` is either 3 or 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
