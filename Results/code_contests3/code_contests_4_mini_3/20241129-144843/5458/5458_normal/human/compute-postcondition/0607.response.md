Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged; `j` remains unchanged; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to its previous value.**
