Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, then `dp[0][3][1]` is updated to `dp[0][2][1] % mod`, and no valid update occurs in `dp` due to invalid indexing.***
