The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `i`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 2` (value between 3 and 9); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
