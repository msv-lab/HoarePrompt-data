Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `i` is `N + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
