Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; if `j` is not greater than 2, no changes occur in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
