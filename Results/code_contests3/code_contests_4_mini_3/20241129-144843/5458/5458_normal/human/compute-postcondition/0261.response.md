The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration if there is one. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `s`, and `dp[0][3][2]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
