The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further statements within the loop. The condition for the loop remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `s` must be greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements.
