The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that we have skipped to the next iteration of the loop without any modification to the state of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `dp[1][5][2]` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][4]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][4]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
