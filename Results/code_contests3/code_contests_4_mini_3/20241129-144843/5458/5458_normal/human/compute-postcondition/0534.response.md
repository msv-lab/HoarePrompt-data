According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the current value for the loop, which is at least 1 and less than or equal to `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` will be `k + 1`. Since `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than `s`, and `k` is `k + 1`.**
