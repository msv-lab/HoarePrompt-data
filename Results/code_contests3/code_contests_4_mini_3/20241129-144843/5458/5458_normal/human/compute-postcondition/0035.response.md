The code contains a `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is within and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change during this statement, and we do not have specifics about `i`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
