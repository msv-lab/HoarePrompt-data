According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 7 and does not directly affect the loop execution, we focus on `s`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` should be at least 1, and `k` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
