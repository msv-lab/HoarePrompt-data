Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 1`; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
