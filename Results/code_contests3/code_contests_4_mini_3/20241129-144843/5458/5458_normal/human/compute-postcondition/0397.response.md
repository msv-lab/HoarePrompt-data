Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `k` is 1, and `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, then `dp[1][3][1] = 1`; if `j` is 3, then `dp[1][4][1] = 1`. If `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, then `dp[0][3][1]` is updated; if `j` is 3, then `dp[0][4][1]` is updated.***
