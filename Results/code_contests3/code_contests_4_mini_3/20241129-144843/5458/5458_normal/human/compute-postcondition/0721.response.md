The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow by skipping the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 2; the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
