Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the variables, and the condition for the loop execution remains dependent on `s` being greater than or equal to 3.***
