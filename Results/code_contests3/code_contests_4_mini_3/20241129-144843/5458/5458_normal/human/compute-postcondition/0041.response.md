According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, we can infer that `m` can range from 1 to 7. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2, allowing `j` to be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` will be 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, j will be 2.**
