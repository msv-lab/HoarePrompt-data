The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not specified, but it will now increase by the value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value, and the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is unknown.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
