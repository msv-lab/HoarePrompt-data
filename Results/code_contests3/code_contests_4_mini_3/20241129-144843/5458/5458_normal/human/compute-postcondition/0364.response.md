Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is adjusted to 2, and no changes are made to `dp` or the values of `j` and `k` if `j` is less than `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated based on the last iteration, `j` is adjusted to 2 if it was 1 or 1 if it was 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` while maintaining that `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 1.***
