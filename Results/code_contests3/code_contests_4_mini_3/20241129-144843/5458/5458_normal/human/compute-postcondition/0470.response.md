The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but alters the flow of control in the program by skipping the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
