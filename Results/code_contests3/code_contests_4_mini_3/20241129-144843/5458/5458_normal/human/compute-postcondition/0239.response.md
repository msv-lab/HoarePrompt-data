The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` involves the following calculations:

1. `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 0 (since 4 in binary is `100`, and `1` is `001`, the bitwise AND results in `000` which is 0).
2. `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2.
3. `k` is 1, which remains unchanged in this part of the assignment.

Thus, the assignment becomes:
```
dp[0][2][1] = dp[0][1][1] % mod
```

The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged; only the value at `dp[0][2][1]` is affected based on the value at `dp[0][1][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][2][1]` is set to `dp[0][1][1] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][2][1]` is set to `dp[0][1][1] % mod**.
