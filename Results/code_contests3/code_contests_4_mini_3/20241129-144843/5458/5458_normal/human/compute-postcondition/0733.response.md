The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. The value of `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` is `3`, and `k` is `1`. Therefore, the element being assigned is `dp[1][3][1]`.

The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the initial variables alongside the new assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 1; `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
