Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[0][j][k] % mod`, although the operation on `dp` is not valid due to negative indexing.***
