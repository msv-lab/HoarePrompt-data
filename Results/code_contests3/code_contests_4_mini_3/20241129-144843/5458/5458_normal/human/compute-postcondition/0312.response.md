The `while 1:` loop is an infinite loop, which means it will always execute again regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `dp` is fully updated based on the values of `j` from 1 to `M` and `k` from 1 to `S`; the output is `dp[n`**
