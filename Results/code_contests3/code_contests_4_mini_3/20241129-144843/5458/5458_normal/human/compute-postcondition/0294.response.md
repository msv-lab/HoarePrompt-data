The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that there has been no change in the variable values, but indicates that we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 3; `k` is at least 4; `s` is at least 3; `dp[0][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
