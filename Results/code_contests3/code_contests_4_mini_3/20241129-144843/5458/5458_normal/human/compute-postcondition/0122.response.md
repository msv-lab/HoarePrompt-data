Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, the expression `dp[3][3][2]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[2][2][0] % mod`, with `m` being greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2.***
