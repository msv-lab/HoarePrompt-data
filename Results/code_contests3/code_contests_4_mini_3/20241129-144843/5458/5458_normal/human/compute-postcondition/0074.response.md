According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from 1 to `m`, and for it to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

If we denote the current value of `j` as at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be at least 3. The value of `m` must be at least 3 for that condition to hold.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least `N`, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3, and `dp` is updated based on the values of `j` and `k` throughout the iterations; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 3.**
