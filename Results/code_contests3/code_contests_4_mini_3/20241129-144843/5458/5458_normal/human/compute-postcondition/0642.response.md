According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s` and the loop index `k`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value, which is `s`. 

Since `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop, the next value of `k` will be `s + 1`, which is outside the bounds of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be increased to at least `s + 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the increment of `k` and the requirement for `s` to be at least `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2.**
