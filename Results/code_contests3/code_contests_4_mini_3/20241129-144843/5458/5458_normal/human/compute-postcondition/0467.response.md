The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The variable `k` is `2`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, implying `j` is at least `2` or more. Thus, `j + 1` will be at least `3`.

The assignment will therefore be to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3`. This results in `dp[1][3][2] = 1`. The states of other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **if `i` is 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
