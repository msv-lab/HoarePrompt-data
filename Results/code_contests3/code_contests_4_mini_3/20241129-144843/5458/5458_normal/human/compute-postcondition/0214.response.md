The code assigns the value `1` to the multidimensional array `dp` at the index determined by the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

- The value of `i` is `3`, so `i + 1` is `4`. The expression `4 & 1` evaluates to `0` (since `4` in binary is `100`, and `1` is `001`, the result of AND operation is `000`, which is `0`).
- The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` is `2`.
- The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment is to `dp[0][2][1] = 1`.

The other variables `N`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the `dp` array and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `dp[0][2][1]` is 1**.
