According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`, which means the loop has reached its upper limit. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented; however, since it is already at `m + 1`, it cannot execute again. 

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be incremented, and `j` should reset to `1`, which would allow the loop to start over. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is `N + 2`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is `s`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `m` must be increased to at least 1.**
