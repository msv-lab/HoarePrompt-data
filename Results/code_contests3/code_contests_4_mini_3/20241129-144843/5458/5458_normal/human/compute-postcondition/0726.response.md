Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and for all `k` from `1` to `s`, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1 for those specific values of `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for all valid `k`.**
