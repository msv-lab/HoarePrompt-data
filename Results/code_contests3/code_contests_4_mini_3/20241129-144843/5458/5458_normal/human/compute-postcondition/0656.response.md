Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `m` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
