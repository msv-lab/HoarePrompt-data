The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated first, taking the value of `i`, which is `0`. Thus, `i + 1` is `1` and `1 & 1` results in `1`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is `1`), so `j + 1` is at least `2`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the assignment has been made to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and dp[1][j + 1][1] is set to 1.**
