According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 5 and `s` is at least 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 6. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 6.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 6, `s` is at least 6**
