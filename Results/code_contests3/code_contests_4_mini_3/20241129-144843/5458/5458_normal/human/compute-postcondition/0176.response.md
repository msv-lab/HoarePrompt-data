According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `s`, which means it will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. 

The current state indicates that `i` is 2 and `j` is 4, but these variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 4, which allows for the fourth iteration (when `k` is 4). 

Given that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, and `k` is `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a fourth time. Since `k` is assigned to `s`, we can assume `s` needs to be 4 or more. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the fourth time:
- The value of `s` must be at least 4.
- The value of `k` must be 4 during the fourth iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, for the loop to execute the fourth time `m` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
