Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[1][5][4]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][4][4]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any action.***
