Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `s` must be at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[0][3][1]` is now equal to `dp[0][2][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
