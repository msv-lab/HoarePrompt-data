According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
