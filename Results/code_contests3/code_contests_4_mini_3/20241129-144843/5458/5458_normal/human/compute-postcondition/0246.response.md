Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1)***
