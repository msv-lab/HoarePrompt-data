Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to `dp[1][2][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the values of `dp`.***
