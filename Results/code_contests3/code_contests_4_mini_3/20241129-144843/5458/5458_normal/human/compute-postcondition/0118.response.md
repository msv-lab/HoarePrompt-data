The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the context does not provide information on any loop structure, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2] = dp[1][2][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
