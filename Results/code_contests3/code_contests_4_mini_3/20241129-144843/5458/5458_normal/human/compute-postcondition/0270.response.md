The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop of which we were a part. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to `dp[1][2][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
