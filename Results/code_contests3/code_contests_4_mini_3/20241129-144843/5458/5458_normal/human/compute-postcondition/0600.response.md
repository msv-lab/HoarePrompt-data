According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being `s + 1`, which is out of the loop’s range. 

To summarize:
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `j` and `i` are not affected directly by this loop.
- The loop cannot execute again because the condition `k` being less than or equal to `s` will not be satisfied (as it will be `s + 1`).

Thus, the state can be represented as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
