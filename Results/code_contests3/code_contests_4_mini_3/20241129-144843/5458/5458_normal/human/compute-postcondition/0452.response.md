According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `m`, which means it can execute while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means `j` will become 3.

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, and `m` must also be sufficiently large to allow `j` to be 3, we can infer that `m` must be at least 3 to execute the loop again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, and for the loop to execute a third time, `m` must be at least 3.**
