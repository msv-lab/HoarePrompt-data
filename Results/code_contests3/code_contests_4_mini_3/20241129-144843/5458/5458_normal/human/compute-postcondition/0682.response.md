Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
