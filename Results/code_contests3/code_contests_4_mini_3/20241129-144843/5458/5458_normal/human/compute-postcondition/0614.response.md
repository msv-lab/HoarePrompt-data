Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 1; `i`, `j` remain unchanged; `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute again. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
