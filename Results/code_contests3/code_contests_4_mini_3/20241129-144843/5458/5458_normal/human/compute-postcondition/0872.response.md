The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N + 2`; `s` is at least 1; `k` is `s`; `j` is `m + 1`; for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be at least `j`; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
