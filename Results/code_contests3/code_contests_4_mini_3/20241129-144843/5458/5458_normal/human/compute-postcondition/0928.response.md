Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is `N + 2`; `j` is `s` or greater; `dp` is updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` potentially being set to 1 or modified based on previous values in the `dp` array.**
