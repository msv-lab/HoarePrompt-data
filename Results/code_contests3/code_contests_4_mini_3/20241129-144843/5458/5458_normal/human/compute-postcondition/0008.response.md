According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. In order for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. Given that `i` is already set to 0 before the loop starts, this will not affect the execution as `i` is not used in the loop condition. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
