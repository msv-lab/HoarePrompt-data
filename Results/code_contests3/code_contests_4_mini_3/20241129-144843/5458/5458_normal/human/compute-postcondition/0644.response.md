Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
