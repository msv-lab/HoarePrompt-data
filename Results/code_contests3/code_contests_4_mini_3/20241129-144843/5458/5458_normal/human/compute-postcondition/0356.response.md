Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `j` is adjusted to 2, and `k` is some value satisfying the conditions. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp` or the values of `j` and `k`.***
