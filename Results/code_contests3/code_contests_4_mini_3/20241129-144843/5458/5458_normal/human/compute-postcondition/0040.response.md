Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` will be 1; `dp` will be updated based on the values of `j` and `k` during all iterations; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` for any value of `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on previous values in the `dp` array and the modulus operation.**
