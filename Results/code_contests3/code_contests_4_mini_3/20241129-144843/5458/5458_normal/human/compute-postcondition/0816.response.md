Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `dp` array at index `[1][5][2]` has been updated to 1; current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
