The code affects the array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial values, we have `i` is 0, `j` is 4, and `k` is 3. 

First, we calculate the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `4 + 1`, which is `5`.

Now, we assign the value `1` to `dp[1][5][3]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged as this operation only modifies the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][5][3]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][5][3]` is assigned the value 1.**
