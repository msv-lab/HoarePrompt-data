According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
