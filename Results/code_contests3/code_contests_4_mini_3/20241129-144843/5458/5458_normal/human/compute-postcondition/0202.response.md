The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `k` is 6, `s` is at least 6, and `dp[1][5][6]` is now equal to `dp[1][4][6]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
