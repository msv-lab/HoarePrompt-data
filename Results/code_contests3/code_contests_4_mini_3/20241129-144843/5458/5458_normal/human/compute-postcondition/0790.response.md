Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the assignment `dp[1][4][3]` is not executed. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the relevant variables.***
