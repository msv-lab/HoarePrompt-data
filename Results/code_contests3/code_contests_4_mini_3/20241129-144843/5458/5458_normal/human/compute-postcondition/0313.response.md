`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which is a space-separated string processed by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The current state of `N`, `i`, and `dp` is unaffected by this input assignment, but now we have values for `n`, `m`, and `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments and retains the previous values of other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `dp` is fully updated based on the values of `j` from 1 to `M` and `k` from 1 to `S`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input.**
