Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
