The function processes multiple datasets of three positive integers N, M, and S, where N is constrained between 1 and 7, M between 1 and 2000, and S between 1 and 3000. It calculates a specific value based on dynamic programming principles for each dataset, printing the result for each dataset until it encounters the terminating input of 0 0 0. The function handles the input directly and does not return a value in the traditional sense but instead prints results directly to the output.
