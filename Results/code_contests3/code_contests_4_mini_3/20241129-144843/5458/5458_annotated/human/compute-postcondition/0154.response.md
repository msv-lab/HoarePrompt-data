Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least `j + 1`, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0; if `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, otherwise no changes occur. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
