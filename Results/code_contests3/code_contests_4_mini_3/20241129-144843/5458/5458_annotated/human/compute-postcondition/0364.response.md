Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
