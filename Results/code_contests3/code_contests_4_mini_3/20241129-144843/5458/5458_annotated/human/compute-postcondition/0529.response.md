The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state reflects that we have moved to the next iteration of the loop while maintaining all existing values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `dp` array is fully updated; `i` is at least 1 and not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
