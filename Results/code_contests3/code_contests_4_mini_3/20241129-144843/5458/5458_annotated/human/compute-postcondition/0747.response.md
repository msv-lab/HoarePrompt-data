The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration if there is one. Since the output state is to reflect the current variable states without any modifications, we retain the previous values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or `x + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
