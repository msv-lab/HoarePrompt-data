The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional array `dp`. The index `i + 1 & 1` refers to a bitwise operation which will yield either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is even or odd, since `& 1` will mask all but the least significant bit.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1 for the destination index, while the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged in this operation. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is essentially copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `dp` at those indices, we cannot detail the exact changes but we can describe the outcome based on the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
