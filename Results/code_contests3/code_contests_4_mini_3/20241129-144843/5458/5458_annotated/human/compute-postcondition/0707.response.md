Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 1; `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is positive, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
