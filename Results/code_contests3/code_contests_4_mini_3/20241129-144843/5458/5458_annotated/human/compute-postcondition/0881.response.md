The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop or statement we are currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 2; `dp` has been fully modified; `j` is at least 1; `k` is 2; and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop or statement.
