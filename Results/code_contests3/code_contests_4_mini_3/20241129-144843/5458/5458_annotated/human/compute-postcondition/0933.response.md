The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without parameters. It processes multiple datasets consisting of three positive integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`, which must meet the following constraints: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The input ends with a dataset of `0 0 0`, which signifies the termination of input. 

The function returns values based on the conditions defined for the valid datasets of `N`, `M`, and `S`, but the specific output for each case is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process multiple datasets of integers within the given constraints until the termination signal is encountered.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7, M is between 1 and 2000, and S is between 1 and 3000, terminating on the input of 0 0 0.**
