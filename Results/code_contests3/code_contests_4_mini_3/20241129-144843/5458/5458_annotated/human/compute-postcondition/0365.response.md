According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again for `k = 2`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
