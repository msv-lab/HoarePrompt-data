Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is equal to `s`. The `dp` array is updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` throughout the iterations, resulting in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated based on previous values of `dp` if `i` is greater than 0.**
