Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is the maximum value reached during iterations; `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
