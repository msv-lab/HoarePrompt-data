According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, which means the loop has executed three times already. To execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is at least 4; `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described; and `k` is 4 for the fourth execution.**
