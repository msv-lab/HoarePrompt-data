The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is equal to `initial_value + s + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, `initial_value + s + 1 ≤ m`, `i` is not equal to 0; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
