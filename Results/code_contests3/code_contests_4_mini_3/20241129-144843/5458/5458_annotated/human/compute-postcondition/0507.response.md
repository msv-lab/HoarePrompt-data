Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `s` is at least 2, `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` when `j` is not greater than `k`.***
