Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least 1; `j` is either 1 or greater; `k` is 3; and `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the condition holds and the program continues to execute; otherwise, there is no else part to execute.***
