Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; `k` is equal to `s`; if `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is set based on the conditions; if `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated based on the values in the `dp` array, possibly reflecting the sums of previous states involving modulo operations.**
