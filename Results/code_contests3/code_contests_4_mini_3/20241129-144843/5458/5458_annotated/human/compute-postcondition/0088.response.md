According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1, making `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must also be at least 2, since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
