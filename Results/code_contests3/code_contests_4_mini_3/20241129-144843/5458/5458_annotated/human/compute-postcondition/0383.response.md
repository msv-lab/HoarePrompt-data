Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1 for all valid `j`. For `i` greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` for valid ranges of `j` and `k`.**
