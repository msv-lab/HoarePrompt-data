Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is an integer where `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not modify `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
