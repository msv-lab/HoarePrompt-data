According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition for the range of `j`. The loop is set to iterate over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `s + 1`, which means it has already exceeded the minimum value of `1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be at least `m + 1` for the loop to stop executing. Therefore, if the loop executes again, `j` would be updated to `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1; `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute a next time `m` must be at least `s + 1`.**
