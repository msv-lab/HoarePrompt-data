The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code within the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement; it only affects the flow control of the loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
