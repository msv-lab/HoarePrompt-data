According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to the current value of `j` in the loop, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` starts at 1, after the last iteration, if the loop has executed for the value of `j`, it would be `m` or less. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, the value of `j` must be less than `m`, which means it must be incremented to `j + 1`.

Given that `m` is at least 1, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, thus to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is equal to `s`; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m - 1`, and `j` is now `j + 1`**
