Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
