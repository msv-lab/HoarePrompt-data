According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value in the range of the loop. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, the loop will execute again for the next value of `j`, which will be `j + 1`. 

Given that `j` is currently `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `m + 1`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is an integer where `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be at least `m + 1`, and `j` is `m + 1`.**
