The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] while continuing to the next iteration of the loop.
