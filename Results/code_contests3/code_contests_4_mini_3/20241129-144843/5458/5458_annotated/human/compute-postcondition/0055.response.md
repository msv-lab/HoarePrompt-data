According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, the condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied as long as `s` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `s` must be at least 2.**
