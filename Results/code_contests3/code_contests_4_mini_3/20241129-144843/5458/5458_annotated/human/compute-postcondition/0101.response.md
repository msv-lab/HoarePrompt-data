The code `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 3; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
