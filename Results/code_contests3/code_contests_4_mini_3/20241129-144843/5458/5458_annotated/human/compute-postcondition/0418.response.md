According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the number of iterations executed so far. Since `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, and thus `n ** 2` is at least 1 and can be at most 49 (when `N` is 7).

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, and after the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

If `i` was previously `n ** 2 - 1`, it would mean the loop executed `n ** 2` times, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be `n ** 2`. 

Therefore, if `i` is currently `n ** 2 - 1`, it will become `n ** 2`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is still valid.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is `n ** 2`, `k` is `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
