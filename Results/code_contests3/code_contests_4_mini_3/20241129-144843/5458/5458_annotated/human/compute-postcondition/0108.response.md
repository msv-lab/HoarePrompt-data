According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n ** 2`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `n` is at least 1, we need to determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, and `i` can be 0 or greater than 0, we can conclude that `n ** 2` will be at least 1 (when `n` is 1). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have reached a value that is less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

If we assume that the increment of `i` is applied, the new state will be:
- If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
- If `i` was at some value less than `n ** 2`, it will become that value plus 1.

The condition for the loop to execute again is `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, if `m` is at least the maximum value of the loop and `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`, those states remain unchanged.

Thus, the next state will be:
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n ** 2`, `m` is at least the maximum value of the loop, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`**
