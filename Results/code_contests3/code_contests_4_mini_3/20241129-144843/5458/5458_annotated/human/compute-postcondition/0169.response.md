The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
