The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` is not set due to the condition not being met, hence the values of the affected variables remain unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
