The code snippet `continue` does not modify any variables, but it is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this context, it implies that the loop will continue executing without completing the remaining statements of the current iteration.

Since the initial state specifies that `s` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, these conditions suggest that the loop will execute at least once. However, the values of `N`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged because the `continue` statement does not affect them.

Therefore, the Output State reflects that the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is now 1, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
