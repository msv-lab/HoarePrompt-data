The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
