Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or `x + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, `s` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
