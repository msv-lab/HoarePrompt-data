Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 2; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the operation attempts to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but may access an invalid index due to `k - j` being negative.***
