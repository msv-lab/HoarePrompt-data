Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, while `m` is at least `j + 1`, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is not 0, then `N` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j` is greater than 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
