The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop should be skipped, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
