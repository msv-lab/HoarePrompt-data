Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described in the loop, and `k` is 2 during the second execution. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1.***
