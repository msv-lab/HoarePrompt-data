According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is currently 2, and `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. Since `k` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2, but for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since the loop will go up to `s + 1` which will be at least 4). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 3.**
