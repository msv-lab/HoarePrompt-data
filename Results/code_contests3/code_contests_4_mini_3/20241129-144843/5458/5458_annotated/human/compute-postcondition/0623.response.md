The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` were at least 1, but they will now change to the values provided by the user input. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code, but they depend on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s` respectively.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `m`, `s` are now updated based on user input; `i` is `n^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `m`, `s` are now updated based on user input; `i` is `n^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s`.**
