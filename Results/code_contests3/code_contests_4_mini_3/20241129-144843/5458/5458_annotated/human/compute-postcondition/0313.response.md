The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input provided to `raw_input()`, which is split into components and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not directly altered by this line of code; instead, `n`, `m`, and `s` will hold the integer values that are read from the input. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned input integer values.**
