According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `k` will take on values starting from 1 up to `s`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `k` was incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be equal to `s + 1` (the end of the range). Hence, `k` would next be 2, and `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is at least 1, there are no changes to `dp`, and the loop will execute again for `k` equal to 2, and `s` must be at least 2.**
