The statement `continue` does not change any variable values or states; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is either 1 or greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
