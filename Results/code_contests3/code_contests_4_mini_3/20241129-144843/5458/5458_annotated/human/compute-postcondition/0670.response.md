The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as we continue in the loop.
