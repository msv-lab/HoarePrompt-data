The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the current iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the output state remains unaffected in terms of the variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
