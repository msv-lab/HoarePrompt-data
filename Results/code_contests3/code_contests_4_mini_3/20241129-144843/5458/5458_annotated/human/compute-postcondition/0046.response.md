Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.***
