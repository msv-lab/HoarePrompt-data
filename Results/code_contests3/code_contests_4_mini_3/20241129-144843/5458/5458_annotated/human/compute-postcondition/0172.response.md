The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state. 

Since we know that `k` is at least `j + 1`, this means `k - j` is at least 1. Therefore, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` can be accessed, but without specific values for `dp`, we cannot determine the exact output state for that variable.

Thus, the output state reflects the operation performed without specifying the resulting values of the `dp` variables:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
