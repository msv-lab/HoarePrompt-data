Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
