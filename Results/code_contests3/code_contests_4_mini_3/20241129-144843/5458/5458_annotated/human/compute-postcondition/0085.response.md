Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
