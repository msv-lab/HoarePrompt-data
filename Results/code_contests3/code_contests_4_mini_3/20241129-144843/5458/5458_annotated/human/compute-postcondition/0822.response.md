The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remainder of the loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is at least 4; `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described; `k` is 4 for the fourth execution; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
