Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 2; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no modifications to `dp` occur. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` remains unchanged.***
