According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The given state indicates that `i` is 0, which is appropriate for the first iteration of the loop, and `N` and `n` do not directly affect the execution of the loop in this context.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the necessary condition is that `m` must be at least 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
