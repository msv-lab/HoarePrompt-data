Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least 1; `j` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is at least `s`; `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, containing the results of the computations as dictated by the loop logic.**
