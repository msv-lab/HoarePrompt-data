Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `m`, and `s` are non-negative integers where `n` and `m` are at least 0; `s` is at least 0; `dp` has been fully computed based on the defined conditions throughout the loop iterations; the output is `dp[N**2 & 1][M + 1][S] % mod`.**
