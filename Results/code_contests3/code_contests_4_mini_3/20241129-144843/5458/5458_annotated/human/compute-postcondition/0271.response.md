Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement without changing the variable values.***
