The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable assignments.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is `s + 1` where `s` is at least 1; `k` is 2; `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
