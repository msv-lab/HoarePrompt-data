In this case, the `while` loop is structured as `while 1`, which is an infinite loop and will always execute at least once. Therefore, no modifications are needed to allow the loop to execute for the first time, as it will inherently do so.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000**
