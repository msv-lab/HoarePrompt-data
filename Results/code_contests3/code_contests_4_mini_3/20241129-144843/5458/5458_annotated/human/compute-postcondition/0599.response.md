Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 1; `s` is at least 1; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the operation modifies `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` based on an invalid index calculation for `k - j`.***
