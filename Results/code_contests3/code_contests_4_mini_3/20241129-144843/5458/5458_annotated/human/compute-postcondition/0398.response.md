According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will run as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` would increase by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0.**
