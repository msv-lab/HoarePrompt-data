The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` affect the indices used in this assignment. The variable `k` is fixed at 2, and `j` can be at least 1. The variable `i` is a non-negative integer, and since the code references `i + 1 & 1`, it will result in either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i` (0 for even, 1 for odd). 

The output state will reflect that the assignment takes place but does not provide explicit values for the array `dp` or detail its previous values. Therefore, we summarize that the operation affects the `dp` array based on the current indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1, and `i` is a non-negative integer.**
