The value of `mod` is assigned the constant value of `100000`. This assignment does not change the values of `N`, `M`, or `S`, as they remain as positive integers within their specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the assignment of `mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000**.
