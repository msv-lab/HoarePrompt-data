According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. For the loop to continue executing, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
