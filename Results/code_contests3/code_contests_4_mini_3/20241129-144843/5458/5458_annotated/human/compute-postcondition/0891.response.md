Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
