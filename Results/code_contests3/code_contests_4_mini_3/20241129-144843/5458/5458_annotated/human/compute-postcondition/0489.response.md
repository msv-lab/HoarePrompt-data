Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is equal to `initial_value + s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which implies `initial_value + s + 1 ≥ s`, `i` is equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
