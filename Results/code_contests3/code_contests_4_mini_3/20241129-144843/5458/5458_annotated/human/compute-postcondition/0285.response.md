The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `s + 1` where `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
