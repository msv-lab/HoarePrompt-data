Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, `dp` reflects the final updates based on conditions, `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the operation may lead to an invalid index.***
