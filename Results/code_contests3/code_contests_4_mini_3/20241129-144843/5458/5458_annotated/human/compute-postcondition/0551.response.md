Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s - 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, when `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
