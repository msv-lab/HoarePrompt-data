According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and `m` is at least 1. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, if `j` is currently `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to `k + 1`. 

Given that `j` is at least 1, we can summarize the conditions as follows: if `j` is currently `k`, then it will become `k + 1` for the next iteration, and `m` needs to be at least `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is equal to `s`; `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `j` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
