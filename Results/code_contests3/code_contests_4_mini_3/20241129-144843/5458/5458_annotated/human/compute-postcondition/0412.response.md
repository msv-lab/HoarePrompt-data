Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes to the program state occur.***
