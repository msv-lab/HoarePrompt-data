Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is at least 4; if `i` is 0, then `dp` is modified with value 1 at the position dependent on `i` and `j` if `j` is greater than or equal to 4, otherwise there is no modification to `dp`. If `i` is 1 (the else case), then `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions; `k` is 4 for the fourth execution.***
