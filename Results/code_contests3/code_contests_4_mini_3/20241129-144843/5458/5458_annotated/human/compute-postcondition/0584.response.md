Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`.***
