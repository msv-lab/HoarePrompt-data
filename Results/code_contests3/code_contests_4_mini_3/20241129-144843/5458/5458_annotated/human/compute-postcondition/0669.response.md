Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer (i.e., `i` is greater than 0), `m` is at least `j + 1`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `j` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, but no specific values have changed.**
