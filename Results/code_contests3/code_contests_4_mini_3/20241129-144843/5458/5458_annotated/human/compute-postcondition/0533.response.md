Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is iterating until it reaches `s`; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is at least 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
