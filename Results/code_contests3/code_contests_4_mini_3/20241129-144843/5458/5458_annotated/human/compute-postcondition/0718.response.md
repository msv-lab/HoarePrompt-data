The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates the least significant bit of `i + 1` (where `&` is a bitwise AND operation). 

Given that `i` is a non-negative integer, `i + 1` will be at least `1`. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd:
- If `i` is even, `i + 1` is odd, and `i + 1 & 1` is `1`.
- If `i` is odd, `i + 1` is even, and `i + 1 & 1` is `0`.

The variable `j` is at least `1`, so `j + 1` will be at least `2`. The variable `k` is `2`, which is explicitly stated.

Thus, the index being accessed in the `dp` array is dependent on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is even, the assignment will be to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`.
- If `i` is odd, the assignment will be to `dp[0][j + 1][2]`.

However, since we don't have specific values for `i`, we cannot conclusively determine which index is being modified. Regardless, the value `1` will be assigned to one of the indices based on the parity of `i`.

The states of `N`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged, and only the `dp` array is modified.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.**
