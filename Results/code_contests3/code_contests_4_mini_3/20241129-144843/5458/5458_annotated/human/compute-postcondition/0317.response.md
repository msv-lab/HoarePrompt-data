According to the code, the loop is dependent on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n ** 2` is at least 1, which means `n` must be at least 1 because `n` is a positive integer. Given that `N` is between 1 and 7, it guarantees that `n` will also be a positive integer. 

Before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration. Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` is set to 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
