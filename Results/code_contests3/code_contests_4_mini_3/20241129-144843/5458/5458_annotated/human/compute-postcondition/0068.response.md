The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2 or greater than or equal to `s`; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
