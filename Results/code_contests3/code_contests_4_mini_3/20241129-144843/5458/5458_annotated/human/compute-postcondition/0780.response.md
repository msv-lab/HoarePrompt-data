The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
