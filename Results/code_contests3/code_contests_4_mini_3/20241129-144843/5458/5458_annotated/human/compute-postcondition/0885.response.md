Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
