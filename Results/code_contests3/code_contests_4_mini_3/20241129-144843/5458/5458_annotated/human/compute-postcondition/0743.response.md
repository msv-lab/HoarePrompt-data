According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 1 (the starting point of the loop) and must be increased by 1 for the next iteration. Given that `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or `x + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2**
