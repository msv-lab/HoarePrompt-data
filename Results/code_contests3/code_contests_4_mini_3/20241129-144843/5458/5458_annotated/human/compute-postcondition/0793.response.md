Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices dependent on `i` and `j`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
