According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again if `s` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
