According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 (as given). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, after the last iteration where `k` is 2, the next value of `k` would be 3.

Additionally, `s` is at least 1, meaning that `s` can be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time since it has to be greater than or equal to `k` (which is now 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
