The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 1 for the first execution, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
