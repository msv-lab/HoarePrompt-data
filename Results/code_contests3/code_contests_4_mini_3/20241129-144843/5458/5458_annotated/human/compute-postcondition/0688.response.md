The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
