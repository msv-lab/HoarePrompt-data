The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the output state does not change due to the `continue`, we maintain the original values of all variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least 1; `j` is either 1 or greater; `k` is 3; and `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time.
