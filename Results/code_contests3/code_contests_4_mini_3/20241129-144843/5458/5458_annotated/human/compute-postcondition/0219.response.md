The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified and we are just moving to the next iteration without changing anything, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` reflects the final updates based on conditions, `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues.**
