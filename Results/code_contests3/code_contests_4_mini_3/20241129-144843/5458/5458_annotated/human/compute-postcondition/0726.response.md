Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is `s`; `s` is at least 1. The `dp` array has been updated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, with specific assignments depending on the conditions involving `i` and `j`.**
