Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a non-negative integer, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `j` is 1 or greater, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped. Otherwise, the nearest enclosing loop continues without any change to `dp`.***
