Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is `n^2 - 1`; `m` is at least 1; `s` is the maximum value reached during iterations; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s`; `dp` has been fully modified based on the conditions described in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
