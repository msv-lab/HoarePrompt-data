The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
