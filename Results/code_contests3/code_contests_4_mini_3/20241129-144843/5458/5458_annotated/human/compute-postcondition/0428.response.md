The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous assigned value, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
