According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied in the provided state. 

The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `m`. Given that `j` is initially set to `m + 1`, it indicates that the loop has already completed its first iteration and is now set to execute a second time. However, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Thus for the loop to execute a second time, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `j` is equal to 2 (the next value that `j` would take if the loop allows for another iteration). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp` array is fully updated, `i` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n`**
