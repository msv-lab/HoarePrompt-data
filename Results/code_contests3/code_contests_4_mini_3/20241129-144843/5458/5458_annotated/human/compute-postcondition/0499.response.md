According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is incremented by 1, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the last value it took in the loop, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`. 

Given that `s` is at least 1 and `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is incremented to `k + 1`.**
