Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 3; `dp` has been fully modified; `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][3]` is updated based on `dp[0][3][0] % mod`.***
