According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, making `k` equal to 2. Additionally, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is either 1 or greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.**
