Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it can always execute again regardless of the states of `N`, `M`, `S`, or `dp`. There are no adjustments needed for the loop to proceed to its next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; the value of `dp` at index `[N`**
