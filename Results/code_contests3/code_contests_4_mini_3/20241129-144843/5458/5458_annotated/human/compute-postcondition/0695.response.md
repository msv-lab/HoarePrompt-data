According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. The loop is designed to execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. 

1. Before the loop starts, `k` must be initialized to 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
2. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `s` is at least 1, as the loop runs for `k` values from 1 to `s`. If `s` is less than 1, the loop cannot execute.
3. Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, which implies the state of `j` must be adjusted accordingly.

Given these considerations, the necessary states for the loop to execute the first time are:
- `k` is initialized to 1.
- `s` must be at least 1.
- `j` can be at least 1 or greater but will be incremented for the second execution.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a non-negative integer, `m` is at least `j + 2`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the current value and will be incremented to `j + 1` for the second execution.**
