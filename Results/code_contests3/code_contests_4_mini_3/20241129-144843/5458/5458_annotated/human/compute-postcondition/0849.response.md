Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is now 3, `k` is 2, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
