Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is either 1 or greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop may not execute a second time as `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.***
