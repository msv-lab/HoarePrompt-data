Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is at least 4; `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described; `k` is 4 for the fourth execution. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
