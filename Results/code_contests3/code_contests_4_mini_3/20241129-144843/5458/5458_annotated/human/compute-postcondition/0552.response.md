Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1` after the last iteration; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` reflects the updates made during the loop based on the conditions and previous states of the `dp` array.**
