Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `dp` has been modified such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] = 1`, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp` is modified accordingly.***
