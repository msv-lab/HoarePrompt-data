Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
