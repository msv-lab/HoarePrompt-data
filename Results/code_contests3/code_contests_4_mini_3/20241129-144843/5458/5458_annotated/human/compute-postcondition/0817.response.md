Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than or equal to 3; `s` is at least 2; `dp` has been modified based on the conditions described; and `k` is 3 for the third execution. If `i` is 0, then `dp` is modified such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] = 1` and `dp` is updated accordingly based on the value of `j`. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
