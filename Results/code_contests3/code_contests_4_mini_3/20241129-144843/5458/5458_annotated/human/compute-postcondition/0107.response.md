Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least the maximum value of the loop, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s`. The `dp` array will be fully updated based on the conditions of the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` reflecting the accumulated results derived from the iterations governed by the logic within the nested loops.**
