Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
