Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1, and we continue to the next iteration or statement. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes to `dp`, and the loop will execute again for `k` equal to 2, with `s` being at least 2.***
