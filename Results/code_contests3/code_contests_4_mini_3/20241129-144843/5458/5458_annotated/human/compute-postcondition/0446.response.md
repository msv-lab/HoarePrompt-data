The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 3; assignment to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was made from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
