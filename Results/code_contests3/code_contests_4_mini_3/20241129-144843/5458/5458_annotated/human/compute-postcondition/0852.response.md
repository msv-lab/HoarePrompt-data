Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 2; `dp` has been fully modified; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `i` is 0, `j` is now 3 and `k` is 2, leading to an invalid access to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` due to a negative index.***
