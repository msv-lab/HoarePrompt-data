The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
