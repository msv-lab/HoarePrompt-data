Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a non-negative integer, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
