Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop, resulting in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being set to either 1 or updated according to the previous values depending on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` at the end of all iterations.**
