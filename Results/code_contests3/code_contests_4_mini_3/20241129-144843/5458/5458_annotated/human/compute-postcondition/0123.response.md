According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. In the provided state, `k` is currently 1, which means the loop has executed once for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be incremented by 1 to 2. 

Since it's stated that `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 (to allow `k` to take the value of 2). 

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
