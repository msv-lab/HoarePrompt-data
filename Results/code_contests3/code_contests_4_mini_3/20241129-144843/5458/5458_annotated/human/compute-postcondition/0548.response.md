Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
