The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement results in skipping the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that we have continued to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 2; `j` is now `j + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
