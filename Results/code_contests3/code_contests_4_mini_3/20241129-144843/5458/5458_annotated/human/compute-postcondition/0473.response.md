The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given, with `k` being 2 and `j` being incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` is 2, and since `j` is now `j + 1`, we use `j + 1` in the calculation.

The value of `k - j` will be `2 - (j + 1)` which simplifies to `1 - j`. This means we need to check the value of `dp[i & 1][j][1 - j] % mod`.

Therefore, the previous values of the variables are affected as follows:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][1 - j] % mod`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 2; `j` is now `j + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][1 - j] % mod` to it.**
