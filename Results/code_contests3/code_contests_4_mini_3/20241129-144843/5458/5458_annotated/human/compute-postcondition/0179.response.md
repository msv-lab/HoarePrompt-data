Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
