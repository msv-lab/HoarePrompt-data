Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, `m` are at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, and `i` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous assigned value, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
