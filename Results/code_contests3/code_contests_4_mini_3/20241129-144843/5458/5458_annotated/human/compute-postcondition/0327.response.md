The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables `N`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `k`, or `j`, and the values remain as they were before the execution of the `continue` statement, the output state reflects that the values of the variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
