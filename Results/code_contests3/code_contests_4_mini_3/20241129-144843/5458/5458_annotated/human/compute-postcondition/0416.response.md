Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 1; `k` is `s + 1`; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, resulting in values assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]` and possibly `dp[0][j][k - j]` depending on the relationships among these variables.**
