Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 (and must still be less than or equal to `s`), and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
