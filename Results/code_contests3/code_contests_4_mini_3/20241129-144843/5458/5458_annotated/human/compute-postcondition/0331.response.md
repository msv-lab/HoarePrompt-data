Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is an integer where `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
