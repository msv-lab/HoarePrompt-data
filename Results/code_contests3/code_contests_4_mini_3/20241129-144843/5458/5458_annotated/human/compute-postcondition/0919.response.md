According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2 (since `s` is at least 2). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.**
