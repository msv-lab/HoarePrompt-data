The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` indicates that the value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Given that `i` is a non-negative integer starting at 0, `i + 1` will be either 1 (when `i = 0`) or greater. The bitwise AND operation with 1 will yield 0 if `i` is 0 (since 1 & 1 = 1) or 1 if `i` is greater than 0.

The variable `j` is at least 1 or greater, and `k` is at least 1. Therefore, `j + 1` will also be at least 2.

The specific values of `dp` prior to this operation are not provided, but it is updated according to the specified condition. The output state reflects that `dp` has been updated at the specified indices.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
