According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from `1` to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Given that `j` is greater than or equal to `2`, we must also ensure that `k` can be incremented without exceeding `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is currently at its maximum valid value (which is less than or equal to `s`). To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented by `1`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must now be less than or equal to `s`. 

Since `k` is incremented, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must now be within the range of `1` to `s`, which means `k` is now `k + 1`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s - 1` (so that `k + 1` can be less than or equal to `s`).**
