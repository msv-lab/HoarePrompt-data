The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s` (at least 1) and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
