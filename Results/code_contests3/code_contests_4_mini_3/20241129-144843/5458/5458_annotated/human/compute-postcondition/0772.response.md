Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.***
