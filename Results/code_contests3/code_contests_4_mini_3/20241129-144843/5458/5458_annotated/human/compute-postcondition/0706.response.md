Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a positive integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 1; `s` is at least 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
