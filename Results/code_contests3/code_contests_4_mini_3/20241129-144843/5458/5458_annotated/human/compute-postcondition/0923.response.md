The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been modified at indices `[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` based on the value at indices `[i + 1 & 1][2][3]`, `j` is 2, `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
