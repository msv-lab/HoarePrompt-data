Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a non-negative integer and equals 0, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `j` for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.***
