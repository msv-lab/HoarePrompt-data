Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, the state remains unchanged due to an invalid index `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` when `j` is 3 and `k` is 2.***
