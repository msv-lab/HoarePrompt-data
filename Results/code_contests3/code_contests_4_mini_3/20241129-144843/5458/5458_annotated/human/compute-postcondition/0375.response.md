The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` indicates that we are modifying a specific element in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `k` is 3. The operation involves incrementing `i` and `j` by 1, and the expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, the values of `i` and `j` could also be influenced by `N`, but the exact values of `i` and `j` are not provided. However, we know that `k` remains constant at 3. The output state will reflect that the specific element in `dp` has been set to 1, but we cannot determine the exact indices without knowing `i` and `j`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that the specified element in `dp` is updated.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1**
