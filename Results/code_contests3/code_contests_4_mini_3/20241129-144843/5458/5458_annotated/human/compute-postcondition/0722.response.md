Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any further actions related to this if statement.***
