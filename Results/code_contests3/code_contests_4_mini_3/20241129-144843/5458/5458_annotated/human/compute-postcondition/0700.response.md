Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `j + 2`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is the current value and will be incremented to `j + 1` for the second execution.***
