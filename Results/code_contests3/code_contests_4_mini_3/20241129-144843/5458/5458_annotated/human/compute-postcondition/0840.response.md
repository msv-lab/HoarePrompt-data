Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 1 for the first execution, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
