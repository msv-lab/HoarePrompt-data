According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. The loop variable `k` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration until it exceeds `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `2`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `3`. 

Given that `s` is at least `1`, and since `k` is currently `2`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least `3` (so that `k` can reach `3` without exceeding `s`). 

Thus, the state needs to be updated to reflect this increment of `k`, while keeping in mind that `s` must allow for this increment.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3**
