The code `continue` indicates that the program will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 3; `j` is now `j + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
