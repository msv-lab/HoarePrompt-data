To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the structure of the for loop.

1. The loop `for i in xrange(n ** 2):` depends on the value of `n`. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, we can infer that `n` will also be positive if it is derived from `N`. 

2. The loop will execute a number of times equal to `n ** 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1 (which it is, given the constraints).

3. The initial value of `i` starts at 0 and will increment until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`. Therefore, `i` will begin at 0 at the start of the loop.

4. The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are updated based on user input; however, there is no specification on the conditions under which the loop may break. The only relevant detail is that the loop will not execute if `n` is 0, which is not the case here.

5. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that `N` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` will also be at least 1.

Based on this analysis, the loop can execute, starting with `i` initialized to 0. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
