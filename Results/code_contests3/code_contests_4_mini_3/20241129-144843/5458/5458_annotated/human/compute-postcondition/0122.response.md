Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and an operation is attempted that could lead to an invalid index access due to `k - j < 0`.***
