According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least `j + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
