Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is greater than 0; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
