Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `j` is 1 or greater; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
