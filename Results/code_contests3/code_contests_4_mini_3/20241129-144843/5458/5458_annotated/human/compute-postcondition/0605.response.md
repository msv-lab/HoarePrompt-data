Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; if `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` remains unchanged, and the values of all affected variables remain the same, continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
