Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and `dp` reflects the final updates based on the conditions while continuing to the next iteration of the loop if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`.***
