Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is 2; `j` is now `j + 1`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][1 - j] % mod` to it.***
