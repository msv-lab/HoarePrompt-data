According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once if the initial conditions are met. However, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than or equal to `m`.

From the provided state, we know:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7.
- `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1.
- `k` is equal to `s`.
- `j` is equal to `initial_value + s + 1`.

To ensure that the loop executes one more time, we need to check the condition:
- `j ≤ m`.

Currently, `j` is defined as `initial_value + s + 1`. If we want to make sure that the loop can execute one more time, we can adjust the value of `j` or ensure that `m` is sufficiently large. 

Thus, we need to ensure:
- `initial_value + s + 1 ≤ m` 

For this to hold true, we might adjust `m` or potentially `initial_value` if necessary.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is equal to `initial_value + s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j ≤ m` must hold true, which implies `initial_value + s + 1 ≤ m`.**
