Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, and `s` are updated based on user input, `i` is `n^2`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `s`; `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) filled with zeros.**
