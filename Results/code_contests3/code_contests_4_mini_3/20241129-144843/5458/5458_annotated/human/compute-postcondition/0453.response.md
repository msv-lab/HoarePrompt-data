According to the code, the loop runs a specific number of times determined by the variable `s`, which is at least 1. For the loop to execute successfully, we need to ensure that `k` starts at 1 and can go up to `s`. 

At the start of the loop, `k` is equal to `s`, which means that this is the last iteration of the loop. In order for the loop to execute a second time, we need to adjust `k` to be 1 (the first iteration), and `s` should remain unchanged to allow the loop to be executed correctly. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `k` is now 1, and `s` remains as it was (since it is still at least 1).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is now 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `j` is now `j + 1`**
