According to the provided code, the loop executes based on the variable `k` which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have been `1` and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Given that `s` is at least `1`, `k` can take values from `1` to `s`. 

If `k` is incremented to `2`, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least `2`. 

Therefore, the adjusted state must reflect that `k` is now `2`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is an integer where `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
