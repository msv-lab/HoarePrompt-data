Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned input integer values; `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions (2, `m + 2`) and each element is a list of zeros with length (`s + 1`).**
