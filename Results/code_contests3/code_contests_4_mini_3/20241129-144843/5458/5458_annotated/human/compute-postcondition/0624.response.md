The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `m`, `s` are now updated based on user input; `i` is `n^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
