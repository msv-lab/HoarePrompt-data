The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves an index calculation based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in 1.
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
- `k` is 2, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the array index being set is `dp[1][3][2]`, and it is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change as this operation only modifies the array `dp`.

Therefore, the output state includes the new assignment in the context of the existing variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
