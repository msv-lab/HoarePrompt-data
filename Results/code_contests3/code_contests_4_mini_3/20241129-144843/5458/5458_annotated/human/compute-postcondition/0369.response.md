The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining statements in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
