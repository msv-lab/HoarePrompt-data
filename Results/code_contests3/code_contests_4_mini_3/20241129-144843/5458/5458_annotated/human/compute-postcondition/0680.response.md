Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
