Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` reflects the final updates based on the conditions while continuing to the next iteration of the loop if `j` is greater than `k`. The state of `dp` is updated if `j` > `k`, otherwise, there are no changes made to `dp`.**
