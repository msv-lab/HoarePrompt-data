According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates from `1` to `m`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `1` and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Given that `m` is at least `2`, and `j` is at least `1`, we can determine the next value for `j` which will be `2`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to `2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least the original value, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 2, and `k` is equal to `s`.**
