Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, which may involve an invalid access due to `k - j` being negative.***
