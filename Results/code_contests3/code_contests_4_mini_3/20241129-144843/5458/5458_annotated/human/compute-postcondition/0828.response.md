Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is the maximum value reached during iterations, and `dp` has been fully modified based on the conditions described in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
