Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
