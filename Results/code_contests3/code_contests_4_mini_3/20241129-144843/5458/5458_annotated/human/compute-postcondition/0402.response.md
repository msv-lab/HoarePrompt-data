The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no other statements to execute after the `continue`, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is either equal to or greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration.**
