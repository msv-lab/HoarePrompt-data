The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the multi-dimensional array `dp`, specifically at the index determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The initial values indicate that `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `1`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1` which results in `1`. The value of `j + 1` is `2 + 1`, which equals `3`. Thus, the indices for the `dp` array will be `[1][3][1]`.

The values of other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged and unaffected by this assignment. The output state reflects the updated index assignment in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
