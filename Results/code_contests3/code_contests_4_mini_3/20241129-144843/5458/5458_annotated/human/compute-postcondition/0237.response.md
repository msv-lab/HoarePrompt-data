The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `N`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
