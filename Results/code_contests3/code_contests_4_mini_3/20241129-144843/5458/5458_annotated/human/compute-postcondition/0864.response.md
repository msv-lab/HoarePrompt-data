According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. Given that `s` is defined as the maximum value reached during iterations, it should be ensured that `s` is greater than or equal to `1`. The variable `k` is initialized to `s` before the loop starts. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least `1`, and it will start with `k` equal to `1` on the first iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
