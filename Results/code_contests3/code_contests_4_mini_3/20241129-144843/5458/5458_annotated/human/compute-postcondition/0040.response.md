Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is either 1 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least the maximum value of the loop, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` will be updated based on previous `dp` values, using the relationship defined in the loop.**
