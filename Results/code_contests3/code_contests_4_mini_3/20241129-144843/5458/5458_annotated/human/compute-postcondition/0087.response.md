Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, although accessing out of bounds may occur.***
