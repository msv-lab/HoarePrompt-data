The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the specific element of a 3D list (or array) `dp`. The indices for this assignment are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. `i + 1 & 1`: The operation `&` is a bitwise AND. Since `i` is an integer and `1` is a constant, `i + 1` will either be `0` or `1` if `i` is `-1` or `0` respectively, but since `N` is a positive integer between `1` and `7`, `i` will be within a certain range, which will affect the calculation. Here, the expression evaluates to either `0` or `1`.

2. `j + 1`: This simply increments `j` by `1`.

3. `k`: The value of `k` remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect that the specific element of `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been set to `1`. The exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot specify them directly in the output state.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
