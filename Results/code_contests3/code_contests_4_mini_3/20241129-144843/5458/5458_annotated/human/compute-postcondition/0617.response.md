Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 or the attempt to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was unsuccessful due to an out-of-bounds access, the state remains unchanged regarding the attempted update.***
