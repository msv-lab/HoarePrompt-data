Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is now 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `dp` is modified at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` with the value from `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`.***
