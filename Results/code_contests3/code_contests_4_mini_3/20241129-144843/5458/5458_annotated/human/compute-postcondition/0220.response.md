Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` reflects the final updates based on conditions, `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues.***
