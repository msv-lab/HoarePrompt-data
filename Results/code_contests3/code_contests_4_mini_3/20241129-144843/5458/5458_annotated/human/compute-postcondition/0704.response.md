Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `j + 2`, `j` is at least 1 or greater, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement. Otherwise, there is no else part, and the state remains unchanged.***
