Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, and if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is at least 1, then `dp` remains unchanged, and the loop will execute again for `k` equal to 2, with the condition that `s` must be at least 2.***
