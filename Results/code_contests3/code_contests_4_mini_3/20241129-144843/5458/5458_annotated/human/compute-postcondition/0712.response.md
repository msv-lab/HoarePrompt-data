The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `i` is a non-negative integer; `m` is at least `j + 2`; `j` is at least 1 or greater; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
