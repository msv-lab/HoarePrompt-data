The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the block we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `j` is at least `s + 1`; `m` is at least `j + 1`; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue with the next iteration or statement.
