Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is greater than 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 during the second execution. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration starts; otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
