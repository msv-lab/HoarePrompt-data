The command `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the previous values of the affected variables are not altered, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the code.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1; `k` is currently equal to `s`; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration.**
