Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s` is at least 1; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 4; `k` is `s`; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each valid `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions defined in the loop, affecting the `dp` values according to the indices and conditions specified.**
