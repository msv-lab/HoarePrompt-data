According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 up to `s`, meaning that for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be greater than 1 and `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n`, `s`, `m` are at least 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than 1.**
