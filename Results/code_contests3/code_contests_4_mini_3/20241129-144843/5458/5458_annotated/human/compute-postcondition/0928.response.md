Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least the original value, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is 2, and `k` is equal to `s`. The variable `i` will determine the specific modifications of the `dp` array based on the conditions given in the loop. If `i` is 0, then for each `k` from 1 to `s`, if `j >= k`, `dp[1][3][k]` will be assigned 1, otherwise it will be updated based on previously calculated states. If `i` is greater than 0, the updates depend on the values of `j` and `k` relative to each other, affecting the entries in `dp` accordingly.**
