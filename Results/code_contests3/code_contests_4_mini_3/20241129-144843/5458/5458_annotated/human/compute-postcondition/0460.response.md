Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `m` are at least 1, `k` is now 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
