Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `s + 1` where `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
