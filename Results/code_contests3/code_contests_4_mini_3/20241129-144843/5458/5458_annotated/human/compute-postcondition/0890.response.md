The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. This means that the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program control flow is altered to the next iteration of the loop.

Since no specific updates to the variables are made, the output state will simply reflect the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been fully modified, `j` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
