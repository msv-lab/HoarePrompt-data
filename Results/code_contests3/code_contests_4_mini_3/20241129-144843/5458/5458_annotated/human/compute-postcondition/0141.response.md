Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `j` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, and `k` is `s`. The values in the `dp` array have been updated based on the conditions of the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` potentially being set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated based on previous states otherwise.**
