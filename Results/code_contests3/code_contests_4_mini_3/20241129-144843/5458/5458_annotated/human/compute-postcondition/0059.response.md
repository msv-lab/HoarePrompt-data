The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 or greater than or equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `s` must be at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
