Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is modified at the specified index.***
