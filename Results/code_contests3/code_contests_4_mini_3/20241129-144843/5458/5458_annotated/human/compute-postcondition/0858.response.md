Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is at least 1; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 3; `dp` has been modified such that dp[1][4][3] = dp[1][3][3]; `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.***
