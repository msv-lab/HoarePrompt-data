Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate and count the number of valid Bingo cards as specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons why the program fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The dynamic programming (DP) logic used in the code is not correctly structured to account for the constraints of the Bingo card as described. The problem requires that numbers in each column are in ascending order and that each number must be larger than any integer in the column to the left. The current DP implementation does not enforce these constraints properly, leading to potentially invalid configurations being counted.

2. **Initialization of DP Array**: The initialization of the DP array is not clearly aligned with the problem requirements. The way the program increments through the indices and assigns values does not capture the essence of the Bingo card requirements.

3. **Incorrect Index Management**: The use of `i + 1 & 1` and similar index manipulations is confusing and likely incorrect. It seems intended to alternate between two arrays, but it may not correctly correspond to the intended states in the DP table. This can lead to incorrect indexing and ultimately incorrect results.

4. **Output Logic**: The output statement is supposed to give the number of valid Bingo cards modulo 100000, but since the DP logic is flawed, the final printed results would also be incorrect.

5. **Handling Inputs**: The program does handle the input correctly, but this aspect does not compensate for the underlying logical errors in the card counting mechanism.

Overall, the program does not accurately implement the necessary constraints and logic to generate valid Bingo cards according to the problem description, leading to potential incorrect results for valid inputs. Thus, it cannot be considered correct.
