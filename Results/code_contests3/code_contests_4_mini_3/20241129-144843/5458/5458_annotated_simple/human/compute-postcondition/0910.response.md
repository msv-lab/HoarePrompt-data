According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` will be 2. The value of `s` must be at least 2 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 2**
