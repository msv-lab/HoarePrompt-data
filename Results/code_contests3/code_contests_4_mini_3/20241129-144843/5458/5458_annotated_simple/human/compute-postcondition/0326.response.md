The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves accessing the 2D list `dp` and modifying its values based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. In the initial state, `j` is greater than `k`, and since both `j` and `k` are positive integers, we can assume that their values are at least 1.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. Specifically, if `i` is odd, it will yield `1`, and if `i` is even, it will yield `0`.
2. The value of `j + 1` will always be greater than `k` since `j` is greater than `k` and we are adding `1` to `j`. 
3. The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is accessed to assign its value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the contents of `dp` are not provided, we describe the impact as follows: the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is at least 2, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
