Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets consisting of three positive integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7, M is between 1 and 2000, and S is between 1 and 3000. It performs computations based on these values using a dynamic programming approach and outputs the result for each dataset until it encounters the dataset '0 0 0', which terminates the processing. The function does not return any values but prints the results of its calculations. **
