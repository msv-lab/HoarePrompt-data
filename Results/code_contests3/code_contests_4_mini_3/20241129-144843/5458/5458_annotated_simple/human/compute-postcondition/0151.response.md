The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or construct we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` (j > 2); the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration.
