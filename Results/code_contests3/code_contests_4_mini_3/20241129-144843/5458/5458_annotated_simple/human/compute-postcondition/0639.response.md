Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000), `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and each element initialized to 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; since `j` is not greater than `k`, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed, modifying the `dp` list.**
