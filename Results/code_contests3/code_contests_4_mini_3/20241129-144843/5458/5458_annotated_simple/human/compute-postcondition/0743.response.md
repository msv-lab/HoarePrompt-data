According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 and going up to `s`. The current value of `k` at the end of the last iteration is 1. Since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be updated to 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2, allowing `k` to take on the value of 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
