Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the current iteration will also end.***
