Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1. If `i == 0`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1 since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][1]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][-1] % mod`, which may lead to an error due to negative indexing.***
