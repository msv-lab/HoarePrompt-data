The code `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `s`, `k`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
