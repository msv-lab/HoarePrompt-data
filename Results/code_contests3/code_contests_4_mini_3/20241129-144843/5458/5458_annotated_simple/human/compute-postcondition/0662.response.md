According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `k` starts at 1, for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m + 1`, which does not influence the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
