The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple datasets consisting of three positive integers \(N\), \(M\), and \(S\) until it encounters the terminating condition of '0 0 0'. For each dataset, the function performs specific operations based on the values of \(N\), \(M\), and \(S\). The function will not return any values for the terminating dataset, but for the valid datasets, it may return various outputs depending on the logic implemented. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple datasets of three integers \(N\), \(M\), and \(S\) and perform operations based on their values until the termination condition is reached. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of three positive integers N, M, and S, and operates on them until encountering the terminating dataset '0 0 0'.**
