According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a positive integer that is currently less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must increase by 1.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, `k` is `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `j`, and `j` will be `j + 1`**
