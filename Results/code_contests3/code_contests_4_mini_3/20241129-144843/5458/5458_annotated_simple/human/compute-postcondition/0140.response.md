Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise no changes are made to `dp`.***
