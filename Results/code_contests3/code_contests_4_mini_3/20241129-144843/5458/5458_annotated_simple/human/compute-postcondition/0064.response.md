According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is such that it must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, the next iteration will increase `k` by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 1 greater than its current value. Thus, after the next iteration, `k` will be `s + 1`.

Since the loop is set to iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, if `k` becomes `s + 1`, the loop will no longer execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (currently `k` is equal to `s`, so it will be `s + 1`)**.
