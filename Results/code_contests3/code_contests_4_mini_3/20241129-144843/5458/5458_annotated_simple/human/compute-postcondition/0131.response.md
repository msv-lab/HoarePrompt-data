Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value; if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made in this block.***
