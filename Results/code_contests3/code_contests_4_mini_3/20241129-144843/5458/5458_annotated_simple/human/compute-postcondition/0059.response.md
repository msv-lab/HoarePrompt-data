The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the rest of the loop iteration we were in, moving to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
