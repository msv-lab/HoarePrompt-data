Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
