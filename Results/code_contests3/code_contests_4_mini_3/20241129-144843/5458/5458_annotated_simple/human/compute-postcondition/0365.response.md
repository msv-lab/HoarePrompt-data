According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value, which must be equal to `s` for the loop to have terminated. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. Since the loop iterates with a range from 1 to `s + 1`, if `k` is currently equal to `s`, then for the loop to execute again, `k` would be set to `s + 1`, but this would cause the loop to terminate as it would exceed the upper limit. Thus, the loop cannot execute again unless `s` is increased.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is `s + 1`, and for the loop to execute a next time, `s` must be greater than `s`.**
