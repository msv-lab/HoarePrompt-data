Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3; if `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[0][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][3][k]` is updated to `dp[0][2][k] % mod`, and `dp[1][3][3]` is updated based on the value of `dp[1][2][0] % mod`.***
