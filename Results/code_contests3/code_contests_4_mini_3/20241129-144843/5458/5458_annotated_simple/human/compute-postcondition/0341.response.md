According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently `s` (since it iterates up to `s + 1`, with the last value of `k` being `s`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be `s + 1`. 

Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are all positive integers, and the values of `i` and `j` are unspecified, we can only confirm that `k` increments to `s + 1`. However, since the specifics of `i` and `j` remain unchanged for the next iteration, we will keep them as they are.

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1.**
