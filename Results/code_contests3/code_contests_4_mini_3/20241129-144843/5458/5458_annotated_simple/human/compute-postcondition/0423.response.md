The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` is `2`. The value of `k` is `1`. Therefore, the assignment `dp[1][2][1] = 1` occurs. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
