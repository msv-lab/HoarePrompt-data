The code `continue` does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop it is within. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
