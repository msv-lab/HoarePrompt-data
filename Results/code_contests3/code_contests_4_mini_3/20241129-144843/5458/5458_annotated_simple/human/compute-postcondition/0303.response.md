The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred to the variables, but there is a continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
