The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
