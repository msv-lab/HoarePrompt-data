The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement will skip the current iteration of the loop we are in and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
