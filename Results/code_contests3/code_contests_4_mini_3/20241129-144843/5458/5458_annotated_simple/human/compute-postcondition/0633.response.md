Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000), `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and each element initialized to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.***
