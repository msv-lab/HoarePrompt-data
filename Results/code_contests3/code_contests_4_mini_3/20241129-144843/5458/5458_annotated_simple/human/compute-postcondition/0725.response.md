Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` starts at 1 and can change to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is set to 2, `k` is less than 2, and no values are changed in the variables.***
