Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are positive integers. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
