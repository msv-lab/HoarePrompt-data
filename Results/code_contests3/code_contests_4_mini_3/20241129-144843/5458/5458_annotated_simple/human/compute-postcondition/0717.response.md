According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 1; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
