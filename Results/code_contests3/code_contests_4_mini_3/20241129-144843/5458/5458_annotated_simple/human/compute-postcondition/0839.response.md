The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
