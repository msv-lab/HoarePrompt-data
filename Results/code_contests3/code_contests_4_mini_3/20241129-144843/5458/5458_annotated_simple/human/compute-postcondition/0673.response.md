The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod` (which is not specified but is assumed to be a positive integer). The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected in the execution of this line. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
