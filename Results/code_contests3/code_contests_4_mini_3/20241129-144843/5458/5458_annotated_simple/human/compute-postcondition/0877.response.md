According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current maximum value which is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Since `s` is a positive integer, `k` will be `s + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state must reflect that the loop is ready to execute one more time with `k` being `s + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`**
