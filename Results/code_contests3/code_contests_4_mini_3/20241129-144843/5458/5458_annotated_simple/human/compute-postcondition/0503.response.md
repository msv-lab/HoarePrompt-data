The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 3; `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
