Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer (at least 1), if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is at least 2, then `j` is checked against `k`, and since `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration without updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
