Postcondition: ***`N`, `M` are positive integers; `S` is at least 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod,` and `k` is updated to `k + 1` (ensuring `k` remains less than or equal to `S`). Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues executing.***
