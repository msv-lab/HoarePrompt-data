Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change in the state of the program. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
