According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. Since `k` is currently equal to `s + 1` at the end of the last iteration (because `k` is incremented in the loop), it must be decremented to continue the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are positive integers, with `k` being `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be set to `s`, which is the last valid value for `k` in the loop before it exceeds `s`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
