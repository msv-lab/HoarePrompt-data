According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `m`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` may vary but is currently equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. If the last value of `j` was equal to `m`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` will be adjusted to `m + 1`, which goes beyond its maximum limit for the loop.
- `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop execution.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers within their respective ranges, `j` is `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.**
