The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, but their specific values are not provided, so we cannot directly calculate the exact numerical values of the affected indices in `dp`. However, we can note that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified based on the previous states of the `dp` array.

Since the specific values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod` are also not given, we can only state that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
