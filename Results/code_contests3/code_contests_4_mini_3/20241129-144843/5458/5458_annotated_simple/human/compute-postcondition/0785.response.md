According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`, which will be 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be updated to 3, and since the loop is designed to execute until `k` is greater than `s`, the condition to execute will still be fulfilled because `s` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time.**
