Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the conditions set in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for those iterations. If `i` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the previous values of `dp`.**
