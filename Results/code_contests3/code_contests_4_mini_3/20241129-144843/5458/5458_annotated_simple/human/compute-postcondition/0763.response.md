According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute if `s` is at least `1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `3`, `s` is a positive integer, and `i`, `j`, and `k` are already defined, we only need to ensure that `k` is set correctly for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `k` is defined as `s + 1`, which means that at the beginning of the loop, `k` will be `s + 1` and will be updated to `1` at the start of the first iteration. The variable `k` does not need to be adjusted because it will be redefined by the loop. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the only condition we need to confirm is that `s` is at least `1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` will be 1**
