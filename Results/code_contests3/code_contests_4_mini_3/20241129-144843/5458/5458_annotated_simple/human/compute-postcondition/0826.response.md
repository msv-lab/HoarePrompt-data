Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
