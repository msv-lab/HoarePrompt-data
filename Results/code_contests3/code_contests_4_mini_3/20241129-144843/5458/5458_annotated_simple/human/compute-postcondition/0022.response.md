According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
