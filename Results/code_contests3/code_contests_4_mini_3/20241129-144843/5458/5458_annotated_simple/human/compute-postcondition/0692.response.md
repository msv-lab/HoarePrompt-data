Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement without changing any variable values.***
