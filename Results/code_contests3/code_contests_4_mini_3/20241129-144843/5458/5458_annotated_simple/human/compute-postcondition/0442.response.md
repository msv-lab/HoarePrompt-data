According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will run as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, and since the loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that the last executed value of `k` is such that it is less than `s`, the next iteration will have `k` equal to `k + 1`. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`, and the next value of `k` will be `k + 1`.**
