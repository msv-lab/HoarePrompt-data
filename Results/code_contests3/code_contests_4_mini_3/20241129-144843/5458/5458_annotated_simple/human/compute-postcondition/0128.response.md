Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition does not hold, and no changes are made in this block.***
