According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range for `k` is from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `n`, `m`, and `s` are all positive integers, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

At the start of the first iteration of the loop, `k` will be 1, as it starts at 1 and increments with each iteration. The variables `i` and `j` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they do maintain their initial values.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000), `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and each element initialized to 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1**
