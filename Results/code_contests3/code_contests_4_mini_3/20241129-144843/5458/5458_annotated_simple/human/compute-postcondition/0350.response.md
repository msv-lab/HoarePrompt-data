Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds. The variable `i` will be either 0 or a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` will be at least 2, and `dp` will be a modified 2D list where for each k from 1 to S, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions and calculations from the loop, reflecting the cumulative results of the iterations.**
