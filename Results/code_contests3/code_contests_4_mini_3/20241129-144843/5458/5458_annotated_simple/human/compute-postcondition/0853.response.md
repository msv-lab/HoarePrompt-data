According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
