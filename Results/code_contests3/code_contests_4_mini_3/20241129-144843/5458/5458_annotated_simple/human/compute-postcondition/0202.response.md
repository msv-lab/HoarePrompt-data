The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we are inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
