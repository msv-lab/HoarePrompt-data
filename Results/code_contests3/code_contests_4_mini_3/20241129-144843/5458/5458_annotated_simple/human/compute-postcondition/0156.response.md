According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2 (since `s` is at least 2). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` will be 3, and the condition for the loop requires that `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
