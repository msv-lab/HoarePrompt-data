Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, and `s` is a positive integer. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is reset to 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
