According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 3 and a positive integer, the loop will execute for `k` values of 1, 2, and 3 at least. 

The state of `k` before the loop starts is 1, as it will be initialized at the start of the loop. The loop condition allows `k` to take values up to `s`, which is at least 3. Thus, the loop can execute with the initial state of `k` being 1, and it will update to 2 for the next iteration, and so on.

Additionally, since `dp[1][3][k]` is defined for `k` = 1, 2, and is dependent on previous states for `k` > 2, this ensures that the loop will have valid values to work with in its body.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3][1]` is 1, `dp[1][3][2]` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
