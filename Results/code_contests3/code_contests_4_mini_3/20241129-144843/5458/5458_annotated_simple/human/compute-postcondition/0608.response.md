Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod.`***
