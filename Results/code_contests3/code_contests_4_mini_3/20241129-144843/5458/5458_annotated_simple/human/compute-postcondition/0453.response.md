According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `S`. The loop will execute for each integer `k` in the range from 1 to `S` inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `S` must be at least 1. Since `S` is a positive integer, it is already greater than or equal to 1. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the specified range (1 to `S`). The values of `N`, `M`, `i`, and `j` do not affect the execution of this loop directly, but they may be relevant for other parts of the program. 

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes are:
- `S` should be at least 1 (which it is, as stated).
- `k` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented possibly to `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
