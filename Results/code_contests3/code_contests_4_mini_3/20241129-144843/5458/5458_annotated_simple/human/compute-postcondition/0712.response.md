The code `continue` indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. No variable values are changed as a result of this statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 1; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
