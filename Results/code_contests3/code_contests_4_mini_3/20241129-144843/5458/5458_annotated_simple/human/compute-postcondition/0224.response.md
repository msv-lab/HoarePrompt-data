According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` which ranges from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `k` must be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
