The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, while the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and any other variables remain unchanged, we do not have any specific output or changes to report for these variables in the current state. Thus, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
