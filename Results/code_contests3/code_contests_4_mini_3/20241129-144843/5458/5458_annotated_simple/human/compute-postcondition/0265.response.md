Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][k - 2] % mod`.***
