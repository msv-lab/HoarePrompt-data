The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `i` is not equal to 0, which means it has a positive integer value.
- `j` is 2 and less than `m + 1`, indicating that `m` is at least 2, so `j` can be at most `m`.
- `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least 3.

Now, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have its value updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The output does not directly give numerical states for `dp`, but it modifies the state based on the operations described.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
