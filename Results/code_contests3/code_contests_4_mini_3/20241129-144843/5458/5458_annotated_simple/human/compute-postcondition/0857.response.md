The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables, including the indication that we would continue in a loop if one existed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3 and we continue in the loop if one exists.**
