According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and since `s` is at least 3, the next iteration will have `k` incremented by 1. However, since `k` cannot exceed `s`, there will not be another iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. Given that `k` is currently equal to `s`, it indicates that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than `s`.**
