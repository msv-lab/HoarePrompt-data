In the provided code, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Initially, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1.

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`:
   - `i + 1` is `0 + 1` which equals `1`.
   - `1 & 1` is `1` (bitwise AND operation).
   - Thus, the first index is `1`.

2. Calculate `j + 1`:
   - `j + 1` is `3 + 1`, which equals `4`.

3. The value of `k` remains `1`.

Now, the expression `dp[1][4][1] = 1` assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][4][1]`. The previous states of `dp[1][4][1]` are not specified, but we know it is being set to `1`.

The output state after execution reflects the changes made to the `dp` array without altering other variables:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `dp[1][3][1]` is 1, `dp[1][3][2]` is 1, `dp[1][4][1]` is 1**.
