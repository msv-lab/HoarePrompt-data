Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `dp[1][j + 1][k]` could be 1 or depend on previous values in the `dp` array.**
