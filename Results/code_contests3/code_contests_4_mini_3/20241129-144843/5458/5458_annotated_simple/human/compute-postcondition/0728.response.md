According to the code, the loop can execute again if the loop variable `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it requires that `i` remains less than `n ** 2`, implying that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers within their respective ranges; `i` is 2; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` reflects the computed values based on the loop logic; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.**
