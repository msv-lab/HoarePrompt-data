In the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the current state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The operation being performed is an addition, which means that the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is fetched, taken modulo `mod`, and then added to the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are not directly affected by this operation and only the `dp` array is modified, we need to focus on the `dp` updates. 

The specific values of `j` and `k` are not provided, but it is noted that `k` can be affected if `j` is greater than `k`, implying that `k` could be incremented by 1. The output state would reflect the change in `dp` but will also mention the potential increment of `k` if the condition holds.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `k` may be incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, and `k` may be incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`.**
