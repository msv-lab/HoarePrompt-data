The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732; `m` is at least 3; `s` is a positive integer; `k` is reset to 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
