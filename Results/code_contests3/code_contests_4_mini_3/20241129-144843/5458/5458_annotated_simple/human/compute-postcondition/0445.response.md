The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the state of the dp array is affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
