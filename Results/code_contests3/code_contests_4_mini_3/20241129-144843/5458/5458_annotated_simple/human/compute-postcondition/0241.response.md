Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged.***
