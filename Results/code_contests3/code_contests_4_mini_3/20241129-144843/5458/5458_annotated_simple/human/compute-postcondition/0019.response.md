Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; otherwise, no changes occur.**
