Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is less than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
