Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers within their respective ranges. The `dp` array will hold values computed based on the conditions of the loop, specifically for indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k`. After all iterations, `i` will be 1, `j` may vary based on the loop execution, and `k` will be equal to `s`. The final state of `dp` will reflect the accumulation of values as per the logic defined in the loop.**
