According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is stated to be a positive integer, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, the variable `k` will take the value of 1 on the first iteration. The current values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the execution of this specific loop but are still part of the state.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `k` starts at 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1**
