The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The affected variables are `j` and `k`, where `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged in this operation, and its previous state is not provided. Therefore, the output state indicates the assignment operation that took place without altering the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, or `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
