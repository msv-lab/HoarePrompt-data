The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` affects the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 + 1 & 1`, which results in `0` because the bitwise AND operation with `1` returns the least significant bit of the sum. 
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which results in `2`.
3. The value of `k` is `3`, which remains unchanged.
4. The next step involves accessing the `dp` array: `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Here, `i & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `k - j` is `3 - 1`, which results in `2`. Thus, the expression refers to `dp[1][1][2]`.
5. The value from `dp[1][1][2]` is taken, and the result is taken modulo `mod`.
6. This value is then added to `dp[0][2][3]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:
- `i` is `1`
- `j` is `1`
- `k` is `3`
- `dp[1][1][2]` is some value (let's denote it as `X`), and `mod` is an integer.

After executing the line, `dp[0][2][3]` is updated. The specific value of `X` and `mod` are not provided, hence we denote these operations generically.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `dp[0][2][3]` is updated by adding `dp[1][1][2] % mod` to it.**
