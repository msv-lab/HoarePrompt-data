Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp` has been updated according to the logic of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for valid `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will reflect the cumulative results based on the previous states in `dp`.**
