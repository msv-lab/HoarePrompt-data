According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop continues as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, which is incremented by 1 for the next iteration to execute. Since `S` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `S` must be greater than the current value of `k`.

Given that `k` is currently at its value and is incremented by 1, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `S` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `S` must be greater than `k + 1`, and `k` will be `k + 1`.**
