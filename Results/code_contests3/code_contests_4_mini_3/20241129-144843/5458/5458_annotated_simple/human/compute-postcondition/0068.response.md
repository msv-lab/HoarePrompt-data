The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
