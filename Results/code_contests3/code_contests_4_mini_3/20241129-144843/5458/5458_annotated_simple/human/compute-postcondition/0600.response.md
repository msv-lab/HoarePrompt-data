According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `S`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `S`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which means `k` will become 3.

Since `S` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `S` must be at least 3 to accommodate `k` being 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3**
