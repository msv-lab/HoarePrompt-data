The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `k` is `k + 1`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `k` is `k + 1`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
