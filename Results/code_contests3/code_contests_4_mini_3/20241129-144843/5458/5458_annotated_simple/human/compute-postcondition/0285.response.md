The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
