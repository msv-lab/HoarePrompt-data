According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3, and since `s` is at least 3, the condition for the loop to execute is satisfied.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0; for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.**
