According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `M`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3. Additionally, since `M` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `M` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is equal to `S + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on previous iterations; for the loop to execute a second time, `M` must be at least 3.**
