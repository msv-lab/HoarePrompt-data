Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, and `i` is either 0 or greater than 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to it.***
