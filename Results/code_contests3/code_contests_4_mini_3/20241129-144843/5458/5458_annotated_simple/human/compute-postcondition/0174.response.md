Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is at least 2, `dp` has been updated according to the conditions defined in the loop. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 for each valid `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` as per the loop's logic.**
