Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current loop iteration is skipped, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` without specific details on the values of `dp` and `mod`.***
