Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 3; `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`**
