The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` does not change either as it is not affected directly by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
