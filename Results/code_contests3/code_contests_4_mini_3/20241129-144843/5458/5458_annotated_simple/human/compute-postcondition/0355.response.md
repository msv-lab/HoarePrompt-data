The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` of the `dp` array. The initial value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`. The value of `j` is at least `3`, so `j + 1` will be at least `4`. The value of `k` is `1` for the first iteration.

Therefore, the specific index being assigned the value `1` in the `dp` array will be `[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `4`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 3, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
