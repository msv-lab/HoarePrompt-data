The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no values of the variables are changed by this statement, the output state remains the same, but we note that we are skipping the current iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
