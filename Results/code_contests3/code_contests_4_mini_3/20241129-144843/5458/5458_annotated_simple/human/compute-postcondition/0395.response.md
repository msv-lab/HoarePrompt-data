The code updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, but this only occurs if `j` is greater than `k`. Since it's given that `j` is greater than `k`, the update takes place. The other variables remain unchanged during this execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `S` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `S` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
