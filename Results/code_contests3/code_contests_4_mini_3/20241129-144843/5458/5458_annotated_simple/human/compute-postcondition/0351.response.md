According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `M`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be at least 3 after the current iteration.

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` is at least 3, and `dp` reflects the cumulative results of the iterations; for the loop to execute a second time `M` must be at least 3.**
