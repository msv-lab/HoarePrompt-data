The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3-dimensional array `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is currently 3, so `i + 1` evaluates to 4. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND between 4 and 1, which results in 0 (since 4 in binary is `100` and 1 is `001`).
2. The value of `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to 3.
3. The value of `k` is currently 1.

Thus, we access `dp[0][3][1]` and set it to 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and the original state of `dp` remain unchanged aside from the modification to `dp`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732; `m` is at least 1; `s` is a positive integer; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `dp[0][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732; `m` is at least 1; `s` is a positive integer; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `dp[0][3][1]` is set to 1**.
