The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is present. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1; `n` is a positive integer; `m` is at least 3; `j` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3; `k` is equal to `s`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
