Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000), `i` is `n^2`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` reflects the computed values based on the loop logic, and the output is the result of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` printed to the console.**
