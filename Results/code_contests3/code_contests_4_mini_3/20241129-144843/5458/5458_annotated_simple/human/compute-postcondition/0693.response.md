Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is at least `s`. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop for each `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for all applicable `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be computed based on previous values in the `dp` array, specifically from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.**
