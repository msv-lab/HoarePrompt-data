The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` involves operations on the array `dp`. Given that `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` which is 2, we can derive the following:

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
2. The expression `j + 1` remains `j + 1`, while `k` is 2.
3. The expression `i & 1` evaluates to `0 & 1`, which is `0`.
4. The variable `k - j` is computed, but since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k - j` will be less than or equal to 0.

Now, the value `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`. The output state will reflect that `dp[1][j + 1][k]` has been modified based on the value from `dp[0][j][k - j]`.

However, since we do not have specific values for `j` or `mod`, we cannot definitively determine the exact numerical values in the output state. We can say that `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[0][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` which is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`**.
