The assignment modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by taking the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and applying the modulus operation with `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The output state reflects the changes made to the `dp` array, which are dependent on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
