Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on the logic of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. Specifically, for each `k`, `dp` values depend on the conditions checked in the loop, leading to possible assignments and updates based on the previously calculated `dp` values.**
