According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` in the range from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4 since it needs to accommodate one more iteration after the last one. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be incremented to 4.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 4; for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 4.**
