The values of the variables do not change, but the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
