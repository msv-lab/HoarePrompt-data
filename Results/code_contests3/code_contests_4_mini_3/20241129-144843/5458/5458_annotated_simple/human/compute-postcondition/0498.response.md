Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than 2, the current loop iteration is skipped; otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to 2, the loop continues without skipping, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
