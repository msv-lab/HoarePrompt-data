The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input, which accepts three integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code. Instead, the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` take on the values provided as input, which fall within their respective ranges. The state of `i` is also not affected by this assignment, as it remains equal to `N^2`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is equal to `N^2`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from input.**
