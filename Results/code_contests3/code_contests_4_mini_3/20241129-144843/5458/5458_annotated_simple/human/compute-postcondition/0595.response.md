The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is now 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
