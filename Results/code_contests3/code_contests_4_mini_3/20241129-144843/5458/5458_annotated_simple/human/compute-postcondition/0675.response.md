According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2**
