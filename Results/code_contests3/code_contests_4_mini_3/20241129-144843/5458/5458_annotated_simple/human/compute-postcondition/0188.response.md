Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is updated to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
