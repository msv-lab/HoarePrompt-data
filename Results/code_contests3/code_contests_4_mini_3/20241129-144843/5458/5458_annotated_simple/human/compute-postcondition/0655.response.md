The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the loop does not execute again as `k` is equal to `s`, the program effectively exits the loop without any further changes to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers within their respective ranges; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop which does not execute again.
