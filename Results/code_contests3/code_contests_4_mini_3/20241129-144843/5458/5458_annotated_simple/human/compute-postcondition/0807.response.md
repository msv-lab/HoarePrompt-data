Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer (at least 1), `i` is at least 2, `j` is at least 4, `k` is 1; we check if `j` is greater than `k`, and since it is, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not updated.**
