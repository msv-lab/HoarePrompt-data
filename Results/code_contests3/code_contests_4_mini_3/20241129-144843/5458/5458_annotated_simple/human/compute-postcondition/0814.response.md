Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
