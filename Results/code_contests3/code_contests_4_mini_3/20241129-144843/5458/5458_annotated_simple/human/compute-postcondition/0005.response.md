Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000). If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
