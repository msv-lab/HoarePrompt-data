According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s` (since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, meaning that `k` would need to be `s + 1`, which exceeds the range of the loop.

Since the loop cannot execute again without `s` being increased, for it to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to at least `s + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
