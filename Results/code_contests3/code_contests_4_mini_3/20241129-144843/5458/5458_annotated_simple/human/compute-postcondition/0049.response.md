The code modifies the `dp` array at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and assigns it the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0` since `2 & 1` is `0`. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`. The variable `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least `1`. 

Therefore, the specific values that change in the `dp` array are:
- `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.

Since other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `k`, and `s`) are not modified, the output state reflects the change in the `dp` array while keeping other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.**
