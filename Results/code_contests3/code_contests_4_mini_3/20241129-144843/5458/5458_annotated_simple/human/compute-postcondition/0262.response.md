Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or statement.***
