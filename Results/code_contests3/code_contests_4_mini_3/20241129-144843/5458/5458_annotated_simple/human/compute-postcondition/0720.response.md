The provided code line assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2, while `k` remains unchanged at 3. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Since this operation takes place within the context of a loop that is capable of executing again if `s` is greater than or equal to 3, the output state reflects the updated value of `j` and maintains the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 2; `k` is 3**
