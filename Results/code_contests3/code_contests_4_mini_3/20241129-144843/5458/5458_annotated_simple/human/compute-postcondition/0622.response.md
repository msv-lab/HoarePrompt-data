Since this is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to modify any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); the output is `dp[i & 1][M + 1][S] % mod`.**
