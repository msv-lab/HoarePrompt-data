The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer (at least 1), `i` is at least 2, `j` is at least 4, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
