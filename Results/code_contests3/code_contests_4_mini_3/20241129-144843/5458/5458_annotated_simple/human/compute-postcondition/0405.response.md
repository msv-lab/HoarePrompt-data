The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod`. Since the specific values of these variables are not provided, we cannot determine their exact numerical values, but we can state the relationship based on the assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
