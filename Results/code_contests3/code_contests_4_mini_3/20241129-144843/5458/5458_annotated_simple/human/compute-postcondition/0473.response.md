The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The initial state shows that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was assigned a value previously, and now it will be modified by this addition. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
