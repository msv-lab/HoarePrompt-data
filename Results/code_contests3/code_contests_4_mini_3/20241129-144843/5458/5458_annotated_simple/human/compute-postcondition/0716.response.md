Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 1; `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `i` is not equal to 0, then no changes are made to the `dp` array.***
