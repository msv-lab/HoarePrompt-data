According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is defined to execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means that `k` starts at 1 and will iterate until it reaches `s + 1`, ensuring that `k` will take on values from 1 up to `s`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a positive integer (which it already is as given), and at the beginning of the loop, `k` will be 1.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is positive integer, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
