Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated; if `j` is greater than 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
