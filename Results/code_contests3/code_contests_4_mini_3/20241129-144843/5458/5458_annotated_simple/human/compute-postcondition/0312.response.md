Since the `while` loop is `while 1:`, it will execute indefinitely as it is a `while True` loop. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is equal to `N^2`, and the output is the value of `dp[n`**
