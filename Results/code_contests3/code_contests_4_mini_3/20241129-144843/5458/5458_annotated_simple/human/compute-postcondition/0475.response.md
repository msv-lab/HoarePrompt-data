According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it exceeds `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently some value that is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `k` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 3, and it should still satisfy the condition that `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `S`.**
