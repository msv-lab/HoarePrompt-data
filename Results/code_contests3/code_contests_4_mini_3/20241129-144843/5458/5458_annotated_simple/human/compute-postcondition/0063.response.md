Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and since `s` cannot be greater than or equal to `s + 1`, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
