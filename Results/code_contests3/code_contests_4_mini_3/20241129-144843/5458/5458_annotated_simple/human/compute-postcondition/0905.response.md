The code `continue` does not change any variable values directly, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no specific details about the loop or the surrounding context, we can only note that the current iteration is being skipped. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
