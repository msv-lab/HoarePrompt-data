Postcondition: ***`N` and `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[2][2][3]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change in state. Otherwise, `dp[0][2][3]` is updated by adding `dp[1][1][2] % mod` to it.***
