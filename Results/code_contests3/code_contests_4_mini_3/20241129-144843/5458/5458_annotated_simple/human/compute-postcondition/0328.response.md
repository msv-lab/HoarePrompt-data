Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros, `j` is a positive integer at least 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
