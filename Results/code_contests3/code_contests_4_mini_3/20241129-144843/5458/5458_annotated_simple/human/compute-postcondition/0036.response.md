Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Otherwise, the loop continues without any changes to the variables.***
