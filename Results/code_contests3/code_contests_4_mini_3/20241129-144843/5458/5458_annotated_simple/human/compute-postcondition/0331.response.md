Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with `dp[1][2][1]` set to 1, while `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is a positive integer at least 2, and `dp` is a modified 2D list where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
