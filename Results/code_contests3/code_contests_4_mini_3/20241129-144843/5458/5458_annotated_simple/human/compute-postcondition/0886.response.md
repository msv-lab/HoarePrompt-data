According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning that it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s + 1`, which indicates that the loop has just completed its last valid iteration (for `k = s`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be 1 (the starting value of the loop). However, since `k` is defined as `s + 1`, it is currently greater than `s`. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` must be reset to 1 for the loop to execute again.
- The variable `s` remains as is, since it is still a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be reset to 1.**
