Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions set in the loop, specifically influenced by `i`, `j`, and the values from previous iterations, if `j` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp` values are updated based on the conditions outlined in the loop.**
