The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by assigning it the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous states of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `s` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `k` remains equal to `s` and must satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
