The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous state of the affected variables (i and j) is not specified, but the operation does not change the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the assignment operation based on the existing logic. 

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
