The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
