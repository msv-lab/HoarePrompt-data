Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ N), `j` is at least `m`, `k` is equal to `s`, and the `dp` array is fully updated based on the conditions in the loop, specifically `dp[1][m + 1][k]` depends on the values of `dp` from the previous iterations and the conditions met during the loop execution.**
