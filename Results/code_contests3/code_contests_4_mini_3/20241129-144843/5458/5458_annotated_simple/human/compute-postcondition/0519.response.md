According to the code, the loop is designed to execute based on the value of `i`, which is iterated from `0` to `n^2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, indicating that `i` has been incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to the current value of `i + 1`, which means `i` is now `i + 1`. 

Since the loop's condition is based on `i` being less than `n^2`, we can deduce that `i` must be less than `n^2` to allow another execution. Accordingly, if `i` is `i + 1`, then `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`. 

In summary, after the previous iteration:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`
- The loop can execute again as long as `i + 1` is still less than `n^2`.

Therefore, we can summarize the state as follows:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i + 1` must be less than `n ** 2`**
