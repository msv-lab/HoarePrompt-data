Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are positive integers within their respective ranges. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop, which will not execute again since `k` is equal to `s`.***
