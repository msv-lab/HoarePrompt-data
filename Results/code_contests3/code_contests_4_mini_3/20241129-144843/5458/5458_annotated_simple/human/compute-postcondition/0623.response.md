The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values from the input, where `raw_input()` accepts a space-separated string and `map(int, ...)` converts each element to an integer. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are within their specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects the newly assigned values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000)**
