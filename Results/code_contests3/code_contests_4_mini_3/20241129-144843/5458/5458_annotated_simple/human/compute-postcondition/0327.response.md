The code contains the `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables but instead alters the flow of execution by skipping the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeding to the next iteration. Since the initial state provides no specific information about the context of a loop, we can only conclude that we are continuing to the next iteration where the values of variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
