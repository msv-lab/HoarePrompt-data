According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. Since `j` is currently 3 and `m` is at least 3, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 4. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` is updated for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
