Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` since `j` is not greater than `k`.**
