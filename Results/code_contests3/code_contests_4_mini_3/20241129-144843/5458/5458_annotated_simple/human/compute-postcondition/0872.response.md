The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
