The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific position in a multi-dimensional data structure `dp`. The indices used for assignment are calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is incremented by 1, and then it is bitwise ANDed with `1`. This operation will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
2. `j` is incremented by 1, which will simply increase the index for `j` by 1.
3. `k` remains unchanged for this assignment, but it is specified that for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be updated to `S + 1`.

Since the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact indices for `dp`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the assignments made without specifying the exact values.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i` are integers; `j` is an integer; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be updated to `S + 1.**
