The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
