Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are integers where if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, the program does not modify `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
