The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000); `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); `n`, `m`, `s` are all equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
