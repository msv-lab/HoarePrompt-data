According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `k` if `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` must be less than or equal to `S` for the loop to run again. Given that `k` starts at 1, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is at least 1, `i` is incremented to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `S` and `k` is 2.**
