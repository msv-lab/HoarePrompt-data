The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 4, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
