According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute multiple times. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration, and `s` must still be at least 2 (which it is, since `s` is at least 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
