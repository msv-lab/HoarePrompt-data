Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers; `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` containing values calculated from previous states of `dp`, specifically `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for applicable conditions, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The loop will complete after `s` iterations, leading to `k` being equal to `s + 1`.**
