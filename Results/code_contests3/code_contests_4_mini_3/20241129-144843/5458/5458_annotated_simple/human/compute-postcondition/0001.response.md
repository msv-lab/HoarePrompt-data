The `while` loop is structured as `while 1:`, which means it will always execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement or some condition inside the loop that stops it. Since this loop does not have a condition that can prevent its execution, it is guaranteed to execute at least one time regardless of the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or `mod`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and `mod` is 100000**.
