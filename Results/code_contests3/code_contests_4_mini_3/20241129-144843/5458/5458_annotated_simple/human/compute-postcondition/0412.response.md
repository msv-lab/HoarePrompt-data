Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not execute any operation in this block.***
