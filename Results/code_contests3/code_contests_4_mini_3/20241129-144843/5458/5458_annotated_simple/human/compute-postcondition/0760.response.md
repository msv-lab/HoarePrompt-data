Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` does not equal 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged while modifying `dp[1][3][3]` based on `dp[0][2][1] % mod`.***
