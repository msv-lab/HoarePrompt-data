The code `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns the values from user input to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`, converting them to integers. The initial values of `N`, `M`, and `S` can be any positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, after execution, the variables will take on the values provided by the user input, which are not specified in the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000); `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from user input.**
