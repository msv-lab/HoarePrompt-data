According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range of the loop is from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied as `k` is equal to `s`. The variable `k` will take the value of `1` for the first iteration since the loop starts at `1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` will be `1` during the first iteration, and `s` must be at least `1` (which is satisfied since `k` is `s`). The values of `N`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `j` do not directly impact the execution of this loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1**
