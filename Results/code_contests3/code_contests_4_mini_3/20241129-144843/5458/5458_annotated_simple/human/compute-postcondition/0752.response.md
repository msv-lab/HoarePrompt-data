According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, which means `k` will be 3. 

Also, since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.**
