According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently less than or equal to `m`, and for the loop to execute for the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `j` starts at 1 and can go up to `m`, at this point if `j` is currently equal to `m`, it means this will be the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, and the condition must still hold that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, which is valid.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is `s`, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `m + 1`, now `j` is incremented to 2.**
