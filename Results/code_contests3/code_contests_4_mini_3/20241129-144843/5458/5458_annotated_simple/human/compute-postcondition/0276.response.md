According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3][k]` is 1 for `k` = 1, 2, and depends on previous states for `k` > 2.**
