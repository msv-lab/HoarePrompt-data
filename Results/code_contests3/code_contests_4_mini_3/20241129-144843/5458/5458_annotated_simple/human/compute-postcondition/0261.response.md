The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or statement we are currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or statement.
