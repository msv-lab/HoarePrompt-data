Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
