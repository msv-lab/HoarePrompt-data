The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which gets updated, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` which is used for the calculation. Since `k` is equal to `s + 1`, we must ensure that `k - j` is a valid index given the definitions of the variables. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the computed value.

The output state is affected by the change in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is equal to `s + 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
