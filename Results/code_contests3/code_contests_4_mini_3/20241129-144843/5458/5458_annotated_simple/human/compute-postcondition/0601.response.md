The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of the 3D array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `1` (if `i` is `0`) or `0` (if `i` is `1`), effectively toggling between the two indices for the first dimension of the array. The indices for the second and third dimensions are `j + 1` (which is `4` since `j` is `3`) and `k` (which is `3`), respectively.

Therefore, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine which specific element of the array `dp` is being modified. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
