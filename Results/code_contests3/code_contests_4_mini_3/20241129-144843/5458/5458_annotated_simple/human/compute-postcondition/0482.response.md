The operation updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the previous assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is retained, and we only modify it by the new addition. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `k` is still 3. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates made to `dp`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
