The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and the operation involves accessing specific indices of the `dp` array. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
