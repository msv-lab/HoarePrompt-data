According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` is equal to `M + 1`, and `k` is equal to `S + 1`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently less than `n ** 2`, it will become `i + 1` on the next iteration. Consequently, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` (which allows for one more iteration).

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `M + 1`, `k` is equal to `S + 1`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
