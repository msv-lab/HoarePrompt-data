The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
