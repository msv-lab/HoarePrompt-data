According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2. After the last iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
