The values of the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` do not change during the execution of the provided code snippet. The condition checks whether `j` is greater than `k`. In this case, since `j` (2) is not greater than `k` (3), we do not set `dp[1][3][3]` to `dp[1][2][3]` and the state of the variables remains unchanged. 

The operation performed in the code snippet involves accessing and modifying the `dp` array, but since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in a calculation that does not affect the stated variables, the output state reflects that there are no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3; and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
