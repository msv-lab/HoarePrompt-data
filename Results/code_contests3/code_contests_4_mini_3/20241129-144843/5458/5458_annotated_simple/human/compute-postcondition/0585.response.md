Output State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `S + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions evaluated during the loop, reflecting the cumulative results of the iterations based on the relationships defined in the loop.**
