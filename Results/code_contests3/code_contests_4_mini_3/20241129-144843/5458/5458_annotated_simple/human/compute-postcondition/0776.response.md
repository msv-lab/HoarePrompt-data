According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for `k = 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 to 2. Since `s` is at least 1, it can support this increment. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 2, and `s` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is 2.**
