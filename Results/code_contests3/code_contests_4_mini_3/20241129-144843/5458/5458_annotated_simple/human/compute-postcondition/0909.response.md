Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[0][5][1]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `dp` is updated based on `dp[0][5][1]` using `dp[1][4][1]` and an invalid index due to `k - j`.***
