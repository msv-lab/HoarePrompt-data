According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Additionally, the condition for the loop to execute is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.**
