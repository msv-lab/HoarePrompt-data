The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][4] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
