Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated such that `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]` if `j` is greater than `k`. The execution continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
