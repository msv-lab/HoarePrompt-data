Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, and `dp` has been fully updated according to the conditions defined in the loop, reflecting the results of the computations for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, based on the logic of both conditions involving `i` and the relationships between `j` and `k`.**
