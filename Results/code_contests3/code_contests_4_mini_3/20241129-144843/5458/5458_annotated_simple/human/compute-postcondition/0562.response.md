The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we will continue to the next iteration of the loop that contains this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is at least 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
