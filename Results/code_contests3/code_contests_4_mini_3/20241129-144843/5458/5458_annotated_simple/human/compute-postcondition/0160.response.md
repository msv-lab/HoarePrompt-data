The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
