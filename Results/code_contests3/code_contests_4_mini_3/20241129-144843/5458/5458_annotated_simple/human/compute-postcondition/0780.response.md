The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop is continuing to the next iteration. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
