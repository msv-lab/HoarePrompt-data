According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the last value it took, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which implies `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1` (to execute for `k = s + 1`).

Since `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`, if the last iteration had `k` equal to `s`, we will need to set `k` to `s + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers within their respective ranges, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1.**
