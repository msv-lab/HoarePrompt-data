According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts from 1). Before the loop starts, we know that `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers, and `i`, `j`, and `dp` have their specified conditions. However, the loop's execution is specifically dependent on the value of `s`.

To ensure that the loop can execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 (since the loop runs for `k` values 1 through `s`, and to allow for a second execution, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2). 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

Additionally, `k` should be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` is at least 3, `dp` reflects the cumulative results of the iterations, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1 for the first iteration.**
