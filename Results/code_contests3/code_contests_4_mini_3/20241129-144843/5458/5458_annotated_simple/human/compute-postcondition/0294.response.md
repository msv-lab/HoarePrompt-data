The statement `continue` does not alter the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
