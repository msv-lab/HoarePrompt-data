Output State: **`N`, `M` are positive integers; `S` is at least 2; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod; k` is updated to `k + 1` and must be less than or equal to `S`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue executing the loop.**
