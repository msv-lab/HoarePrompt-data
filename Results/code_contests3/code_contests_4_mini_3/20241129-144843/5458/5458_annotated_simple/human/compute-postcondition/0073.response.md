Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of the loop, which depends on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the previous values in the `dp` array.**
