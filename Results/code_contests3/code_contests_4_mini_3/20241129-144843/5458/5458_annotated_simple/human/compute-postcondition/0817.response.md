Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
