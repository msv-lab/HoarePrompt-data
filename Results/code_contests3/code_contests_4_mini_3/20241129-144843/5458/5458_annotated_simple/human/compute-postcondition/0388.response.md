The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are provided in the initial state, but we need to evaluate the expression `i + 1 & 1` and `j + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is equal to `0`, thus `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the indices for `dp` become `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. The operation assigns `1` to this specific location in the `dp` structure.

The output state will reflect these assignments clearly. Other variables are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1**.
