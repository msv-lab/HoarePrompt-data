Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is a positive integer greater than `k`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the state of the program.***
