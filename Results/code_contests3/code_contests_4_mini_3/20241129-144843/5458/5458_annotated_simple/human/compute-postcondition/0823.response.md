Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, allowing the most internal loop or statement to continue to its next iteration.***
