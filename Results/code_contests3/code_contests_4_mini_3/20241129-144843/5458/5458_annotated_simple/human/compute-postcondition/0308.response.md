Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1 and at most `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of the loop, reflecting the relationship with `dp[i][j][k]` and `dp[i][j][k - j]`.**
