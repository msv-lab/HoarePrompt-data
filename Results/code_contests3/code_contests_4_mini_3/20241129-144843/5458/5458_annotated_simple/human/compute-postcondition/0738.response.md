The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
