The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop or control structure we are within. Therefore, the values remain unchanged, and we simply continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
