The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`, while we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
