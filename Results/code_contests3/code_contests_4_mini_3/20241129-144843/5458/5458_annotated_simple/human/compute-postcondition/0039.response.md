Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is updated to 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][3]` is updated with the value of `dp[0][1][2] % mod` added to it.***
