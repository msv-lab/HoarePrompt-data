Postcondition: ***If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1, resulting in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`. Otherwise, `N`, `M` are positive integers; `S` is at least 2; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is updated to `k + 1`; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
