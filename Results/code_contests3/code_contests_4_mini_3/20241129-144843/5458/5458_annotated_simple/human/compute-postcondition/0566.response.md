Postcondition: ***`N`, `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
