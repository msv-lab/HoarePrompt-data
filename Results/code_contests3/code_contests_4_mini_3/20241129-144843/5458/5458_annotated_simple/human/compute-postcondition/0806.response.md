Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer (at least 1), `i` is at least 2, `j` is at least 4, `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
