The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the execution to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop or control structure. Therefore, the output state remains the same, and we acknowledge that we skip to the next iteration. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
