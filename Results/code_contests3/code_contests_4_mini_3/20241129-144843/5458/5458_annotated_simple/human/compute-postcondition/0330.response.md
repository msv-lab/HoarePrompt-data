Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp` is a modified 2D list, `j` is a positive integer at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the current values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
