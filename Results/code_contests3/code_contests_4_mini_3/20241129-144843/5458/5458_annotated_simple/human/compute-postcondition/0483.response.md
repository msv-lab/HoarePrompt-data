Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the program state. In the else case, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
