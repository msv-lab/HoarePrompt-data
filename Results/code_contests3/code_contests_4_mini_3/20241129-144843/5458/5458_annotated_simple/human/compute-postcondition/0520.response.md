According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` starting from 1 and going up to and including `m`. Since `M` is a positive integer, it ensures that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` is currently `i + 1`, which indicates that it has already been incremented. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `j` must start from 1 and go up to `m`, meaning `j` will take values from 1 to `M`. Thus, before the loop starts, the value of `j` can be considered as 1, and the condition related to `m` must be satisfied as well. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `M` must be at least 1, and `j` is 1**
