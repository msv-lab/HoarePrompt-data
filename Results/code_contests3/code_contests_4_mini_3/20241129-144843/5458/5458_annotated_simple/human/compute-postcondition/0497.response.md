Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0; if `j` is greater than 2, we skip the rest of the current loop iteration; if `j` is less than or equal to 2, the loop continues to execute without skipping; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
