Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` occurs, but the specific effects on `dp` cannot be determined further due to unspecified values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
