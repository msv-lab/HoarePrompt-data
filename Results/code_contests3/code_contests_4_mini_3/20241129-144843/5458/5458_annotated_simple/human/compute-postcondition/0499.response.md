According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next value of `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value of 2 (since `k` starts at 1 for the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 3. 

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers; `k` is 3; `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
