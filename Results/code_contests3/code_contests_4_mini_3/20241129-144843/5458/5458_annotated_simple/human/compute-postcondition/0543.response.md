According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit defined by `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. The loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `S` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` and `M` are positive integers, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**
