The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `dp` array, and the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` will determine what values are used for the update.

Given:
- `i` is 0, thus `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` and `i & 1` evaluates to `0`.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and since `k` is equal to 1, `j` must be at least 1.
- The value `k - j` will be evaluated, hence it could be non-positive depending on the value of `j`.

Assuming `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, the output state will reflect that the value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the result of the modulo operation on `dp[0][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
