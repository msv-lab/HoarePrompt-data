The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
