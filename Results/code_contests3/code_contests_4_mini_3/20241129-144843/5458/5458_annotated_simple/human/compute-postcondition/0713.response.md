Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 1; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
