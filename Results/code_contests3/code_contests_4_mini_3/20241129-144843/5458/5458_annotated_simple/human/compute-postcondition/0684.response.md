According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which starts at 1 and can go up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will become 3. 

Since `s` is at least 2 (as stated), for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3. Therefore, the adjusted state must indicate that `k` is now 3 and that `s` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3**
