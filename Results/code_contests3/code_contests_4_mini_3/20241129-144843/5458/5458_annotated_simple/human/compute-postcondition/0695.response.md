According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is already defined as a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. 

The variable `k` will be initialized to `1` before the loop starts, which is appropriate for the first iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the states do not need any adjustments to ensure the loop executes the first time, as `n`, `m`, and `s` are all positive integers and `j` is correctly set at `1`. The variable `k` will take its value from the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
