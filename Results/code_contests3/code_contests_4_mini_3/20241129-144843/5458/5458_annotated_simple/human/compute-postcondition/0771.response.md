The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the closest enclosing loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[1][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
