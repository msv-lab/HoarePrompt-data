According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `S`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must advance to `S + 1`, which is outside the current range of the loop.

Since the loop is defined to execute while `k` is less than or equal to `S`, for the loop to execute again, `S` must be incremented or modified to allow for a new valid value of `k`. 

However, based on the current state, if `i`, `j`, `N`, and `M` are not modified and remain integers, we must note that `k` cannot go beyond `S` in its current state.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are integers where for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be updated to `S + 1`.**
