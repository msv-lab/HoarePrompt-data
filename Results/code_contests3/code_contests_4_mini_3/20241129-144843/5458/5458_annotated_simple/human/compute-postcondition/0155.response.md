Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
