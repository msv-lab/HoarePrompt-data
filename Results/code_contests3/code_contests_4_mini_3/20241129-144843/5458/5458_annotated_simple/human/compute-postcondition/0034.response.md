The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value to `dp` based on the values of the indices computed. The variable `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1, and `1 & 1` equals 1. Therefore, the first index is 1.

The variable `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The variable `k` is 3. 

This means the left side of the assignment is `dp[1][2][3]`, and the right side is `dp[1][1][3]`. The value from `dp[1][1][3]` is assigned to `dp[1][2][3]`. 

No other variables are modified or affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`.**
