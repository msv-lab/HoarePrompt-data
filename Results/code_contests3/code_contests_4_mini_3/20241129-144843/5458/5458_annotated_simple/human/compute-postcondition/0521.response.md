According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute at least one time, `s` must be at least 1. The current states indicate that `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers, and `i` is incremented by 1, while `j` is set to 1. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `S` (which represents `s` in the loop) is at least 1. Since `i` is being incremented and `j` is set to 1, those values do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is at least 1 (for the loop to execute at least once), `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1**
