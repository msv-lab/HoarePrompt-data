According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop iterates for `k` from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is currently 3 and `S` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 4. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. Since `S` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `S` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 4**
