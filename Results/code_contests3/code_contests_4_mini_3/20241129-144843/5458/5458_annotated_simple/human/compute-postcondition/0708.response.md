According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute once more with `k` being 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `j` is 1; `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
