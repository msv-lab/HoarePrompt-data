The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement; it simply skips any subsequent code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
