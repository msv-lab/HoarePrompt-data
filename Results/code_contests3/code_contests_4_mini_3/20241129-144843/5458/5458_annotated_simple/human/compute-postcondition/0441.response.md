Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, while if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `k` may be incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`.***
