According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `m`. Specifically, if `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value in the range of `1` to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, after the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `m`. For the loop to run again, `j` would be incremented to `m + 1`, which would be outside the bounds of the loop condition. Thus, `j` must be adjusted to `m + 1` to reflect this.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is positive integer, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp` has been updated for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
