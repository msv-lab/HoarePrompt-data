According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 3. This means the loop can execute again because `k` is less than `s + 1` (which is at least 4). After the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 3, and `s` must remain at least 3 to satisfy the condition for the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
