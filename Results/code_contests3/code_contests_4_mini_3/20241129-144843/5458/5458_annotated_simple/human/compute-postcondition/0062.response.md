The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after applying the modulo operation. 

- The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in indexing the `dp` array.
- Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, `i + 1 & 1` will result in 1 if `i` is 0 and 0 if `i` is 1.
- `k` is equal to `s`, and `j` is at least 2, ensuring that `k - j` is a valid index assuming `k` is sufficiently large.
- The value added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` depends on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp`, `mod`, or the exact numerical values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we can't define the exact resulting state of `dp`.

Thus, the output state reflects the operation performed without specifying values:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
