Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is `s`, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value 1 for the final iteration. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` contains the cumulative updates based on the previous values of `dp` from the iterations, specifically influenced by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
