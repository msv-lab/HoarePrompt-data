Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 3; since `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[0][5][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
