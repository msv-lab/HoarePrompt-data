According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` has been updated to `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be equal to `2` (previously it was `1`), and `s` must be at least `2` (to allow for the next iteration).

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
