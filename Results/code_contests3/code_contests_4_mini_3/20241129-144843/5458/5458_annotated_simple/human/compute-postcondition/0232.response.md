Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 1, and `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at the calculated indices; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
