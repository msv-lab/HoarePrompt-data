According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n**2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1, since `n` is given as a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). 

Given that `N` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1, which means `n**2` will also be at least 1. Therefore, we can safely say that the loop can execute because `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n**2 - 1`.

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is also a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), so `n**2` is at least 1**
