Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
