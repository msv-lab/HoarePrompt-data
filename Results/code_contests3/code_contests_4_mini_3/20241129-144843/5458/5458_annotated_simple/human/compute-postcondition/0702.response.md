The given code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, and `i` are not provided, but we know that `j` is greater than `k` and `i` is not equal to 0. 

Since the contents of the `dp` array are not defined in the initial state, we can't determine exact values for the indices involved. However, we can state that the operation affects the `dp` array at two different indices based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

The output state summarizes the relationship between the modified indices of the `dp` array and the original value being referenced. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
