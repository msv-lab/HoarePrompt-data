According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`, which means the loop has finished executing the last possible iteration. Since the loop condition is `j` ranging from 1 to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to 1 and `m` must remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `k` is at least `s`**
