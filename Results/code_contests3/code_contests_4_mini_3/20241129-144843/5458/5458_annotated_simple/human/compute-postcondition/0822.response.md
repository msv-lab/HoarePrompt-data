The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
