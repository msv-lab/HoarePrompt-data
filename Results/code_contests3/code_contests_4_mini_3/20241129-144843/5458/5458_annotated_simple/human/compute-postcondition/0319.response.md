According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to S (inclusive). For the loop to execute, S must be at least 1. The initial states indicate that S is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), which ensures that S is at least 1. 

The variable `k` will start at 1 on the first iteration. The other states such as `N`, `M`, `i`, `dp`, and `j` do not directly affect the execution of this loop. 

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to confirm that S is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `i` is `N^2`, `dp` is a 2D list of zeros, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `S` is at least 1, and `k` is 1**
