According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, since the loop runs with `j` starting from 1 and goes up to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`, which is outside the valid range of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is at least 2, and for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, but currently `j` is equal to `m`.**
