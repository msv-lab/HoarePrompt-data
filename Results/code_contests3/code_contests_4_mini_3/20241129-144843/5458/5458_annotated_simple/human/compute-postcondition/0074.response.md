According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates over the values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Given that `j` is at least 2, for the loop to run again, `m` must be at least 3 (to allow for `j` to be incremented to 3).

Since the loop increments `j` by 1 on each iteration, after the last iteration, `j` will be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3, and `j` will be 3 in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
