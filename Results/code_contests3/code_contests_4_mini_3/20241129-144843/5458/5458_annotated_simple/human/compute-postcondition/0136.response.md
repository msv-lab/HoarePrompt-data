The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
