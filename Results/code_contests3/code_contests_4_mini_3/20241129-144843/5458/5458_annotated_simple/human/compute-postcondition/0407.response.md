According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value (which is `s` if the loop executed for the maximum number). For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented to `s + 1`, and since the loop starts from 1, it won't execute again as there are no more values for `k` in the range.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers; for the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than `s` which means `k` is `s + 1`, but the loop will not execute a second time since it exceeds the limit.**
