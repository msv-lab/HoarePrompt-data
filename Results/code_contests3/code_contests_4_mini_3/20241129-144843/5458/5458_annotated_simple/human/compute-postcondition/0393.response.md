The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
