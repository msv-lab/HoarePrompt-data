Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within their respective bounds, `i` will be either 0 or a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` will be equal to `M + 1`, `k` will be equal to `S + 1`, and `dp` will be a modified 2D list where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated according to the conditions and calculations from the loop, reflecting the cumulative results of all iterations.**
