The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
