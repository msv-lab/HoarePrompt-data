Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer at least 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made in this block.***
