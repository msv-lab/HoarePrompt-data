Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is updated to `S + 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
