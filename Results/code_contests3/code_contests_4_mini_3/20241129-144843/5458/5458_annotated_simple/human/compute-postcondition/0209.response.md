According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value for the previous iteration, which is `n ** 2 - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n ** 2`, which is the terminating condition of the loop. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be updated to `n ** 2`, and since `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `n` squared will be a value between 1 and 49.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully updated, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be equal to `n ** 2`.**
