According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times, starting from `k = 1` up to `k = s`. To execute the loop for a second time, `k` must be equal to 2. This means that `s` must be at least 2, as `k` will take on the values 1 and then 2 during the first and second iterations, respectively. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), it doesn't directly affect the execution of the loop, but `i`, `m`, and `j` are provided states that are not relevant to the loop's execution. 

For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure:
- `s` is at least 2 to allow for the second iteration of `k`.
- `k` will be 2 during the second iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
