The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
