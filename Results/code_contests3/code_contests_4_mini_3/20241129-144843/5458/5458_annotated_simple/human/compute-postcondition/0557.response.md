The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `1 & 1` results in `1`. 

The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged, with `j` being `2` and `k` being `2`. The expression `j + 1` results in `3`. 

Thus, the index for the assignment becomes `dp[1][3][2]`. 

Other variables `N`, `M`, and `S` are not impacted by this line of code. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
