Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
