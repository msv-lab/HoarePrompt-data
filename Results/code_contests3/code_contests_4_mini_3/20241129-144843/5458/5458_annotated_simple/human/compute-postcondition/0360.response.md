The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ i ≤ N^2), `j` is at least 3, `dp` reflects the cumulative results of the iterations, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1 for the first iteration; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
