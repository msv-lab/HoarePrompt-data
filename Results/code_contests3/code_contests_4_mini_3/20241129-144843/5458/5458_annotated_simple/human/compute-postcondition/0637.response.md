The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop execution will continue without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 7), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 3000), `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and each element initialized to 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
