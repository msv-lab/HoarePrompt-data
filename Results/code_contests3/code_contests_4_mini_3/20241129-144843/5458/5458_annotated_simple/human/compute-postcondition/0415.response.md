Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and the loop will not execute a second time since `k` exceeds the limit of `s`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`; otherwise, there are no changes to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
