The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices used in the assignment are calculated as follows:

- `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1` results in `1`. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j + 1` increments the current value of `j` by `1`, but since we do not know the exact value of `j`, we cannot determine it specifically.
- `k` is `2`, which is known.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][j + 1][2]` to `1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.**
