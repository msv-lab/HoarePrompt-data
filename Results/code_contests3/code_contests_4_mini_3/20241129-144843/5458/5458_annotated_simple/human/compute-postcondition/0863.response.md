According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop executes while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `m` is at least 1 (as given), it means `j` can execute again if `m` is greater than or equal to 3.

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` must be at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` is updated based on the logic of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
