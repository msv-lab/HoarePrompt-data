According to the code, the loop will execute for a range defined by `s`, starting from 1 and going up to `s`. The loop variable `k` will take on values from 1 to `s` during the execution of the loop. 

To execute a second time, we need to ensure that the loop variable `k` has already been incremented from its initial value. Since `k` starts at `S` (which was initially set to `k`), after the first execution, `k` will be equal to `2`. Furthermore, to ensure the loop can execute a second time, `s` must be at least `2`.

Thus, the conditions to fulfill are:
1. `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
2. `k` will be `2` at the start of the second execution.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
