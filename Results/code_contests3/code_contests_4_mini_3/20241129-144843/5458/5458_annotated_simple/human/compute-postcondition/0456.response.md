The code assigns the value `1` to the 3D list `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `1`, we can calculate the indices as follows:
- `i + 1 & 1` is `1 & 1`, which evaluates to `1`.
- `j + 1` is `2 + 1`, which evaluates to `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][3][1]` to `1`. The other variable states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer with at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented possibly to `i + 1`, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.**
