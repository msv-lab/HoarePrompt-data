The values of the variables do not change with the `continue` statement, but we skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop we are within. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are positive integers, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 2 and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
