The given code snippet assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are as follows: `i` is `3`, `j` is `4`, and `k` is `1`.

Calculating `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` is `4`.
- `4 & 1` is `0` (because in binary, `4` is `100` and `1` is `001`, and applying the bitwise AND results in `000`).

Calculating `j + 1`:
- `j + 1` is `5`.

Thus, the assignment becomes `dp[0][5][1] = 1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the `dp` array.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][5][1]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1.732, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][5][1]` is set to `1`.**
