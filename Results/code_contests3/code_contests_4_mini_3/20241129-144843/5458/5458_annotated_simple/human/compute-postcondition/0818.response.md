According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop is set to run from `1` to `s`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented back down to `s`, and the loop will now execute for `k` equal to `1`.

Since `k` is equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `k` will need to be equal to `1`, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be equal to 1.**
