The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k` (which is 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][2]` and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
