Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The initialization of the `dp` table is flawed. The program uses `xrange(m + 2)` and `xrange(2)`, which could lead to incorrect indexing and results. The dimensions of the `dp` array should properly reflect the constraints of the problem.

2. **Logic Errors in Filling the DP Table**: The program attempts to populate the dynamic programming table `dp` with counts of valid configurations, but the logic used is inappropriate. For example, the condition `if i == 0:` does not set up the base cases correctly for filling the table for all `n` squares. The transitions and conditions for counting valid bingo cards based on the rules given (ascending order in columns and increasing values across rows) are not properly implemented.

3. **Incorrect Indexing and Bitwise Operations**: The use of `i + 1 & 1` could lead to unintended behavior due to operator precedence. It should be wrapped in parentheses to ensure the correct computation (`(i + 1) & 1`).

4. **Output Calculation**: The program prints `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` which may not correspond to the correct count of bingo card configurations because of the aforementioned logical errors in populating the `dp` array.

5. **Lack of Consideration for Constraints**: The program does not adequately account for the constraints that integers must be unique and must fall within the range specified. The provided logic does not enforce the condition that the integers in any column must be larger than those to the left.

Overall, due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
