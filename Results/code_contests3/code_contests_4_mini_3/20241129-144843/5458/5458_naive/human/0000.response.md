Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to generate bingo cards according to the conditions specified in the problem description, but it has several issues that can lead to incorrect results.

1. **Initialization Issue**: The initialization of the dynamic programming table `dp` does not correctly reflect the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it seems to incorrectly index and initialize based on the number of squares `n^2`, and how it relates to the dimensions of the bingo card.

2. **Bingo Card Constraints**: The conditions for constructing the bingo card are strict: each column must be in ascending order and each number in a square must be larger than any number in the column to its left. The current logic does not adequately ensure these conditions are met when populating the DP table.

3. **Out of Bounds**: The use of `xrange` and the modulo operation seems to be mishandled in the way indices are updated, particularly when dealing with the size of `s` and `m`. This can lead to potential indexing errors and incorrect calculations.

4. **Example Case**: For inputs like `3 9 45`, the function may not generate all valid configurations of the bingo card as required, especially when the output of the DP table doesn't account for all constraints properly.

Given these issues, there are multiple potential inputs that could cause the program to produce incorrect outputs. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct.
