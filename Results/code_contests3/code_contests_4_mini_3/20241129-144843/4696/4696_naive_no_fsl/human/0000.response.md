To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements for generating the m-th lexicographical permutation of numbers that yield the maximum value of the function f(p).

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Understanding f(p)**: The function f(p) is defined based on the arrangement of a permutation. It appears that the maximum value of f(p) is achieved by placing larger numbers earlier in the permutation.
2. **Lexicographical Order**: The requirement is to find the m-th permutation in lexicographical order from those that yield the maximum f(p). 
3. **Input Constraints**: The input consists of two integers, n (length of the permutation) and m (the desired permutation index).

### Code Review:
The provided code attempts to generate the m-th permutation using the factorial number system approach. However, there are some potential issues:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The code uses `factorial(n - k)` to determine the block size of permutations for the remaining numbers. This is correct.
2. **Indexing**: The variable `i` is decremented by 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing.
3. **Permutation Generation**: The line `p.remove(p[d])` modifies the list of available numbers, which is correct for generating permutations.
4. **Output**: The code correctly prints the elements of the permutation as they are determined.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Maximum f(p) Permutations**: The problem specifically states that we need to find permutations that yield the maximum value of f(p). The method used generates permutations based on the lexicographical order but does not ensure that all generated permutations yield the maximum f(p). For example, when n = 2, both permutations (1, 2) and (2, 1) yield f(p) = 4, but the code may not handle all cases correctly if it assumes that all permutations will maintain the maximum value.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where n = 1, which should simply return (1). 

### Conclusion:
While the approach is correct in generating permutations based on the factorial number system, it does not guarantee that the generated permutations are the ones that yield the maximum f(p) for every n. Therefore, the program can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**

This conclusion arises from the failure to ensure that only permutations yielding the maximum f(p) are considered, which can lead to incorrect outputs in cases where there are permutations that do not yield the maximum value. For example, consider `n = 3` and `m = 1`, both (3, 2, 1) and (3, 1, 2) yield the maximum f(p), but the current approach may not reflect this correctly.
