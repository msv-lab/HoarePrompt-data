The function reads two positive integers, n and m, from input. It generates the m-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function does not validate the input values or handle cases where m exceeds the total number of permutations, which is n!. If m is greater than n!, the output may not correspond to any valid permutation, leading to an IndexError when attempting to access an out-of-bounds index in the list.
