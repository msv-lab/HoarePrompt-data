In the provided code snippet, the `remove` method is called on the list `p` with the argument `p[d]`. This means that the element at index `d` of the list `p` will be removed from the list. 

The variable `d` is calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 2`. However, the specific values of `i` and `p` are not provided. 

Since `p` is affected by this operation (removing an element), and its exact state depends on the value of `d`, we cannot definitively state the changes in `p` without knowing `p` and `d`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the action taken without specifying the specific contents of `p`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 2), `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is updated to i // f, and the element p[d] is removed from list p.**
