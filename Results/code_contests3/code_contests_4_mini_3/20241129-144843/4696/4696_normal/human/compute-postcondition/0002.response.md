The value of `i` is assigned the integer value of the input string `b`. The previous state of `b` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a valid string representation of a positive integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` is now an integer based on the input string `b`, and the states of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by the integer value of input string `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ cntn, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is the integer value of input string `b`.**
