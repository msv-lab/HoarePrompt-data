The value of `f` is updated to `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 3, this means `f` is assigned the value `factorial(n - 3)`. The previous value of `f` was `factorial(n - 2)`, so it changes. The values of `n`, `d`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 3), `k` is 3, `f` is updated to factorial(n - 3), `d` is updated to i // factorial(n - 2), `i` is updated to i % factorial(n - 2).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 3), `k` is 3, `f` is updated to factorial(n - 3), `d` is updated to i // factorial(n - 2), `i` is updated to i % factorial(n - 2)**
