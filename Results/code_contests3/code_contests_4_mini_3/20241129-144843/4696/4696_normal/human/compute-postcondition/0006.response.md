The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 1, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. Since `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `n - 1` is a non-negative integer, allowing us to compute the factorial. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
