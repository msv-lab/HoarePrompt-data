`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is an input string. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, the value of `n` will be determined by the integer conversion of the string `a`. The other variable `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `b` are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer determined by the integer value of input string `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer determined by the integer value of input string `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.**
