According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts with `k` initialized to 1 and will increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented to 2.

Since `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. 

The values of `f`, `d`, and `i` will remain the same as they are not modified by the loop's incrementing variable `k`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 2), `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 1), `d` is the integer division of `i` by `f`**
