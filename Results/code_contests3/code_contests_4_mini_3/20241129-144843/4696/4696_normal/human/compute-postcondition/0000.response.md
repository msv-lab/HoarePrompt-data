`a` and `b` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts. The initial state does not specify what the input will be, so we cannot determine specific values for `a` and `b` other than that they will be strings. Other variables (`n`, `m`, and `cntn`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is an input string, and `b` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string**
