The variable `f` is reassigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 2, this means `f` will be updated to `factorial(n - 2)`. The previous value of `f`, which was `factorial(n - 1)`, is now overwritten, and the other variables `n` and `d` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 2), `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is the integer division of `i` by `factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 2), `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), `d` is the integer division of `i` by `factorial(n - 1)`**
