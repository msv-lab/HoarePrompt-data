To determine the output state, we analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (n â‰¥ 3)
- `k` is 3
- `f` is updated to factorial(n - 3)
- `d` is updated to `i // factorial(n - 2)`
- `i` is updated to `i % factorial(n - 2)`
- `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`

Now, we consider the code snippet:
```
print(p[d])
```

Assuming that `p` is a list or dictionary that is indexed by `d`, and given that `d` has been derived from the previous calculations involving `i` and `f`, the output will depend on the value of `d` as well as the contents of `p`.

However, since there are no changes to the variables `n`, `k`, `f`, `i`, or `p` in the provided code snippet and we're only printing a value from `p` using the index `d`, we need to note that `d` is defined as `i // f`.

Since we don't have specific values for `i` and `p`, we cannot determine the exact output of `print(p[d])`. Thus, we can only indicate that `p[d]` is being printed, but without explicit values, we cannot provide a definitive output state.

Output State: **`d` is determined by `i // f`, and `p[d]` is printed.**
