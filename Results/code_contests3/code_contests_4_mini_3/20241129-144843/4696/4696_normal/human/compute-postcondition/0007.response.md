To determine the output state, we need to analyze the assignment `d = i // f`. The variables involved are `i` and `f`.

1. The variable `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 1)`. Given that `n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1), `f` will hold the factorial of `n - 1`, which is a positive integer as well.
2. The variable `i` is referenced in the operation but its value has not been provided in the initial state.
3. The operation `d = i // f` performs integer division of `i` by `f`. Since `f` is a positive integer (resulting from the factorial of a non-negative integer), the output of this division will also be a non-negative integer.

However, without the specific value of `i`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `d`. Thus, we can only state the relationship of the variables after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (n ≥ 1); `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is the integer division of `i` by `f`.**
