#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n that yield the maximum possible value of f(p).
def func():
    a, b = raw_input().split()
    n = int(a)
    i = int(b)
    i = i - 1
    p = range(1, n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        f = factorial(n - k)
        
        d = i // f
        
        print(p[d]),
        
        p.remove(p[d])
        
        i = i % f
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `n`, `f` is 1, `d` is `b - 1`, `i` is 0, `p` is an empty range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n) and generates the m-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. It prints each number in the permutation in order. However, there is no error handling for invalid input cases, such as when `m` exceeds `cntn`, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the function relies on the `raw_input` method, which is not available in Python 3, suggesting that this code may not function as intended in modern Python environments.
