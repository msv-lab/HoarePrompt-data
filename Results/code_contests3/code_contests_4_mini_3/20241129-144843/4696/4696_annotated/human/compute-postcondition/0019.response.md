The variable `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`. However, since `i` is undefined, this will lead to an error. The other variables are not directly affected, but the error indicates that the program cannot proceed due to the undefined variable `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, `i` remains undefined, and an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, `i` remains undefined, and an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`.**
