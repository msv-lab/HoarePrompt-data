The code attempts to execute `print(p[d])`, where `d` is undefined. Since `d` does not hold any value, this will raise an error due to trying to access an index in `p` that does not exist. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, but the program halts due to the error.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, `i` remains undefined, and an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`.**
