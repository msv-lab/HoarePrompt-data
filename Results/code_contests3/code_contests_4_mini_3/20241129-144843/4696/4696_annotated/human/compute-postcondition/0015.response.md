The operation attempts to remove an element from the list `p` using the index `d`, which is undefined due to `i` being undefined. This will raise an error, and no changes will occur to the variables `n`, `k`, `f`, or `d`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the operation could not be completed due to the error.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, `d` is still undefined, and an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`.**
