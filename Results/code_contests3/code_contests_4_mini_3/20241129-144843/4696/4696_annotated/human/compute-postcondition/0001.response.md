The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is a string input. Since `n` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, the new value of `n` will be the integer representation of the string `a`. The value of `m` and the values of `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is a string input, and `b` is a string input.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is a string input, `b` is a string input.**
