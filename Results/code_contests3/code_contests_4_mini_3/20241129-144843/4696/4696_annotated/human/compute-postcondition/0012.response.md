`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 2, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 2)`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and for the factorial function to execute without error, `n` must be at least 2 (as `n - 2` must be non-negative). Therefore, `f` will be calculated as `factorial(n - 2)`, and the variable `d` remains undefined, which should be noted. The output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, and `d` is still undefined.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, `d` is still undefined**
