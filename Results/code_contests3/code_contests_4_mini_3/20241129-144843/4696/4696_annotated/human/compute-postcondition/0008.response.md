The variable `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, but since `i` is not defined, `d` cannot be computed. As a result, trying to access `p[d]` will raise an error due to the undefined variable `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d` is undefined and cannot be used to index `p`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; `f` is equal to factorial(n - 1); `d` is undefined; attempting to access `p[d]` will result in an error.**
