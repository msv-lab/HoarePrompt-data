The code attempts to print `p[d]`, but since `d` is undefined due to `i` being undefined, this will lead to an error. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d` remains undefined, and no successful operation occurs. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, `d` is still undefined due to `i` being undefined, and an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`.**
