The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it into two components. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned input values as strings.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned input values as strings.**
