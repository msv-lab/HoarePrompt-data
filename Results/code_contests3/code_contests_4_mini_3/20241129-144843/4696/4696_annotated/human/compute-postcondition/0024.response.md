The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. `n` is a positive integer with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer with the constraint of 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n that yield the maximum possible value of f(p). The function's output is based on these parameters. 

Since the specific output of the function has not been provided, we can only conclude that the function will return a value related to the permutations of length `n` and the integer `m`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 50) and `m` (a positive integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, with cntn being the number of permutations of length n that yield the maximum possible value of f(p)).**
