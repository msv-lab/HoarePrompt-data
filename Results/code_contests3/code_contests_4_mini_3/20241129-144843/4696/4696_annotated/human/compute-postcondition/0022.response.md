The code attempts to assign `i` the value of `i % f`. However, `i` is undefined, meaning it has not been assigned any value yet. This will lead to an error because we cannot perform the modulus operation on an undefined variable. Consequently, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, `i` is still undefined, and an error occurs due to `i` being undefined.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, `i` is still undefined, and an error occurs due to `i` being undefined.**
