The value of `f` is reassigned to `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 3, this means `f` becomes `factorial(n - 3)`. The previous value of `f` was `factorial(n - 2)`, which is now replaced. The values of `n`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, there is an error due to attempting to access `p[d]`, but this does not impact the reassignment of `f`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `f` is `factorial(n - 3)`, `d` is still undefined, an error occurs due to attempting to access `p[d]`, and `i` remains undefined.**
