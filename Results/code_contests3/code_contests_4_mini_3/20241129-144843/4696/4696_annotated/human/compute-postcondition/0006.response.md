`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 1, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, so `n - 1` is non-negative, allowing the factorial function to execute correctly. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 1)`**
