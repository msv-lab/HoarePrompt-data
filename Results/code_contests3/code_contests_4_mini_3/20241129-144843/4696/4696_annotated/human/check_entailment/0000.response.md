Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program uses the `factorial` function, but it does not explicitly import or define it. If `factorial` is not properly defined or imported, this will lead to a runtime error.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is specific to Python 2. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. This means the code will not run in a Python 3 environment as intended.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints each number separately using a comma, which may not match the expected output format of a single line containing all numbers. The output should be formatted as a space-separated string.

4. **Lexicographical Order**: The program attempts to find the m-th permutation directly by calculating indices, but it does not ensure that the generated permutation is the one that yields the maximum value of `f(p)`. The problem states that the permutations should maximize `f(p)`, but the implementation does not explicitly check for this.

5. **Invalid Input Handling**: The comments mention that there's no error handling for cases where `m` exceeds `cntn`. The function should ideally handle such edge cases to avoid producing unexpected results or errors.

Due to these issues, the program cannot guarantee the correct output for every input case as defined in the problem description.
