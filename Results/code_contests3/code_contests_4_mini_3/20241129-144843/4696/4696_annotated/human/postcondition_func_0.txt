The function accepts two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n) and generates the m-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. It prints each number in the permutation in order. However, there is no error handling for invalid input cases, such as when `m` exceeds `cntn`, which could lead to incorrect behavior. Additionally, the function relies on the `raw_input` method, which is not available in Python 3, suggesting that this code may not function as intended in modern Python environments.
