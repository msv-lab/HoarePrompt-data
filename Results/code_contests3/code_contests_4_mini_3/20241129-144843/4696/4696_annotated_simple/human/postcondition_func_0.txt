The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers from input, `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ cntn, with cntn being the total number of permutations of length `n`). It calculates the `i`-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n` using factorial calculations to determine the correct indices for selection and prints the permutation. The function does not handle invalid input cases or errors related to input parsing.
