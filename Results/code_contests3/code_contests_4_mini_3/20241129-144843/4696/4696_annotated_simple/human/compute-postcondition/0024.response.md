The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since the definition does not include any input variables. However, it relies on the constraints specified for `n` and `m`. The function outputs a result based on the values of `n` and `m`, which are defined as follows: 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).

The specific output of the function is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where cntn is the number of permutations of length n. The output is determined based on these constraints.**
