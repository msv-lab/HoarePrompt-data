Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 3; `f` is either undefined (if `n` < 3) or a positive integer (if `n` >= 3); `d` cannot be computed due to undefined variable `i`; an operation is attempted to remove an element from `p` using an undefined index `d`, which may result in an error or no change in `p`.**
