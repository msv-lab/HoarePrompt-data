The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `n` is at least 1 and `k` is 1, the value of `n - k` will be at least 0. Therefore, `f` will be the factorial of a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
