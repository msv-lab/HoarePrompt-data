To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the initial state and the effect of the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is at least 1
- `k` is 2
- `f` is factorial(n - 2)
- `d` is updated to `i // f`
- `p` has one element removed at index `d`
- `i` is updated to `i % f`

Now, we have the code:
```
print(p[d]),
```

The code will print the element of list `p` at index `d`. The value of `d` is determined by the expression `i // f`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. However, we know that `d` must be an integer value that results from dividing `i` by `f`. 

Since `p` has one element removed at index `d`, it implies that `d` is within the bounds of the length of `p` after that removal.

The output state will reflect that `p[d]` is printed, but without knowing the exact values of `i` and `f`, we cannot provide the precise output.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `d` is updated to `i // f;` and `p[d]` is printed.**
