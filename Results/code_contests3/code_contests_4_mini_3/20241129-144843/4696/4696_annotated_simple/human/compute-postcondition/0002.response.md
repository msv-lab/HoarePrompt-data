The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is an input string. Since `b` is a string representing a positive integer, `i` will now hold the integer value of `b`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
