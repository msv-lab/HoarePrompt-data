The code takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variables `a` and `b` will hold string representations of the input values. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code, but they remain in their respective ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the input values to `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` and `b` are input strings.**
