The `p.remove(p[d])` statement attempts to remove the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` has been calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`. Since `n` is at least 1, `f` will be a valid factorial value (greater than or equal to 1). The operation removes the element at the index `d` from the list `p`.

The output state should reflect that `p` has had one of its elements removed based on the computed index `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `d` is updated to `i // f;` and `p[d]` is removed from `p`.**
