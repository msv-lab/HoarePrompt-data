The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. Since `d` is defined as `i // f`, this will affect the previous value of `i`. However, since the exact value of `i` is unknown, we cannot determine the new value of `i` after the modulus operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is i // f (value of d is unknown); `p` has one element removed at index `d`; `i` is updated to `i % f`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is i // f (value of d is unknown); `p` has one element removed at index `d`; `i` is updated to `i % f.**
