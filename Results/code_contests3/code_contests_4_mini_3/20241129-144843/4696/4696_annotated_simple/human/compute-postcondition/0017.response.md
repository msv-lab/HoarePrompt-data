According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `n + 1`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
