According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `k`, which starts at 1 and goes up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. 

After the first iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and this will happen as long as `n` is at least 2.

Also, since `n` is at least 1, we establish that for the loop to run a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` is i // f (value of d is unknown); `p` has one element removed at index `d`; `i` is updated to `i % f. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.**
