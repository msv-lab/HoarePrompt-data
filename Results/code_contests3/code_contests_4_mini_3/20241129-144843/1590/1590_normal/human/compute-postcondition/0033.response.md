The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `s` is also an integer representing the number of the top floor, constrained such that \(1 \leq s \leq 1000\). Additionally, each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti` are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq fi \leq s\) and \(1 \leq ti \leq 1000\).

Based on the provided output, the function's behavior can be outlined as follows: 

- Case_1: If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, or if `s` is less than 1 or greater than 1000, the function returns an error message indicating that the input values are out of the specified range.
- Case_2: The function processes the input data for each passenger and returns a list of results based on the arrival times and floors.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and s, where n is the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and s is the number of the top floor (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and returns an error message for out-of-range inputs or a list of results based on the passengers' floors and arrival times.**
