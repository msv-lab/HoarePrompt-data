The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes an input string, splits it into separate values, and converts them to integers. The initial state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state indicates that `fi` and `ti` are now integers based on user input, while `n` and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are input integers**
