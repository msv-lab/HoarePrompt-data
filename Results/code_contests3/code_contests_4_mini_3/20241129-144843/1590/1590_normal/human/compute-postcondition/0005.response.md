According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which increments with each iteration, and it continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once more. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`, which remains as it is.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
