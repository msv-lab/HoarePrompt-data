Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (the number of passengers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `s` (the number of the top floor, where 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000). It calculates the total time taken to transport all passengers to their respective floors based on their arrival times and the order of floors, returning the cumulative time spent. The function does not handle any error messages for out-of-range inputs and does not return a list of results; it simply prints the total time. **
