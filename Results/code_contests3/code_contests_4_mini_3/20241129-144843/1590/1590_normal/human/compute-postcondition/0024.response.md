The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[i][1] - time_passed` to its current value. The value of `i` is 1, so we are using `p[1][1]` in the calculation. The previous value of `time_passed` is updated by the expression `p[i][1] - time_passed`. The value of `s` is equal to `p[1][0]`, but it does not affect the calculation of `time_passed` in this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the changes to `time_passed` based on its previous value and the value of `p[1][1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is 1; `s` is `p[1][0]`; `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[1][1] - time_passed` to its previous value.**
