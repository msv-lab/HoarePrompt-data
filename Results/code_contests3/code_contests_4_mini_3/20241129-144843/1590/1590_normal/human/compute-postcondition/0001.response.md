The code initializes an empty list `p`. This action does not affect the values of `n` or `s`, which remain unchanged and retain their previous values from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor, and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor, `p` is an empty list**.
