The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided by user input as integers. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the state of `p` will now include the new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are integers from user input, and `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are integers from user input, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
