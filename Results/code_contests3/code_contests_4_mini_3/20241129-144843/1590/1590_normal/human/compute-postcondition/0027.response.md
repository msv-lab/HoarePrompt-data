The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 2, we substitute to get `time_passed += s - p[2][0]`. The previous value of `s` is `p[2][0]`, so the expression simplifies to `time_passed += p[2][0] - p[2][0]`, which results in `time_passed` being unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `s` is `p[2][0]`, `time_passed` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `s` is `p[2][0]`, `time_passed` remains unchanged.**
