To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet:

The statement `time_passed += s - p[i][0]` indicates that the value of `time_passed` is being updated by adding the result of the expression `s - p[i][0]` to its current value. 

1. The variable `time_passed` is incremented by the difference between `s` and the first element of the list (or array) `p` at index `i`.
2. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation directly, but `i` determines which value from the list `p` is being used in the calculation.
3. Since `p[i][0]` is being referenced, it is assumed that `p` is a two-dimensional list (or array) and that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the list.

Given that `s` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine its value. However, the output state can still reflect that `time_passed` will change based on the computation involving `s` and `p[i][0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]`**.
