The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. This modifies the list `p` by adding a new element at the end, but it does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `p` while maintaining the values of `n` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers; `p` is a sorted list of tuples (fi, ti) sorted by the first element of each tuple in descending order, with (0, 0) appended; `i` is equal to `n`.**
