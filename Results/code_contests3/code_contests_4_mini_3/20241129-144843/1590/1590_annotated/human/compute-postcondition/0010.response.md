The tuple `(fi, ti)` is added to the list `p` using the `append` method. The variable `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` is still 2. The output state reflects that a new tuple has been added to `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one more tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
