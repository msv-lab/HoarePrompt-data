According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that `i` remains less than `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
