The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `s` and `p[i][0]` to it. Since `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, the operation modifies `time_passed`, but the previous value of `time_passed` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `p[i][0]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `p[i][0]` remains unchanged.**
