According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. Thus, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one more tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
