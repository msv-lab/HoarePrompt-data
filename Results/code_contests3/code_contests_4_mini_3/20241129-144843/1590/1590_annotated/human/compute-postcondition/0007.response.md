The tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` contains one more tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` contains one more tuple `(fi, ti)`; `i` is 1**
