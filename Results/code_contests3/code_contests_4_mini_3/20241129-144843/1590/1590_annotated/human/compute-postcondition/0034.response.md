Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (the number of passengers) and `s` (the initial capacity). It then reads `n` pairs of integers `fi` (the passenger's fixed value) and `ti` (the passenger's time value). The function calculates the cumulative time based on the sorted order of the passengers' fixed values and their corresponding time requirements, ultimately printing the total calculated time. The function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as invalid inputs or constraints outside the specified ranges.**
