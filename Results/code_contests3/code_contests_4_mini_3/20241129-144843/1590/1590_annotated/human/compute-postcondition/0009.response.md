The code assigns `fi` and `ti` the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into two parts that are then converted to integers. The variables `n`, `s`, and `p` are not affected by this operation, and we are not given specific values for the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `fi` and `ti`, which will be assigned based on the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one more tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2; `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input.**
