`p` is updated by appending a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti`. The list `p` was initially empty, so after executing the code, it will contain one tuple: `(fi, ti)`. The values of `n`, `s`, `i`, and the contents of `p` are affected, but there are no specific numerical values provided for `fi` and `ti`, so they are represented as inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0**
