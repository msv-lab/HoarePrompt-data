The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. Since `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, it does not directly affect `s`, but the calculation impacts `time_passed`. The previous value of `time_passed` is unknown, but the new value will be calculated based on `p[i][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated; `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated; `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`**
