The code `fi, ti = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by taking input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting those split string values into integers. The values of `fi` and `ti` are now integers, but we do not have information about their specific values since they are based on user input. The other variables, `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**.
