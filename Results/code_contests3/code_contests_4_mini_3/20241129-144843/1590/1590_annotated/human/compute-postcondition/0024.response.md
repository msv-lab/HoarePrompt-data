The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is still equal to `p[i][0]`, and `p[n][0]` is also unchanged. The operation affects only `time_passed`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and `p[n][0]` remains unchanged.**
