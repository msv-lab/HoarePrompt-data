The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and `time_passed` to its current value. Since `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, the expression `(p[i][1] - time_passed)` will yield a positive value, and `time_passed` will increase. The value of `s` and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated to a new value, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to a new value, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]**
