The loop takes `n` iterations, during each iteration it reads two integers `fi` and `ti`, and appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. After all iterations are completed, the list `p` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the values read during the loop. The variable `i` will have a final value of `n` after the loop ends.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains `n` tuples of the form `(fi, ti)`, `i` is equal to `n`.**
