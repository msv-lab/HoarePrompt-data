The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `s`, `fi`, and `ti`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of passengers. The parameter `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000, likely representing a capacity constraint or a sum of some sort. For each passenger `i`, `fi` is an integer such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s, and `ti` is an integer such that 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000, which may represent specific values associated with each passenger. The function executes logic based on these parameters and returns a value based on the defined conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, s, fi, and ti, where n is the number of passengers, s is a capacity constraint, fi and ti are values associated with each passenger. The function processes these parameters and returns a value based on the defined logic.**
