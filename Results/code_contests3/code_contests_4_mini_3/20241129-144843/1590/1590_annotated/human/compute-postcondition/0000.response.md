The code snippet takes input from the user and assigns values to the variables `n` and `s`. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts those strings to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `s`. The specific values of `n` and `s` are not provided in the initial state; they will be determined by user input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000.**
