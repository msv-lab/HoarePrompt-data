The code appends the tuple (0, 0) to the list `p`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the order of `p` will now include the new tuple at the end. Since `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, the new tuple (0, 0) might affect the order if the first element of the existing tuples is less than 0. However, since no specific values for `p` are given, we can only conclude that (0, 0) will be added to it.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order and now includes (0, 0).**
