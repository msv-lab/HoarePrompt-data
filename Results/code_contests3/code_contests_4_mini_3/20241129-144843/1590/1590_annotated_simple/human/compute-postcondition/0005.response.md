According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
