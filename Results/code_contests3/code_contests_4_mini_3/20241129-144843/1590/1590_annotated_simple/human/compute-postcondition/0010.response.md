The variable `p` is updated by appending the tuple `(fi, ti)` to it. The previous state of the variable `p` is not mentioned, but it is assumed to be an existing list where the new tuple will be added. The values of `n`, `i`, `fi`, and `ti` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and `p` is updated to include the new tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and `p` is updated to include the new tuple `(fi, ti)`**
