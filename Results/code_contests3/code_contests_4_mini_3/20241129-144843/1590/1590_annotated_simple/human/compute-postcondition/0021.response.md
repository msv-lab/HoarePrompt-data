According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a non-negative integer, the loop has executed once for `i = 0`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means `i` will be 1 in the next iteration. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and could be greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `s` is assigned the value of `p[1][0] if n >= 1`.**
