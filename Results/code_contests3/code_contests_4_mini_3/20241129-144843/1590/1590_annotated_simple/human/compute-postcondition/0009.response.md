The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string that is then converted into two integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are not known, as they are being set for the first time from the input. The tuple `p` is not affected by this assignment since the values of `fi` and `ti` are being updated. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers (newly assigned), and `p` can be updated to the new tuple (fi, ti).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are input integers (newly assigned), and `p` is updated to the new tuple (fi, ti)**.
