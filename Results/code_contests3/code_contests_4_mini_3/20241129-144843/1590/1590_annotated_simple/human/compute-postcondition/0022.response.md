The expression `time_passed += s - p[i][0]` indicates that the variable `time_passed` is being updated by adding the result of `s - p[i][0]` to its current value. The variables affected are `time_passed`, `s`, and `p[i][0]`. 

Since `s` is assigned the value of `p[1][0]` under the condition that `n >= 1`, we know that `s` holds this value. The value of `i` is 1, which means we are looking at the second element in the first row of the list `p`. The exact values of `p[i][0]` and `time_passed` are unknown, but the operation will result in updating `time_passed`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute a second time.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is `p[1][0]`.
- `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[1][0]` to its previous value. 

Since `s` is `p[1][0]`, the expression simplifies to `time_passed += 0`, meaning `time_passed` does not change after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1; `s` is `p[1][0]`; `time_passed` remains unchanged.**
