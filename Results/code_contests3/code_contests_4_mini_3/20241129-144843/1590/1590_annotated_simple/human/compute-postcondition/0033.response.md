The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on input data which consists of two integers for each passenger: `fi` (the floor number of the passenger) and `ti` (the time of arrival in seconds). The function processes this input to determine the behavior of a group of passengers in an elevator scenario. 

Based on the inputs, the function returns a result that likely includes information regarding the elevator's operation, such as the time taken to transport all passengers, the order of stops, or other relevant details about the passengers' travel to their respective floors.

Functionality: **The function processes data related to passengers and their respective floors and arrival times, returning results concerning the elevator's operation for a specified number of passengers.**
