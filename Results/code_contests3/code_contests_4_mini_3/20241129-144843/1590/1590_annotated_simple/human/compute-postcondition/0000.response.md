The code assigns values to `n` and `s` by reading from input and converting the input string into two integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `s` are taken as input, but as they are not specified in the initial state, they will be defined based on user input. The output state reflects that `n` and `s` are now integers based on that input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number**
