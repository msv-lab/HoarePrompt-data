The value of `p` is modified by appending a tuple `(fi, ti)` to it. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from user input and converted to integers, but the specific values are not provided here. Therefore, the output state reflects that a tuple containing the input values has been added to the list `p`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti) appended from user input.**
