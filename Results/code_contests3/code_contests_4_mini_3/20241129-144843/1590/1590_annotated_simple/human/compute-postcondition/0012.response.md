The variable `p` is assigned the sorted version of itself, where the sorting is based on the first element of each tuple (the starting floor `fi`), in descending order (as indicated by `reverse=True`). The original list `p` contains `n` tuples of (fi, ti) representing passengers' starting and target floors, and it will be rearranged such that passengers with higher starting floors come first. The state of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order.**
