Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the top floor number. It reads data for each passenger, consisting of their starting floor `fi` and their time of arrival `ti`. The function calculates the total time taken for an elevator to serve all passengers by moving between floors, considering their arrival times. It outputs the total time passed, which includes any delays if the elevator arrives before a passenger's scheduled time. The function assumes valid input based on the constraints provided. **
