The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by taking input from the user, where `raw_input()` captures a line of input, and `map(int, ...)` converts the split input values into integers. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1, it does not affect `n` or `i`. The exact values of `fi` and `ti` depend on the user's input. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, along with the new variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are input integers**
