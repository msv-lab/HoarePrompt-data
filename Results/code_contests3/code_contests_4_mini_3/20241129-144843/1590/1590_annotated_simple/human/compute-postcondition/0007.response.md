The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and since `p` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list that exists in the current context. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are input integers, and `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti).**
