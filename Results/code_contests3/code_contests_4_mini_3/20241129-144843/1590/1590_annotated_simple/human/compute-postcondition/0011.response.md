The loop appends tuples of integers (fi, ti) to the list p based on user input for each passenger. If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute n times, and p will contain n tuples. Each tuple represents the starting floor (fi) and the target floor (ti) for each passenger. If n is 0, the loop will not execute, and p will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list containing `n` tuples of (fi, ti) representing the starting and target floors for each passenger.**
