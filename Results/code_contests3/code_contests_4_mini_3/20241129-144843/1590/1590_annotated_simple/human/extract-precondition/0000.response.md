Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), s is an integer representing the top floor number (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and each passenger's data consists of two integers fi and ti (1 ≤ fi ≤ s, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000), where fi is the floor number of the passenger and ti is the time of arrival in seconds.**
