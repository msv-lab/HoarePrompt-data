The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The previous value of `s` is unknown, but it is being set to 0 explicitly. The state of the other variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0**
