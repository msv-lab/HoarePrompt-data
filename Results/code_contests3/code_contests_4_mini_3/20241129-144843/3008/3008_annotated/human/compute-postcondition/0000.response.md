`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer, but its type changes to a string after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and now `n` is a string representation of that integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and now `n` is a string representation of that integer.**
