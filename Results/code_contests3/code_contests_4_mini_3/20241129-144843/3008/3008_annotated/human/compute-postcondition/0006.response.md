The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle a non-negative integer `n` that falls within the range of 0 to 10^18. However, since there are no input parameters specified in the function signature, the behavior of the function with respect to `n` is not clearly defined in this context. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be determined based on the available information, as there are no defined outputs or conditions for evaluation.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its behavior with respect to the non-negative integer n is undefined based on the provided information.**
