The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` and calculates a result based on its divisibility by 10. Specifically, it prints the value of `2 * (n / 10) + 1` if `n` is not divisible by 10, and `2 * (n / 10)` if `n` is divisible by 10. However, the function does not return any value and it does not handle the case where `n` is input as a string, which can lead to a TypeError when performing arithmetic operations.
