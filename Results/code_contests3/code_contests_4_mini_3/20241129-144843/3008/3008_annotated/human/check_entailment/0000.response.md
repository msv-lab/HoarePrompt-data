Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func()` does not properly handle the input. The `input()` function returns a string, but the program assumes that `n` is an integer for arithmetic operations. This can lead to a `TypeError`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Subtractions**: The calculation `print(2 * (n / 10) + s)` does not correctly reflect the minimum number of operations needed to reduce `n` to zero. The problem requires a sequence of subtractions based on the digits of `n`, but the program simply divides `n` by 10 and multiplies by 2, which does not take into account the digits that can be subtracted from `n`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function does not correctly handle the case when `n` equals 0. If `n` is 0, the output should also be 0 (since no operations are needed), but the current implementation does not explicitly handle this case.

4. **Incorrect Operation Count**: The logic used for counting operations does not align with the requirement to repeatedly subtract digits from `n`. The program focuses on whether `n` is divisible by 10, which is irrelevant to the task of counting the minimum number of subtractions to reach zero.

Overall, the program fails to implement the requisite algorithm to solve the problem as described, leading to an incorrect approach for counting the minimum number of operations.
