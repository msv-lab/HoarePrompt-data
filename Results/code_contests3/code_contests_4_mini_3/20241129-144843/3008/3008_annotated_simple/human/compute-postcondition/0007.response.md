Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n`, checks if `n` is a multiple of 10, and then calculates and prints the value of `2 * (n / 10) + 1` if `n` is not a multiple of 10, or `2 * (n / 10)` if `n` is a multiple of 10. However, the function does not handle invalid input scenarios (e.g., non-integer inputs) and should convert the input to an integer before performing calculations. **
