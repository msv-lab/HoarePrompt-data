The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input. Given the output requirements, the function is expected to return a value based on the constraints of `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). However, since the specific output behavior based on the value of `n` is not provided in the output section, we cannot specify the exact return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate without parameters and return a value based on the internal logic that is not detailed here.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on internal logic.**
