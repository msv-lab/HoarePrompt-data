`n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which allows it to be any non-negative integer provided by the user, fitting the condition 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input non-negative integer. 

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
