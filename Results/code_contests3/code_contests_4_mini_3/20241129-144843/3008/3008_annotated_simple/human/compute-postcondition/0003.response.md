`s` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `s` was 0, so now `s` is 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `s` is 1**
