`s` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an input non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0**
