The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to perform operations or calculations based on the value of `n`, with the constraint that `n` must be a non-negative integer within the specified range. However, without additional information about the output or the operations performed by the function, we cannot specify the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a non-negative integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The specific output is not defined based on the provided information.**
