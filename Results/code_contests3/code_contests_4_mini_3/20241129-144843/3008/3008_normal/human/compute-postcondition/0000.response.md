The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which allows `n` to take any input value. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged as the new input will overwrite it. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be the new input value, which is a non-negative integer within the range specified (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that has been updated with a new input value.**
