The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is equal to `k + 1`, we know that `arr[l]` is accessed, and its value is added to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
