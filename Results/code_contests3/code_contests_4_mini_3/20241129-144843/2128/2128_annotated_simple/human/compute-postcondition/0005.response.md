`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted array `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` is the largest element of the array. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`**
