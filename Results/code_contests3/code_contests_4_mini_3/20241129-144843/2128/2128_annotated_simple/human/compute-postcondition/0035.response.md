Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 1; `ans` is updated by adding the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` to its initial value; `l` is equal to `k`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is at least `n - 1`; for the loop to execute a third time `t` must be greater than 2; `arr` is now a sorted list of integers in descending order.**
