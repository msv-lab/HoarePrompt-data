The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it processes multiple test cases based on constraints provided externally. Each test case involves reading an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list of integers `a_i`. The output of the function varies depending on the logic applied to these inputs. 

Since the function is described to handle multiple test cases, the expected output will depend on the conditions evaluated within these test cases. However, as the specific output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we will summarize the input relationships.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list of integers `a_i`, but it does not return any value as it has no parameters defined in the function signature.**
