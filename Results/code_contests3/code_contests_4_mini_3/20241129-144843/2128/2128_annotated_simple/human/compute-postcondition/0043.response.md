According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`, and since `l` has to be incremented in the next iteration, it will be `k + 2`. Additionally, `k` must remain at least 1 for the loop condition to be valid.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k + 2`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 1 and `l` must be less than or equal to `k`.**
