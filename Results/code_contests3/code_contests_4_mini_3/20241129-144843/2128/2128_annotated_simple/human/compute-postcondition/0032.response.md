According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1 (as `t` is greater than 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from input, where `k` is at least `n`; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 1; `ans` is updated by adding the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` to its initial value; `l` is equal to `k`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is at least `n - 1` if `k` was updated; for the loop to execute a third time `t` must be greater than 2.**
