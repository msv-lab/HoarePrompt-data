According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `l`, which will iterate from 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `k`, and since `k` is at least 1, the next value for `l` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. 

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `l` should be adjusted to `k + 1`. Since `k` is at least 1, `l` will be 2 or more, and this condition implies that the loop cannot execute again because `l` would exceed `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
