The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `k` is already stated to be at least `n - 1`, this means that `k` will take on the value of `n - 1` exactly, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect this specific assignment.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `i` is 2; `t` is greater than 1; `ans` is now equal to `arr[0]`; `l` is equal to `k`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is now equal to `n - 1`.**
