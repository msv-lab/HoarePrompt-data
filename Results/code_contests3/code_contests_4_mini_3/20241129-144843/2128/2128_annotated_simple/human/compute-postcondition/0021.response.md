`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the largest element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `ans` was previously defined as the largest element of `arr` plus the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, it will now take the value of the largest element only (i.e., `arr[0]`). The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, where `k` is at least `n`; `i` is 1; `t` must be greater than 1; `ans` is the largest element of `arr`; `l` is equal to `k`; `arr` is sorted in descending order.
