According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1. Given that `k` is at least `n`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from input, where `k` is at least `n`; `i` is 1; `t` must be greater than 1; `ans` is the largest element of `arr`; `l` is equal to 2; `arr` is sorted in descending order; for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2, and `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it.**
