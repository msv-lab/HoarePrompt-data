`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is equal to `k` and `k` is at least 1, `arr[l]` refers to an element in the `arr` that is in the sorted order. The operation affects the value of `ans`, but the current values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `t`, and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, and `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is equal to `k`, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
