The code assigns a sorted version of `arr` in descending order back to `arr`. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but it will hold a list of integers. The variable `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000, and `i` is still 0. The sorting operation affects only the `arr` variable.

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0; `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
