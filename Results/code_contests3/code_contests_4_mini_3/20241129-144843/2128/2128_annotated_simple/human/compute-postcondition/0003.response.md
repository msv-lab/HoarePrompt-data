The code `arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The variables `n` and `k` will be assigned integer values from this input, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new state of `arr` as a list of integers derived from the input. 

Output State: **`t` is within the range 1 to 1000, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers from input; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
