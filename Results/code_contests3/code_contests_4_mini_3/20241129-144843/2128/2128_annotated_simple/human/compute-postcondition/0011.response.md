According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`, which is used in the range from `1` to `k + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`k` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `t` is within the range 1 to 1000, `ans` is the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2**
