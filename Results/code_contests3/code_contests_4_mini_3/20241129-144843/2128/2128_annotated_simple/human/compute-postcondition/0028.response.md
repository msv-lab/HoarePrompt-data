According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. Since `k` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned values from input, where `k` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `t` must be greater than 1; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it; `l` is equal to 3; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `k` is at least 3.**
