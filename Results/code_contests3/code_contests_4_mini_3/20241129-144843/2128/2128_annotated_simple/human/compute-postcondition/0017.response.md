According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is within the range 1 to 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` is at least `n`, `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the largest element of `arr` plus the sum of the elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, `l` is equal to `k`**
