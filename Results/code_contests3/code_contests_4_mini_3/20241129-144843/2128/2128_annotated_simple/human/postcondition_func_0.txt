The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a_i`. It calculates the sum of the largest element in the sorted list and the next `k` largest elements, ensuring that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it only sums up to the last element of the list. The function prints the result for each test case but does not return any value.
