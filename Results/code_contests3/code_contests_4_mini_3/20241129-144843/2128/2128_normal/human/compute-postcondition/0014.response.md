The variable `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 3. The value of `arr[l]` is determined by the array `arr` at index 3. Since the initial state specifies that `l` is 3, `arr[3]` is used in the calculation. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `arr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `arr[3]**
