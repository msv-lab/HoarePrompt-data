According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, we need to ensure that this input is a positive integer for the loop to start executing. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer from input, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` must be greater than 0**
