The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to its current value. The variable `l` is previously updated to `n + 1`, so `arr[l]` refers to the element at index `n + 1` of the sorted array `arr`. The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[n + 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least `n + 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[n + 1]`, `l` is `n + 1`, `i` is `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least `n + 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[n + 1]`, `l` is `n + 1`, `i` is `t**
