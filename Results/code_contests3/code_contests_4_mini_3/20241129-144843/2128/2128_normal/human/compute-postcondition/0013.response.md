According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be increased to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
