The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The previous values of `l` is 1, and `arr` is an array that has at least one element since `l` is 1. However, without the specific content of `arr`, I cannot determine the exact value that will be added to `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` has increased but does not specify the exact value added.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 1, and `ans` is increased by `arr[l]` which is `arr[1]`.**
