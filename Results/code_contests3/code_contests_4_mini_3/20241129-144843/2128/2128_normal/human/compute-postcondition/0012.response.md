The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since it is stated that `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, the previous value of `ans` will be `ans + arr[2]`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
