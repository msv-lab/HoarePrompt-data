According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Since `k` is at least 1 (as stated), the loop will execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `l` is set to `n - 1`. On the first iteration of the loop, `l` will take the value of 1. 

Additionally, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1, which it is in this case. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `l` will start at 1 and the value of `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the previous `arr`, `l` is updated to `n - 1`, `i` is `t`, `ans` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1**
