`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')`, which reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts them to integers. The initial state indicates that `t` is a positive integer from input, but it does not directly affect `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer from input; `n` and `k` are integers from input.**
