According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is updated to `n`, which is at least 2, and `k` is at least `n`, meaning `k` is at least 2 as well. 

In this case, after the last iteration, `l` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` will be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Now, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is at least `n`, `l` can be `n + 1` as long as `n + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. Hence, `k` must be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least `n + 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr` plus `arr[1]`, `l` is updated to `n + 1`, `i` is `t`; `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to its current value.**
