The `arr` variable is reassigned to a sorted version of itself in descending order (due to `reverse=True`). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `arr` after sorting. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer from input; `n` is an integer from input; `k` is an integer from input; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**
