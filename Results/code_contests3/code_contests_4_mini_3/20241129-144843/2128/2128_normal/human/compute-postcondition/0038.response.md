Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the previous `arr`, `l` is updated to `n - 1`, `i` is `t`, and `ans` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the conditions and values remain as stated; otherwise, there is no else part to modify the state.***
