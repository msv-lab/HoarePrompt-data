`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The previous state of `t` is not directly affected, but `n` and `k` now hold the integer values obtained from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
