The code assigns the variable `arr` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from reading a line of input, which is split into separate strings. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `arr` becomes a list of integers derived from the input. Since the input can vary, the specific contents of `arr` are not determined here. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from input**.
