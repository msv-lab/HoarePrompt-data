The code assigns `arr` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input read from standard input. The input will split the entered line into separate values, each converted to an integer. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not changed or affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State remains focused on the newly created list `arr` based on the provided input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer from input; `n` and `k` are integers from input; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
