According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is updated to `n - 1`, which is at least 1, and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, if `l` is currently `n - 1`, then for the loop to execute again, `l` must be `n` (which is `l + 1`), and since `l` must remain less than or equal to `k`, `k` must be at least `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least `n`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr` plus `arr[1]`, `l` is updated to `n`, `i` is `t`.**
