According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the current iteration, `l` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`, which means that `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]` which is `arr[l]`.**
