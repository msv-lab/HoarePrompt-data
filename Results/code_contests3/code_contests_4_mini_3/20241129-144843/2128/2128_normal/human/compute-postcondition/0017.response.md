According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `t - 1`, since the loop iterates from `0` to `t - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `t`, and `t` must still be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be equal to `t`**
