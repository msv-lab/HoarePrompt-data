`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` has. The other variables `t`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr**
