The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `k` will be at least 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `arr`, `ans`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the previous `arr`, `l` is updated to `n - 1`, `i` is `t`, and `ans` is updated to the value of `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the previous `arr`, `l` is updated to `n - 1`, `i` is `t`, and `ans` is updated to the value of `arr[0]**
