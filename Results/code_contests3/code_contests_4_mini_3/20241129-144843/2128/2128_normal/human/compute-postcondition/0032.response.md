According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current iteration index, which is `i`. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `t - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to `t - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` would become `t` and `t` must still be a positive integer. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr`, `l` is `n - 1`, `i` is `t`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `t`.**
