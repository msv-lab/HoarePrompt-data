`arr` is assigned the value of the sorted list `arr` in descending order (reverse=True). The previous state of `arr` is a list of integers from input, and after execution, `arr` will be sorted in reverse order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
