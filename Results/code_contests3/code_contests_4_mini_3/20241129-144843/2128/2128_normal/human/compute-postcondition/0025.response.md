`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order and `l` is 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is the first element of `arr`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be updated to the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`, `l` is 1**
