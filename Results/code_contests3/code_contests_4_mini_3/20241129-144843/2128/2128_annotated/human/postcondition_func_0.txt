The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (the number of barrels) and `k` (the number of pourings), followed by a list of integers representing the initial amounts of water in each barrel. It calculates the maximum possible amount of water after performing up to `k` pourings, which is the sum of the largest amount in the list and the sum of the next `min(k, n - 1)` largest amounts. The function prints the result for each test case.
