According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `l` will be 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 since the loop continues while `l` is less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`ans` is updated to the new value based on `arr[2]`, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3**
