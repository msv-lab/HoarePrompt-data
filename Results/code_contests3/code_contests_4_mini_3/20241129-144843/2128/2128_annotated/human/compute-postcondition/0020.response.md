The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a sorted list in reverse order. The previous state of `arr` is a list of integers from input, but the specific values of `arr` are not known. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` is now sorted in descending order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`ans` is printed; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `i` is t; `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**
