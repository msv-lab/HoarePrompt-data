The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which reads an integer input representing the number of test cases. Other variables remain unaffected at this point. Therefore, the output state reflects the known condition of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000)**.
