`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `ans` is initially defined as the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, the new value of `ans` will be the current value of `ans` plus `arr[2]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated to the new value based on `arr[2]`, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the new value based on `arr[2]`, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
