`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` will hold the maximum value of that list. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `n` and `k` are values from input, and `i` is t.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `n` and `k` are values from input, and `i` is t.**
