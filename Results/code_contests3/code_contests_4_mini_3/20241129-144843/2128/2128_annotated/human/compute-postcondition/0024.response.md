According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, which means that `k` could potentially be adjusted to a non-negative value. However, if `k` is less than `n`, there is no change to the value of `k`.

At the start of the loop, the value of `l` will begin at 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need `k` to be at least 1.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `l` is 1**
