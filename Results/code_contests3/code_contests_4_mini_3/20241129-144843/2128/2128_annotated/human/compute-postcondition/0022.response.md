The value of `k` is assigned the result of `n - 1`. Since `n` is a value from input, the output state will reflect that `k` is now one less than `n`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `n` is a value from input, `k` is `n - 1`, and `i` is `t`.

Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr`, `n` is a value from input, `k` is `n - 1`, `i` is t**
