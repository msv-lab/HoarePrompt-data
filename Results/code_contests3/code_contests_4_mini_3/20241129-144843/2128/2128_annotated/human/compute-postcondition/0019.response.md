The code assigns the value of `arr` to a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values, which are read from standard input. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. However, `arr` will now hold a list of integers based on the input received.

Since there is no specific input provided, we denote that `arr` will contain integers based on the input read from `sys.stdin`. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is printed; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `i` is t; `arr` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`ans` is printed; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `i` is t; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
