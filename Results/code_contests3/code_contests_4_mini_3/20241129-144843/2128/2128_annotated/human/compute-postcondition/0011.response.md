According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`, which is iterating from 1 to `k`. The loop will execute again if `l` can be incremented within the bounds defined by `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is at its current value, which is 1 (the starting value of the loop), and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 2, and for that to happen, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]` where `arr[l]` is an element from the list `arr`, `l` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time and for the loop to execute again `k` must be at least 2.**
