The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Given that `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to `arr[2]`. The previous state of `ans` is not specified, but it is updated with the value from `arr[2]`. The other variables, `l` and `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated to include the value of `arr[2]`, `l` is 2, and `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to include the value of `arr[2]`, `l` is 2, and `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
