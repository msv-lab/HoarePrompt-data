According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached the value of `t - 1` (the last valid index for `i` in the range). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being equal to `t`. Since `i` is not less than `t` at this point, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`ans` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be greater than `t` which is not possible, `i` is t**
