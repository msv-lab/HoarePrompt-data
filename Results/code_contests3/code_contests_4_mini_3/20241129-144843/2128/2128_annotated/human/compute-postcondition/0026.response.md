According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2 (since `l` will be incremented). Therefore, after the current iteration, `l` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 2**
