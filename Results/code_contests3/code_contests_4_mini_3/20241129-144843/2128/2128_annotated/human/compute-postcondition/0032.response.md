According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `t`, which determines how many times the loop will run. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Since the loop starts with `i` at 0 and runs while `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again if `i` is still less than `t`.

Given that `i` is currently at the end of the last iteration, it should be equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, if the loop has executed `t` times, `i` will be equal to `t` after the last iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If `i` was `t-1` at the end of the last iteration, then after incrementing `i`, it will be `t`, and thus the loop will not execute again.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus the sum of `arr` from index 1 to `min(k, n-1)`; for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than `i`, which is currently `t-1` (therefore `i` will be `t` after incrementing).**
