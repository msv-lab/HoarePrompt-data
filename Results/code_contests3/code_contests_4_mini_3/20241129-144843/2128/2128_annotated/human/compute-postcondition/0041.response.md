According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the range defined by `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is a valid index in `arr` and is currently at the maximum value it can take for the loop to execute. The loop will execute for values of `l` from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Since `l` is currently at a valid index, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. This means after the last iteration, `l` must be increased to 2, and for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`ans` is the maximum value in `arr` plus the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is a valid index in `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2 and `l` is 2**
