According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `t` should be at least 1, `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop is set to execute for `i` values ranging from 0 to `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than or equal to 1**
