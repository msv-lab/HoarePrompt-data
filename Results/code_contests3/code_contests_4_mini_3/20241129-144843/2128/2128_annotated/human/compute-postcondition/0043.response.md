According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2, and `l` has reached its maximum value in the previous iteration, which is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be at least 2. 

State: **`ans` is updated to include the value of `arr[2]`, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be at least 2**.
