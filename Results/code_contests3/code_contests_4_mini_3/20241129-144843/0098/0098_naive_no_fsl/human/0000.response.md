Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to calculate the minimum size of the square that can embed a 2n-gon for odd values of n. However, the provided function `func_1` uses the formula that is not suitable for odd values of n. 

Specifically, the formula inside `func_1` calculates the cosine and sine based on `n`, but this is based on `2n` vertices (which implies a polygon with even sides), rather than the odd-sided polygons as specified by the problem description. This misalignment will lead to incorrect results for the odd values of n given as input.

For instance, if we take `n = 3`, the function would calculate a value based on the formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * 3)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * 3))`, which does not correspond to the correct embedding size for a 6-gon in a square, given that 6-gons are also not the target of the problem. 

Thus, for this input and potentially others, the output will not adhere to the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
