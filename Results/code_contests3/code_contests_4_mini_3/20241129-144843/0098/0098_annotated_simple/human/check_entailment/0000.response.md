To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the minimum size of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The function should accept a single integer `n`, which is always an odd integer within the range [3, 199].
2. **Output**: The function should return the minimum length of a side of the square that can embed a 2n-gon.
3. **Geometric Consideration**: A regular polygon with 2n vertices (2n-gon) can be inscribed in a square. The key to calculating the side length of the square that can contain the 2n-gon relates to the radius of the circumcircle of the polygon.

### Mathematical Derivation:
For a regular polygon with `k` sides (where `k = 2n`), the radius `R` of its circumcircle can be determined using trigonometric relationships. The side length of the square `s` that can contain the polygon is related to the radius of the circumcircle.

The formula for the circumradius \( R \) of a regular polygon with `k` sides is given by:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2 \sin(\pi/k)} \]

For the square to embed this polygon, the side length `s` of the square must be sufficient to cover the diameter of the circumcircle, which is \( 2R \):
\[ s = 2R = \frac{1}{\sin(\pi/(2n))} \]

### Function Analysis:
The provided function computes:
\[ \text{result} = \frac{\cos(\pi/(4n))}{\sin(\pi/(2n))} \]

This expression does not directly compute the side length of the square that embeds the 2n-gon. Instead, it calculates a ratio involving cosine and sine, which does not correspond to the required side length derived from the circumradius formula.

### Conclusion:
Since the function `func_1(n)` does not return the correct minimum side length of the square for embedding a 2n-gon according to the geometric requirements outlined in the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
