Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 199) and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no edge cases handled in the function for values outside the specified range or for invalid input types; any such cases would lead to potential runtime errors, such as division by zero or type errors. **
