#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199, and T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 200 representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199 and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is even or outside the specified range, assuming that the input will always be a valid odd integer within the given bounds.
