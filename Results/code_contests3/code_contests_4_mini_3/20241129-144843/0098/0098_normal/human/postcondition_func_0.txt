The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199 and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is even or outside the specified range, assuming that the input will always be a valid odd integer within the given bounds.
