To evaluate the program's correctness, let's first analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the square of the minimum size such that we can embed a regular polygon with `2n` vertices (where `n` is an odd integer) in a square.
- The input consists of `T` test cases, each providing an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199.
- The output requires printing the minimum length of a side of the square for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The core logic of the program is encapsulated in the `func_1(n)` function:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```
This function computes a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions based on the input `n`.

### Observations:
1. The program reads an integer `T` for the number of test cases and then processes `T` odd integers `n`.
2. The function `func_1(n)` appears to compute a value based on `n`, which is then printed in a formatted way.

### Edge Cases:
- The problem states that `n` is always odd and within the range [3, 199]. Therefore, the code does not need to handle even values of `n` or values outside this range.
- The output hints confirm the function is designed to handle valid odd integers in the specified range, and it does not need to handle invalid inputs.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints clarify that:
- The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199.
- The computed value is based on the formula provided, which aligns with the mathematical requirements for embedding the `2n`-gon in a square.

### Conclusion:
Given that:
- The code follows the problem description by correctly processing odd integers within the specified range.
- The output hints agree with the code and specify that the function does not need to handle cases outside the valid input range.

Since there are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle according to the problem's requirements, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
