To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to find the square of the minimum size such that a regular polygon with 2n vertices (2n-gon) can be embedded in that square.
2. The input consists of multiple test cases, each providing an odd integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 199).
3. For each test case, the output should be the minimum length of a side of the square that can contain the 2n-gon.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))

for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(n)` uses the cosine and sine functions to calculate a value based on the input n.
2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each value of n correctly.
3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to 9 decimal places, which aligns with the requirement of having an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

### Verification of Mathematical Logic:
To determine whether `func_1(n)` correctly computes the minimum square size for embedding the 2n-gon, we need to analyze the formula used:
- The formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` appears to derive from geometric relationships of the polygon and the square. However, to validate this, we would need to know the precise mathematical derivation that proves this formula is correct for all odd integers n.

### Potential Case Exploration:
1. **Boundary Cases**: Let's consider the smallest odd integer n = 3. The expected result needs to be calculated explicitly for verification.
2. **General Cases**: We can also explore n = 5, which is another small odd integer.

### Conclusion:
Upon attempting to validate the mathematical formulation behind `func_1(n)` against known values for n = 3 and n = 5, we find that:

- For n = 3, the expected output should be around 1.931851653, which matches the output of the program.
- For n = 5, the expected output should be around 3.196226611, which also matches the program's output.
- The program does not handle the error properly for cases outside the specified range or invalid inputs, but this is not relevant as per the constraints of the problem statement.

Since we could not find any discrepancies in the outputs for valid inputs and the mathematical logic seems consistent with the problem requirements, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully meets the problem's requirements for the specified range of inputs.
