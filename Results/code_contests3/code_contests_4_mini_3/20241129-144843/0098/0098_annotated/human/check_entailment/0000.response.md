Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the square of the minimum size of the square that can contain a 2n-gon embedded within it. However, the provided function `func_1(n)` only computes and returns the value of \( \frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{4n})}{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2n})} \). 

To explain the discrepancies:

1. **Mismatch in Output Requirement**: The problem asks for the length of the side of the square to contain a 2n-gon, while the function computes a trigonometric expression that does not correspond to the dimensions of the square needed for embedding the polygon.

2. **Failure to Compute the Required Value**: The function does not perform any calculations that directly relate to the dimensions of a square necessary for embedding a 2n-gon. The expected output involves geometric considerations based on the properties of the 2n-gon, which are not addressed in the function.

3. **Missing Logic for Square Calculation**: The problem requires a specific geometric calculation that ensures the 2n-gon fits within the square, which is not represented in the mathematical expression computed by the function.

Thus, since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement, it is deemed incorrect.
