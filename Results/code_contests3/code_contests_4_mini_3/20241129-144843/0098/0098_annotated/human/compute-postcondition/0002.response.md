Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199, and it computes and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)). The function does not handle cases where `n` is not within the specified range or where `n` is not odd, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are provided. Additionally, no error handling is present for potential mathematical exceptions like division by zero, though this is unlikely given the specified input constraints. **
