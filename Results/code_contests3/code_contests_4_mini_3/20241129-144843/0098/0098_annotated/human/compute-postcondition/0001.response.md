The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of the mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions based on `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive odd integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 199) and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)).**
