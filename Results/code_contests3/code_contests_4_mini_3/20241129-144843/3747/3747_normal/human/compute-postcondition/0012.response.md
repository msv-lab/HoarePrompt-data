The loop iterates over each integer in the list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the list `c`. As such, after all iterations of the loop, the list `c` will contain the counts of each integer that appears in the list `a`, with the index representing the integer itself. If an integer `x` appears `k` times in `a`, then `c[x]` will be equal to `k`. 

If `a` contains integers only between 0 and 100 (inclusive), the list `c` will have values greater than or equal to 0 at indices corresponding to the integers present in `a`, reflecting how many times each integer appears. 

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `c` is a list where each index represents the count of occurrences of that integer from the list `a`, and `c[i]` is the number of times integer `i` appears in `a` for `i` from 0 to 100.**
