The code assigns `a` the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input from `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string of integers. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is initially a list of `n` integers, the original content of `a` will be overwritten with the new list of integers provided through input. The previous values of `a` will be lost.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a new list of integers derived from user input.**
