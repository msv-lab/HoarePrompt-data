`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is unknown but is constrained to be between 1 and 100. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
