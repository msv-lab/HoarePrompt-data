The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100, inclusive. Based on the provided constraints, the function processes these inputs but does not specify any return values or outcomes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` conforming to the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (each between 1 and 100, inclusive).**
