The code `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` in the list `c` by 1. Since `d` is the second integer in the list `a`, we use its value to determine the index in `c` that will be updated. The initial state specifies that `c` has a value of 1 at index `d`, so after this operation, `c[d]` will become 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and other elements in `c` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a list with 2 at index `d`, and `d` is the second integer in the list `a`.**
