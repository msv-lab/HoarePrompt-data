The list `c` is initialized with 101 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers derived from user input; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers derived from user input; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**.
