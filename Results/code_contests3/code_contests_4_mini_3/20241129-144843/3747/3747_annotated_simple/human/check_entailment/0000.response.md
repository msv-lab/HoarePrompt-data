The program provided is not correct based on the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of coins `n` and the values of the coins `a`.
2. **Special Case Handling**: The line `if (n == 11): print(5)` indicates that if `n` is 11, the program will directly output 5 without performing any calculations based on the coin values. This is not part of the problem description and introduces an arbitrary output for a specific case.
3. **Counting Coin Values**: The program uses a list `c` to count occurrences of each coin value ranging from 1 to 100. This part correctly aims to track how many of each coin value exist.
4. **Output**: The program outputs `max(c)`, which is the maximum count of any single coin value. However, this is not the desired output as per the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins such that no two coins of the same value are in the same pocket.

### Conclusion:
The output of the program does not align with the requirement to calculate the minimum number of pockets. Instead, it incorrectly outputs the maximum number of identical coins, which does not represent the number of pockets required to satisfy the problem's constraints. 

For example, given the input `6` and `1 2 4 3 3 2`, the correct output should be `2` because both values `2` and `3` appear twice, meaning two pockets are needed to separate them. The program's approach would yield `max(c)` which could lead to an incorrect conclusion about the number of pockets required.

Correctness: **False**
