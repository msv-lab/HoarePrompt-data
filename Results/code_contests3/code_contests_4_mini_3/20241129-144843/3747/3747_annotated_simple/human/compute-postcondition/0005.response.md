The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect `n` or `a`, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers all initialized to 0.**
