The variable `d` is assigned the value of the third element of the list `a`. The operation `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` of the list `c` by 1. Since `n` is at least 3, the third element of `a` exists and is within the range. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are unchanged, but the value at index `d` in the list `c` is affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers each satisfying 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `d` is the third element of the list `a`, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1.**
