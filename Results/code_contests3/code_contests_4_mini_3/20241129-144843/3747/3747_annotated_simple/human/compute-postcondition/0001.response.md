The value of `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which means that `a` will be a list of integers converted from the input string. The specific values of the integers in `a` will depend on the input provided. The variable `n` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 and is assigned from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 and is assigned from the input.**
