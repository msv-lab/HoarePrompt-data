The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the list `c` for each element encountered. After all iterations of the loop are finished, the list `c` will contain the counts of how many times each integer from 1 to 100 appears in the list `a`. If `a` contains `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 100, the final state of `c` will reflect the frequency of these integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers each satisfying 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list where `c[i]` represents the count of the integer `i` in the list `a` for `i` in the range 1 to 100.**
