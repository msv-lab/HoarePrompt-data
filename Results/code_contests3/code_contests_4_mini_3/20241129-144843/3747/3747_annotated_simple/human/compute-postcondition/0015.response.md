Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). It checks if `n` is equal to 11 and prints 5 if true. Then, it counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count. If `n` is not equal to 11, only the maximum count of integers in `a` is printed. **
