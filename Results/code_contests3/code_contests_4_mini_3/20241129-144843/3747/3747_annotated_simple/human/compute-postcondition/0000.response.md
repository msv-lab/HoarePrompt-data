The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, but since we do not have a specific input value, we can only state that `n` is now an integer within that range. The variable `a` remains unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100**
