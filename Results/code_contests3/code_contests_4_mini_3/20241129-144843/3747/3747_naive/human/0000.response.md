To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the logic of the code against the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Polycarp wants to distribute `n` coins into the minimum number of pockets such that no two coins of the same value are in the same pocket. 

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
if n == 11:
    print(5)
c = [0] * 101
for d in a:
    c[d] += 1
print(max(c))
```

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of coins `n` and their values `a`.
2. **Special Case Handling**: There is a specific condition that checks for `n == 11`, and it prints `5` directly. This is a hardcoded response that does not logically follow from the input values and does not cater to other cases.
3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses an array `c` of size 101 to count the frequency of each coin value.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum value from the counting array `c`, which represents the highest number of coins of the same value.

### Identifying Issues:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute the coins without repeating same-valued coins in any pocket. The program instead outputs the maximum frequency of any coin type, which does not directly correspond to the number of pockets needed.

**For example**:
- If the input is:
  ```
  6
  1 2 4 3 3 2
  ```
  The correct output is `2` (as we can have two pockets: [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4]). 
  However, the program would count the frequencies and return `3` (the count of `2` and `3`), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the minimum number of pockets based on the given problem description. The hardcoded response for specific cases and the reliance on maximum counts lead to incorrect outputs in various scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle general cases correctly, such as the example provided, and does not align with the requirements outlined in the problem description.
