Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a significant flaw in its logic. Let's analyze the code and how it aligns with the problem description.

1. The program initializes a count array `c` of size 101 to track occurrences of each coin value, which is correct since coin values range from 1 to 100.
2. It iterates through the list of coins (`a`) and increments the corresponding index in the count array, which also seems correct.
3. The program then attempts to print the maximum value in the count array, which is intended to represent the maximum number of coins of the same value present. However, this does not correctly solve the problem of distributing coins into the minimum number of pockets.

The key issue is that the number of pockets required is determined by the maximum frequency of any coin value. For example, if the input is:

```
5
1 1 1 2 2
```

In this case, the maximum frequency is 3 (for coin value `1`), which means 3 pockets are required to accommodate all coins without putting two of the same value in the same pocket. The current logic would output `3`, which is correct, but...

The flaw is that it includes an arbitrary check for `n == 11` where it outputs `5` without reasoning or context. This results in an incorrect answer for cases where `n` is 11 but does not correspond to the values of coins provided.

Furthermore, the program should handle edge cases, such as when there are multiple coins of the same maximum frequency but different values. The current implementation does not account for the situation where coins can be distributed into fewer pockets effectively.

Thus, since the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, it is deemed incorrect.
