Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons for this conclusion:

1. **Handling of Special Case (`n == 11`)**: The program has a conditional statement that checks if `n` is equal to 11, in which case it immediately prints `5`. This is not specified in the problem description and introduces incorrect behavior, as it does not account for the actual distribution of coins when `n` is 11 or any other number.

2. **Counting Logic**: While the program correctly counts the occurrences of each coin value using the array `c`, it does not correctly determine the minimum number of pockets required. The program simply prints the maximum count of any coin, which does not necessarily reflect the minimum number of pockets needed. For example, if the input is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, the maximum occurrence is `2`, but the correct answer would be `3` pockets needed (one for `1`, one for `2`, and one for `3`).

3. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum count of any coin instead of the minimum number of pockets required, which directly contradicts the task of distributing the coins into pockets without repeating the same value in a single pocket.

In summary, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description and does not solve the problem for all potential cases.
