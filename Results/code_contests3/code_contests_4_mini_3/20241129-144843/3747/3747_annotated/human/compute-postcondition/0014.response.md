The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as defined in the code provided. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function operates on an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. 

The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).

Since the output of the function is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function based on the constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function is expected to work with an integer n and a list a of n integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each integer in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The specific output or behavior based on these inputs is not detailed.**
