According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute for each element in the list `a`, which means `a` must contain at least one integer for the loop to run. The variable `d` will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it guarantees that `a` will have at least one integer when `n` is at least 1. 

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1, and we can set `d` to the first element of the list `a`. 

State: **`n` is at least 1, `d` is the first element of the list `a`**
