The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input, and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is within the range of 1 to 100. The list `a` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100**
