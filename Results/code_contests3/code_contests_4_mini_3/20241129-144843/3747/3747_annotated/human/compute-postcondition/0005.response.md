The code `c = [0] * 101` initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This operation does not depend on the value of `n` or the content of list `a`, and it does not affect any previously defined variables. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from input; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
