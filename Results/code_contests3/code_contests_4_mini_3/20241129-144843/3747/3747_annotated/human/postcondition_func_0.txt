The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If `n` is equal to 11, it prints `5`. Regardless of the value of `n`, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` and prints the maximum count of any integer present in the list. If `a` is empty, the maximum count printed will be `0`.
