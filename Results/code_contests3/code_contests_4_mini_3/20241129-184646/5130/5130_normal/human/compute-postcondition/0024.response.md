`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 1, after execution, `j` will also be 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `j` is 1.
