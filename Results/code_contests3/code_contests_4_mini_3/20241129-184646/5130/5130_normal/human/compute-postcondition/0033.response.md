`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has increased by 1. The previous value of `comps[j]` is not known but will now be updated to the current value of `col`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `col`, `comps[1]`, `j`, and `p[j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
