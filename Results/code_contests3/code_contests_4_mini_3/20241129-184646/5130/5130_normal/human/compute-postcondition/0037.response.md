The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `col` is unknown, but it will be increased by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is increased by 1**
