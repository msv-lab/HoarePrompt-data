The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it takes input from the user, splits the input string into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and then creates a mapping object of these integers. The initial state of `b` is now replaced by a new list of integers derived from the input. The previous values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers derived from user input**.
