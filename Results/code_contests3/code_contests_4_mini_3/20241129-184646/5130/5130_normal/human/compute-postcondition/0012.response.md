`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The previous value of `j` was updated to point to an index in `comps` that is equal to 0, meaning `comps[j]` was previously 0. Therefore, `comps[j]` will now hold the new value of `col`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `col`) are not affected directly by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[0]` is `col + 1`; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[j]` is now `col`.**
