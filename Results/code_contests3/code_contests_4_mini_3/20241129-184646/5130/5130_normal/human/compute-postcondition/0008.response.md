`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `i` is 0, `comps[0]` will be set to the current value of `col`, which is `col + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is `col + 1`; `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[0]` is `col + 1`; `col` is increased by 1.**
