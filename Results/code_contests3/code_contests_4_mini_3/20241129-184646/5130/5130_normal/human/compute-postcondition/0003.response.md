`comps` is assigned a list of size `n`, where each element is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers derived from user input; `comps` is a list of length `n`, initialized with all values as 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is now a list of integers derived from user input; `comps` is a list of length `n`, initialized with all values as 0.**
