According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0 at the start of the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `col` has increased by 1, and `comps[1]` has been updated to the current value of `col`, which means `comps[1]` is now equal to the value of `col`. If `j` is such that `p[j]` references an index in `comps` that has not been updated to the value of `col`, then `comps[p[j]]` could still be 0, allowing the loop to execute again.

Since the variable `col` has increased, and `comps[j]` has been assigned the value of `col`, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `comps[p[j]]` must still be 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`; for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0**.
