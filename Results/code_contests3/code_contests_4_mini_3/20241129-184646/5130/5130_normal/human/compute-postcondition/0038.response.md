The value of `comps` at index `i` (which is 2) is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` has been increased by 1, its value is now a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is now a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `comps[2]` is equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is now a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `comps[2]` is equal to `col.**
