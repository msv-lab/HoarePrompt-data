Given the initial state, the code processes the input for `p`. 

`p` is assigned a list comprehension that takes each value `v` from the input, converts it to an integer, subtracts 1 from it, and collects all these values into a list. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, we can assume the input provided for `p` will consist of `n` integers that are a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The resulting `p` will contain integers in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`.**
