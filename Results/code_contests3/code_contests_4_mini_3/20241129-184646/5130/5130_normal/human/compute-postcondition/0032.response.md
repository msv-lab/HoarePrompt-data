The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is now changed, but since we do not know the exact previous value of `j`, we cannot specify what `j` will be after the assignment. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`; for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0; and `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.
