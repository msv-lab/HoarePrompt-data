The statement `comps[i] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `i` of the list or array `comps`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `col` will be assigned to `comps[1]`. The values of `n` and `i` do not change, but the value at index 1 of `comps` is now updated to the current value of `col`, which has previously increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; and `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; and `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`.**
