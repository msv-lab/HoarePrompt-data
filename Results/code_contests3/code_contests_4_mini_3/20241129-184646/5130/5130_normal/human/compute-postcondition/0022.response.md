The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is not provided. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, and `col` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, and `col` has increased by 1.**
