The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, after execution, `comps[j]` will hold that positive integer value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col**
