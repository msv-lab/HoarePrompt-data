Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It calculates and counts the number of connected components in the permutation `p`. The function returns 0 if there is only one component; otherwise, it returns the count of components. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `b` is zero, it adds 1 to the result. **
