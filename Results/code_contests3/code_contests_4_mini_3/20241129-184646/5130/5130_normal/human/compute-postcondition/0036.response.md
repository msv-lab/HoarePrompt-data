According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Thus, after the update for the next iteration, `i` will be 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
