The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, meaning that `j` now takes on whatever value is found at the index `j` in the list `p`. The previous value of `j` is not specified, nor is the value of `p[j]`, but `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0 for the loop to execute again, indicating that `p[j]` is valid and refers to an index in `comps`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` has increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the current value of `col`; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
