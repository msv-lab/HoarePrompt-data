Output State: **`j` is the last value assigned by `p` during the loop iterations, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and since `comps[p[j]]` is no longer equal to 0, the loop terminates. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.**
