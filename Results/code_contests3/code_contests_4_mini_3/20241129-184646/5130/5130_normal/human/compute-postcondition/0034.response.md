Output State: **`j` is the value reached through the index mapping defined by `p`, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `comps` has been updated for all indices accessed via `p` until a non-zero value was encountered, `col` has increased by the number of iterations of the loop, and `n` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is still 1.**
