To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the condition of the `while` loop.

The loop condition `comps[p[j]] == 0` means that for the loop to execute, the element at index `p[j]` in the `comps` array must be equal to 0. 

Now, let's evaluate the state before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.
- `i` is 0.
- `comps[0]` is `col + 1`, and `col` is increased by 1, which means `comps[0]` is at least 2 (if `col` starts from 1).
- `j` is 0.

Given that `comps[0]` is `col + 1` and `col` has been incremented by 1, we can infer that `comps[p[j]]`, where `j` is 0, refers to `comps[p[0]]`. 

For the loop to execute, `comps[p[0]]` must be equal to 0. This means that we need to ensure that the value at `p[0]` does not point to an index that has a non-zero value in the `comps` array. Therefore, `p[0]` must be set to an index where `comps` holds a value of 0.

Since we do not have the specific values of `p` or `comps` provided, we suggest that `p[0]` needs to point to an index where `comps` is guaranteed to be 0.

Thus, the necessary adjustment can be stated as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[0]` is `col + 1`; `col` is increased by 1; `j` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `p[0]` must point to an index where `comps[p[0]] == 0`.**
