The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. The parameter `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`. 

The function returns a result based on the relationships between the elements of `p` and `b`. The specific output is determined by the values contained within these lists, which influence the final outcome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones, and returns a result based on the elements of these lists.**
