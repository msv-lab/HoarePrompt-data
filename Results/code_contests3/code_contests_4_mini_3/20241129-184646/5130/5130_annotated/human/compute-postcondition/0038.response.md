In this case, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The values of `i` and `col` have been affected as follows: `i` is `i_last + 2` and `col` has been increased by 1. Since `n` is an input positive integer and does not directly affect the assignment, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
