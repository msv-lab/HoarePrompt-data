The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is determined by the expression `i_last + 2`, which means `j` will take that same value. The values of `n`, `col`, and `comps[i]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is assigned the value of `i`.**
