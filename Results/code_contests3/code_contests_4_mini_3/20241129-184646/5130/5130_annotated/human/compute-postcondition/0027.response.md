The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` is previously assigned the value of `p[i_last + 1]`, and `comps[p[j]]` is initially 0. The state of other variables, including `n`, `i`, and `comps`, remains unaffected except for `comps[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is `p[i_last + 1]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is `p[i_last + 1]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
