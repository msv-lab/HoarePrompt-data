Output State: **`comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and this process continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer equal to 0. At the end, `col` is increased by the number of iterations executed, `n` remains the input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `i` is `i_last + 2`. The final value of `j` is such that `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero.**
