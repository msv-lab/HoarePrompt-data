According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_last + 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to `i_last + 1` and it must be less than `n`. 

Since `comps[i]` equals 0, the `comps` array will be updated with the value of `col` for all indices traced by `p` starting from `i_last + 1` until a non-zero value is encountered. 

Now, if `i` is currently `i_last + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i_last + 2`. Thus, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i_last + 2`.**
