According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. 

The state before the loop indicates that `n` is already a positive integer, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The loop variable `i` will be initialized to 0 before the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
