Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), if `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `j` is updated to `p[j]` repeatedly until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer equal to 0, at which point `col` is increased by the number of iterations executed, and the final value of `j` is such that `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero.***
