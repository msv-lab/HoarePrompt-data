The line of code initializes `comps` as a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of the variable `comps`, which is now a list of zeros of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of zeros of length `n`.**
