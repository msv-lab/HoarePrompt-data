`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, and `col` is increased by 1; `j` is 0. 
Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, `col` is increased by 1; `j` is 0**
