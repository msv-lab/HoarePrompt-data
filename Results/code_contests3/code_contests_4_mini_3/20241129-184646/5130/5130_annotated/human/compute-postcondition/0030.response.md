`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The values of `n`, `i`, `comps[p[j]]`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `comps[j]` is updated to `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col.**
