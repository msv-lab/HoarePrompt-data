According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, which means that `comps[p[j]]` must also be equal to 0 for the loop to execute. 

Since `i` is `i_last + 2`, and `col` is increased by 1, we need to ensure that `p[j]` is such that `comps[p[j]]` equals 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `p[j]` points to an index in `comps` where the value is 0.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 2`, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is assigned the value of `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0**
