`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has been increased by 1. Since `i` is 0, `comps[0]` will be assigned the value of `col`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.**
