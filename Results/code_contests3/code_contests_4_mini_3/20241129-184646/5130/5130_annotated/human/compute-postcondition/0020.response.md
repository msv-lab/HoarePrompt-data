Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `j` is the last index reached through the array `p` where `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `comps` contains `col` for all indices that were visited during the loop, and `col` is the final value incremented beyond its initial value.***
