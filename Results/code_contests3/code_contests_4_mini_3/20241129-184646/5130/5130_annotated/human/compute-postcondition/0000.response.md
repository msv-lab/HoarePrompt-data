The value of `n` is assigned from the input, which is converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, but the exact value is not specified. The other variables `p` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an integer based on the input received.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as p.**
