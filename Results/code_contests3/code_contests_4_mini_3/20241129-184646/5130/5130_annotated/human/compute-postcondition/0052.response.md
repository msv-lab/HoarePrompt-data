To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the components involved:

1. `col` is the total number of connected components found in `p`.
2. The code uses a conditional expression to evaluate `0 if col == 1 else col`, which will return `0` if `col` is `1` and return `col` otherwise.
3. Then, it adds `(1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)` to this result. This part checks if the sum of the list `b` is `0`, returning `1` if true, and `0` if false.

Thus, depending on the values of `col` and `b`, we derive the final output. 

- If `col` is `1`, the output will be `0 + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)`.
- If `col` is greater than `1`, the output will be `col + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)`.

Given that `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and does not directly affect the output, we focus on `col` and `b`.

The potential scenarios for the output will vary based on the values of `col` and the sum of `b`. However, since we have no specific values for `col` or `b`, we cannot compute a definitive numeric output. 

Therefore, we summarize the output state based on the conditions described:

Output State: **`col` is the total number of connected components found in `p`; the output is `0` if `col` is 1 plus `1` if sum(b) is 0, otherwise it is `col` plus `1` if sum(b) is 0.**
