The variable `p` is assigned a new list that is created by iterating over the input values provided by `raw_input()`, converting each value `v` to an integer, and then subtracting 1 from it. The initial state mentions that `p` represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, meaning the values of `p` will range from `0` to `n-1` after this transformation. The previous values of `p` are overwritten with the new values derived from the input. Other variables like `n` and `b` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as p.**
