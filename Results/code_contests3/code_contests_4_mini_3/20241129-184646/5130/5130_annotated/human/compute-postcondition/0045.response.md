In the initial state, `comps[i]` has been assigned the value of `col`, and now `comps[j]` is being assigned the value of `col` as well. The variables `n`, `i`, `col`, and `j` are affected by this code. The value of `col` is being used to update two different indices in the `comps` array: first at `i` and now at `j`.

Since `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, the state of `comps` at index `j` will reflect the same value as `comps[i]`, which is `col`. The previous values of `comps[i]` and `comps[j]` are not specified, but we know that `comps[j]` will now hold the value of `col`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `i` is `i_last + 2`; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is `col`; `comps[j]` is now `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `i` is `i_last + 2`; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is `col`; `comps[j]` is now `col`.**
