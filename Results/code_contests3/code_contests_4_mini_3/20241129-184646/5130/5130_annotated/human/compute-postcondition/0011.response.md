The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is 0, so now `j` takes the value of `p[0]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `comps[0]`, `col`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is now `p[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is now `p[0]**
