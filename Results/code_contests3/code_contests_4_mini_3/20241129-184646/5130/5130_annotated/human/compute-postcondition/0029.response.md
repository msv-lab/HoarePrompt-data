The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is given as `p[i_last + 1]`, which means `j` is updated to the value of `p[p[i_last + 1]]`. The values of other variables (`n`, `i`, `comps[p[j]]`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]**
