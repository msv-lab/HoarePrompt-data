The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which was previously increased by 1. Since `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`, we can conclude that `comps[p[j]]` must have been 0 before this assignment. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, but `comps[j]` now holds the value of `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `i` is `i_last + 2`; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `comps[p[j]]` must be 0; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `i` is `i_last + 2`; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `comps[p[j]]` must be 0; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
