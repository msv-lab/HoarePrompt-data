The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to \(n\). The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with the same length as `p`. 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return value or the conditions under which it is returned. However, the function's purpose can be inferred to involve processing the parameters in some manner related to their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones, and processes these inputs based on the defined constraints.**
