The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous state indicates that `comps[p[j]]` was 0, which means that prior to this assignment, `comps[j]` held a value that was not specified but is now being updated to `col`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now assigned the value `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`**.
