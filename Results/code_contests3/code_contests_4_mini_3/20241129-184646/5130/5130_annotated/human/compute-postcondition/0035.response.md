Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 1`, and if `comps[i]` equals 0, then `comps` contains `col` assigned to all indices traced by `p` starting from `i_last + 1` until a non-zero value is encountered, while `j` is the last index updated through `p` that led to a non-zero `comps[j]`.***
