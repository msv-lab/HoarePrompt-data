Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It calculates the number of connected components in the permutation represented by `p` and checks if the list `b` contains only zeros. It then prints `0` if there is only one connected component and `1` if the sum of `b` is zero, otherwise it prints the number of connected components.**
