According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is some value less than `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), this means that there is still a possibility for the loop to run again.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i_last`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be incremented by 1 to `i_last + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i_last + 1` must be less than `n`.

Thus, if `i` is currently `i_last`, we can infer that `n` must be greater than `i_last + 1`.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is `i_last + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i_last + 1`**
