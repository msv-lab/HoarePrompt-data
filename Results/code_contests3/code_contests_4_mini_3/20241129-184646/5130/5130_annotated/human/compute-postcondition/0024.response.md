The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is previously defined as `i_last + 1`, which means `j` now holds that value as well. The values of `n`, `col`, and `comps[i]` remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `col` is the increased value, `comps[i]` is assigned `col`, and `j` is `i_last + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `col` is the increased value, `comps[i]` is assigned `col`, `j` is `i_last + 1`**
