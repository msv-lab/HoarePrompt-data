The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is `i_last + 1`, so after execution, `j` will now hold the value of `p[i_last + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, and `j` is `p[i_last + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, and `j` is `p[i_last + 1]**
