The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones. It calculates the number of unique components in the permutation and checks if the sum of the list `b` is zero. The function returns 0 if there is only one component, otherwise it returns the number of components. Additionally, if the sum of `b` is zero, it adds 1 to the result. Thus, the output can be 0, the number of components, or the number of components plus 1 if the sum of `b` is zero.
