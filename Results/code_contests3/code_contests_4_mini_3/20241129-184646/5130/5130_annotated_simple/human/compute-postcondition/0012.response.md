`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` has been increased by 1, so `comps[j]` will now hold the value of this incremented `col`. The previous states of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `j`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `col` has been increased by 1, `j` is `p[0]`, and `comps[p[0]]` now equals `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `col` has been increased by 1, `j` is `p[0]`, and `comps[p[0]]` now equals `col.**
