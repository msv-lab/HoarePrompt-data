`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is increased by 1 before this assignment, `comps[i]` will take the value of the updated `col`. The current value of `i` is 0, and the initial value of `comps[i]` is 0, but that will be overwritten. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been increased by 1.**
