`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` was increased by 1 before this assignment, and `i` is 2. Therefore, the value of `comps[2]` will now be equal to the updated value of `col`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
