According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to n-1, meaning it will execute n times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
