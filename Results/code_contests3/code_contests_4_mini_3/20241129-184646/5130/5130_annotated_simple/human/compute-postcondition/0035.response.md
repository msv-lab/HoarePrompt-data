Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` equals 0, then `j` is the final value determined by repeatedly following the mapping in `p`, `col` is increased by the number of iterations the loop executed, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` while `comps` contains the values assigned during the iterations corresponding to the indices followed by `j`. If `comps[i]` is not 0, no changes occur to `comps` or `col`.***
