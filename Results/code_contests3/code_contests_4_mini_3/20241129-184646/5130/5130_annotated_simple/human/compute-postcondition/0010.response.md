To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one time, we need to analyze the condition of the loop: `comps[p[j]] == 0`. 

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer, which indicates that there are elements in the `comps` array.
   - `i` is 0, which does not directly affect the loop condition.
   - `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, meaning that the value at index 0 of the `comps` array is tied to the variable `col`.
   - `col` has been increased by 1, which implies that `comps[0]` (equal to the previous value of `col`) is now one less than the current value of `col`.
   - `j` is 0, which means that `p[j]` will access the first element of the `p` array.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Since `j` is 0, we are examining `comps[p[0]]`.
   - To ensure that the loop can execute, `comps[p[0]]` must currently be equal to 0.

3. **Necessary Adjustments:**
   - If `comps[p[0]]` is not currently 0, we need to ensure that it is set to 0 for the loop to execute. There is no information given about the values in `comps` or the contents of the `p` array, but we can infer that for the loop to execute, `comps[p[0]]` must be adjusted to be 0.

Based on this analysis, we need to state that `comps[p[0]]` must be equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been increased by 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[0]]` must be equal to 0**.
