According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2**
