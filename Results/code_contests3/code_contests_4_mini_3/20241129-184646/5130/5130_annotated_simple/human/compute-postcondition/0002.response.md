The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input in the form of a string, `split()` divides that string into a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer. The variable `p` remains unaffected, and the specifics of the input will determine the contents of `b`. However, since `b` is a map object, it will represent a collection of integers derived from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5); `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a map object containing integers derived from input.**
