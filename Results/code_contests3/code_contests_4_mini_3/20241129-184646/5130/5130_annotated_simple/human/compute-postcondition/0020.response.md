Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `comps` contains values equal to `col` for all indices accessed through the chain of `p` starting from the initial `j`, where `j` is the last value accessed through `p`, and `col` has been incremented for each unique index accessed until `comps[j]` was no longer equal to 0.***
