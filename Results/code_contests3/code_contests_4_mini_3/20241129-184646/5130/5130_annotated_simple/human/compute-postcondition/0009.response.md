`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `j` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been increased by 1, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been increased by 1, `j` is 0**
