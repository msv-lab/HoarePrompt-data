`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` is 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `col`, `comps[2]`) are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
