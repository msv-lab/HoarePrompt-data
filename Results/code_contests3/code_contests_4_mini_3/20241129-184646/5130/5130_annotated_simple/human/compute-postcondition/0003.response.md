The line `comps = [(0) for i in xrange(n)]` creates a list called `comps` where each element is initialized to `0`. The list will have a length equal to `n`, which is a positive integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `comps` is now a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a map object containing integers derived from input; `comps` is a list of zeros with length n.**
