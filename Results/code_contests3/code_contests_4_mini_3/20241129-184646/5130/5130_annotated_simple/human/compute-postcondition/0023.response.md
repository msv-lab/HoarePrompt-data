The code assigns the value of `col` to the `i`-th index of the `comps` list. The previous value of `col` is unknown, but it has been stated that `col` is increased by 1. The variable `i` is currently 1. Therefore, the value at index 1 of `comps` will be set to the current value of `col`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
