Output State: **`j` is the final value determined by repeatedly following the mapping in `p`, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by the number of iterations the loop executed, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `comps` contains the values assigned during the iterations corresponding to the indices followed by `j`.**
