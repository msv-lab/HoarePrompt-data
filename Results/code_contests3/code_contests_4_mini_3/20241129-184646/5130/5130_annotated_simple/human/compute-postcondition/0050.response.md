Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `col` is increased by the number of iterations, `comps[2]` is assigned the final value of `col`, and `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]` until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0, after which `comps[j]` is assigned the final value of `col`.***
