`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables, `n`, `col`, and `comps[1]`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 1**
