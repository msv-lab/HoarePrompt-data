The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200,000 (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`. The function processes these inputs to produce a result based on the specified logic. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
