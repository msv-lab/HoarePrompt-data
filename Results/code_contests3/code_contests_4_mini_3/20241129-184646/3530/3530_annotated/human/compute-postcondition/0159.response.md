Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from `0` to `2^n - 1`, `j` is in the range from `0` to `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on all valid combinations of `i`, `mask`, and `j` as per the conditions in the nested loops, reflecting the contributions from previous iterations and valid states of `dp`.**
