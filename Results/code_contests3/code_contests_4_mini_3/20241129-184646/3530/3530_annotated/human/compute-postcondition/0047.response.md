Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n`, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
