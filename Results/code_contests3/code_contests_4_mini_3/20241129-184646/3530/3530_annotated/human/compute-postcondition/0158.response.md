Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is less than `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the results of all updates based on the conditions applied for each `j` in the ranges specified, reflecting the contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`.**
