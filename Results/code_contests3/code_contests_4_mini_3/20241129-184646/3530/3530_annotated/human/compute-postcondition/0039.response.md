Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values from the preceding iterations. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD` with the updated accumulated value.***
