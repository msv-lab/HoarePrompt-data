The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` indicates that the value of `dp[i][mask]` is being increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`
- `mask` is 1
- `j` is 0
- The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1
- The bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, which is true since `mask` (1) AND (`1 << 0`, which is 1) is 1 (non-zero).

We can infer:
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` translates to `1 ^ 1`, which results in `0`.
- Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Since the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are not specified, we can state that `dp[i][1]` will increase by whatever value is currently in `dp[i - 1][0]`. 

Thus, regardless of their specific values, the impact of the operation results in updating `dp[i][1]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][0]`**
