Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.***
