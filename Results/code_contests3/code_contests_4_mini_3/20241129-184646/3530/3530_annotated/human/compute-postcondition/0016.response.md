`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. The current value of `i` is `2`, so `dp[0][2]` is set to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1**
