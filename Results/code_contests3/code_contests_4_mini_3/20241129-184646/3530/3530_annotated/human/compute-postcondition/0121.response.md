`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but it is affected by the modulo operation. The other variables `N`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD.**
