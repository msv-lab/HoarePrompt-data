Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n`, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then the modulo operation `dp[i][mask]` is executed without any change to the values of relevant variables.***
