According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. Therefore, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3.**
