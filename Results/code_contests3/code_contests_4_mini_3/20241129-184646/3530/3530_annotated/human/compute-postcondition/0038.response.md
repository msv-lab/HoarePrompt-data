The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The values of the other variables (`dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, `mask`, `j`, and `MOD`) do not change.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` now contains the updated accumulated value.**
