Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`; `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `n - 1` after the loop has executed; if for each `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the corresponding values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the final value modulo `MOD`.**
