According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `j` is less than the string-converted integer `n`. Given that `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **If `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2**
