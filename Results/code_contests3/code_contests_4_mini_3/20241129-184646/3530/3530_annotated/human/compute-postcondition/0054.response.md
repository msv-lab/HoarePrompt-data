Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of its current value with respect to `MOD`.***
