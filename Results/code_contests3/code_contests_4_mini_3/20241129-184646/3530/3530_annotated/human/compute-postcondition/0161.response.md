The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on a predefined 2D list `a` representing compatibility between individuals. The list `a` is of dimensions N x N, where `N` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint 1 <= N <= 21. Each element of the list `a[i][j]` indicates the compatibility between Man i+1 and Woman j+1, with values either 0 or 1. The function processes this 2D list and returns a result based on the compatibility information it contains.

Functionality: **The function operates on a 2D list of integers representing compatibility between men and women and returns a result based on the compatibility data.**
