The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is not provided, but the operation does not affect the values of other variables. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the modulus operation, but without knowing the specific values, we can only state that it is now the remainder when divided by `MOD`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.**
