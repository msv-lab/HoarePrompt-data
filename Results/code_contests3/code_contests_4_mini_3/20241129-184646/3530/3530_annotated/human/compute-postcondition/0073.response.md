The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

1. `dp[i][mask]` is modified, but the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the specific numerical change.
2. `mask` and `j` are both known: `mask` is 1 and `j` is 1. The expression `1 << j` evaluates to `2` (since `1 << 1` shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by one position, which gives `2`).
3. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `1 ^ 2`, which results in `3` (the binary XOR operation between `1` and `2`).

Since the exact current values of `dp` are not specified, we can only express the change in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it.**
