According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2. Thus, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1**
