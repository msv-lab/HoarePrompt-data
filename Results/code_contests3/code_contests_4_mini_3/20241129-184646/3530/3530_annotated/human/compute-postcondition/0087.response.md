According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the next values are `j` is increased by 1, making it 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2**
