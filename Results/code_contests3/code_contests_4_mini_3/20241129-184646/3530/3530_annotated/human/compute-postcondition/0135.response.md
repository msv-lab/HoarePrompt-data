The code snippet `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `mask` is manipulated using the bitwise XOR operation with the expression `1 << j`, which represents a bitwise shift left operation that sets the j-th bit in the mask.

In this context, `dp` is a two-dimensional list (table) where `i` is the current index and `mask` represents a combination of states that can be encoded in binary. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value from the previous index `i - 1` at a modified state represented by `mask ^ 1 << j`.

Since the values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not specified, we cannot compute specific numeric outputs. However, we can state the operation as an update to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.**
