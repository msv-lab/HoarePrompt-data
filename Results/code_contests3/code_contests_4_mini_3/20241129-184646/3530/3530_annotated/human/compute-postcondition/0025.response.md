According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `n` is convertible to an integer and is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
