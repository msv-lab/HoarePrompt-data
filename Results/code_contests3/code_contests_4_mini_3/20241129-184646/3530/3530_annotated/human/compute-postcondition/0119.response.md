According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, since `n` represents the upper limit of the range and must allow for at least two iterations (0 and 1).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
