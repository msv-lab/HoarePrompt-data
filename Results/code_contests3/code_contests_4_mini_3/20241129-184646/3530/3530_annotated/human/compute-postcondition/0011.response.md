According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `n`, which is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0. The expression `1 << n` results in `2^n`, which determines the range of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, ensuring that `1 << n` is at least 1.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 0, which is the first value in the range from 0 to `2^n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
