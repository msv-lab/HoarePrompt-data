The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Let's analyze the initial state:
- `mask` is 2 (which in binary is `10`).
- `j` is 1.
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the bitwise XOR of `mask` and `1 << j`. Here, `1 << j` is `1 << 1`, which equals `2` (or `10` in binary). Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` results in `2 ^ 2`, which is `0` (or `00` in binary).
- The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, but it does not directly affect the operation here.

The value of `dp[i - 1][0]` will be added to `dp[i][2]`. The exact numeric values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not defined in the initial state, but we can state that `dp[i][2]` is increased by whatever value `dp[i - 1][0]` holds.

Since we don't have specific values for `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, we can summarize the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][0]`**.
