According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range defined by `n`, which is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, we can conclude that the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2**
