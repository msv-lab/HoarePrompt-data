Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `mask + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
