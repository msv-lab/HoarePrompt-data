Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `mask + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
