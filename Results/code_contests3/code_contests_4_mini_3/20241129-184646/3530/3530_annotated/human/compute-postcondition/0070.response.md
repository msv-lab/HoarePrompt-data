The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is affected by the modulo operation. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, while the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unspecified.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, while the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unspecified.**
