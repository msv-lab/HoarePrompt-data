According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the string `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1**
