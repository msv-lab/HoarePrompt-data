Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the valid conditions checked throughout all iterations of the loop, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the value of `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., mask & (1 << j) is true).***
