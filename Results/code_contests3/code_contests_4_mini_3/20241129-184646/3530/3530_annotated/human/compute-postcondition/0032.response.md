Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with a modulo operation. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
