The code appends a new list of integers to `a` by mapping the input values converted to integers from `raw_input()`. The values of `N` and `current_iteration` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `N` is a positive integer and `current_iteration` is `k + 1`, the loop will continue to execute as long as `N` is greater than `current_iteration`. The specifics of the input will determine the new values appended to `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `current_iteration` is `k + 1`; `a` now contains additional integers from input.**
