According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the current iteration is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and `current_iteration` remains the same. This means that if `current_iteration` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `current_iteration` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, after the last iteration, if `current_iteration` is `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `current_iteration` must be `k + 1`, and `N` must still be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `current_iteration` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than `k + 1`**
