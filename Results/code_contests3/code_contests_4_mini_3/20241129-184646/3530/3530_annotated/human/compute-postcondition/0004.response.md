The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` appends a new list to the 2D list `a`. The `raw_input()` function takes a line of input as a string, `split()` breaks it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string in that list to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer and `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, the input will provide valid integers to be added to `a`. The previous state of `a` is an empty 2D list.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with a new row of integers added from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0**.
