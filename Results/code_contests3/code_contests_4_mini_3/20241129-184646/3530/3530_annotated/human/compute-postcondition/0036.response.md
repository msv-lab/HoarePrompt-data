Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n - 1` (where `n` is at least 1), `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values from the preceding iterations, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero.***
