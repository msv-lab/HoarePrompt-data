Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is now 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.***
