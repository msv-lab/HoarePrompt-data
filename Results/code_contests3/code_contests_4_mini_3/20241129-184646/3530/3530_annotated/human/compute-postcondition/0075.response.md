Postcondition: ***If `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation when `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set. There is no else part in the code.***
