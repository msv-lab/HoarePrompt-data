Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 2, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and is taken modulo `MOD`.***
