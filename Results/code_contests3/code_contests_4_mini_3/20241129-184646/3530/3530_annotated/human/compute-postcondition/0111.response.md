Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is `2^n - 1`, `j` is less than `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` for all values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
