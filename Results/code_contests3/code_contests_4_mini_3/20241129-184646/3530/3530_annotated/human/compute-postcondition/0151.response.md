The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is now modified, but the actual values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated with its previous value modulo `MOD`. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
