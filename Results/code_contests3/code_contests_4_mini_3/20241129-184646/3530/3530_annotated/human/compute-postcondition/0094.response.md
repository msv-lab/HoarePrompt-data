Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 3, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (bitwise shift left of 1 by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.***
