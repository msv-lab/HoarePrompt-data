The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the result of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected, and the previous values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
