The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `i` is 0, so `dp[0][0]` is set to `1`. The other variables (`N`, `n`, etc.) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is 1**.
