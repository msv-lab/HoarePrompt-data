The variable `dp` is assigned a list comprehension that creates a 2D list. The inner list `([0] * (1 << n))` generates a list of zeroes with a length of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \( 2^n \). The outer list comprehension iterates `n + 1` times, resulting in `dp` being a list containing `n + 1` lists, each with a size of \( 2^n \). The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a 2D list with `n` rows of integers added from input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0; `dp` is a list of size `(n + 1) x (2^n)` initialized with zeroes.**
