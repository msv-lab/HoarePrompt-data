Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values from the preceding iterations, updated based on the conditions checked within the loop.**
