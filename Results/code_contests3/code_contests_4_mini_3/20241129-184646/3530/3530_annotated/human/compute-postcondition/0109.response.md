Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 3, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no operation is performed on `dp[i][mask]`.***
