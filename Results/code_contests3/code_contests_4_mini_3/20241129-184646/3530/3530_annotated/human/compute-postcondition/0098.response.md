Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is now 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.***
