To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the impact of the operation on the variables involved.

1. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is being updated by adding a value to it.
2. The value being added is `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
3. The `mask` variable has a value of 3.
4. The `j` variable has a value of 2.
5. The operation `1 << j` computes to `1 << 2`, which is `4` (or `00000100` in binary).
6. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` becomes `3 ^ 4`, which results in `7` (or `00000111` in binary).
7. The final update will depend on the current values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1]`.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1]`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the change in terms of the variables.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][7]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is at least 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][7]`.**
