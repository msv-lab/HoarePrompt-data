`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `dp[0][i]` is not mentioned, but since `dp[0][0]` is 1 and `i` is 1, we are now updating `dp[0][1]` to also be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
