Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `mask + 1`. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, reflecting the contributions from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where applicable, and taken modulo `MOD`.**
