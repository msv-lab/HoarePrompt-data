Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with a value modulo `MOD`; otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
