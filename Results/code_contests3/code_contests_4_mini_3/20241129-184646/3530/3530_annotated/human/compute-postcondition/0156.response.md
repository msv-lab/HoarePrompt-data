Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `mask + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
