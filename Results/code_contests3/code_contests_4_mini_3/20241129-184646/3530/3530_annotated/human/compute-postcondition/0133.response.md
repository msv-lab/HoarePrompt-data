Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`; `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
