The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a 2D list `a` of dimensions N x N, where each element indicates the compatibility between men and women. It calculates the number of valid pairings based on the compatibility data and prints the result modulo 1000000007. The function assumes valid input but does not handle cases where `N` is outside the specified range or invalid input types.
