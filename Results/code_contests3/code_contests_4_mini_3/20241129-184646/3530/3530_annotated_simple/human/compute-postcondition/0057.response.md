`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying a modulo operation with `MOD`. However, the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` before the operation is not provided, so we can't determine the exact new value after the operation. The other variables, `N`, `mask`, and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 3; `j` is 1; and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 3; `j` is 1; and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation.**
