According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `2^N` (which is `1 << N`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. The loop can continue executing as long as `i` is less than `2^N`, which is `1 << N`. Given that `N` is at least 1, `1 << N` will be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `dp[0]` is a list where the first element becomes 1, and the rest are 0s; `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 2^N.**
