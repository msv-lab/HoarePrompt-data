`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The variable `N` is not directly affected, and neither are `mask` or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated and now equals `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
