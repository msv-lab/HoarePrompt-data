According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `N` is given as a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, we can infer that `n` must also be defined in relation to `N`. It's common in loop contexts that `n` could be equal to `N` or a similar positive integer within that range to ensure the loop runs.

The loop runs a number of times equal to `n`, starting from `j = 0`. Given that `j` is initialized to `N-1`, this indicates that `j` will take on values in the range from `0` to `n-1` during the loop's execution. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1 (to allow for the first iteration) and that `j` starts at 0, which is the typical starting point for a loop.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
- `j` should start at 0 for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
