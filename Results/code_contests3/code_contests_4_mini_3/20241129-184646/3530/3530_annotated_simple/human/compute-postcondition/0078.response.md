The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and computing the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is directly affected by this operation, but the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state. Other variables (`N`, `mask`, `j`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][5]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of its previous value divided by `MOD`.**
