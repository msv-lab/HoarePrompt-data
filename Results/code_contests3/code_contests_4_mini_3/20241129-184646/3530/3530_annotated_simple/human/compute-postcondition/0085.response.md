The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The specific values are `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, which gives `mask ^ 1 << j` as `2 ^ 1` which equals `3`. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, meaning that `dp[i][mask]` is now influenced by `dp[i - 1][3]`.

Following this, the line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][3]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, where `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][3]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, where `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.**
