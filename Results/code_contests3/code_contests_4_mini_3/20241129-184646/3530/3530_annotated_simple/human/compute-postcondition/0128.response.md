According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `mask`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `1 << n` (which is `2^n`). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is such that it is at least `1` and less than `2^n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented.

Currently, `mask` is less than `2^n`, so we can simply add `1` to `mask` for the next iteration. This means that in the next iteration, `mask` will be equal to the current `mask + 1`. 

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will reflect that the value of `mask` is updated accordingly, and we must ensure that it remains within the correct bounds.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time `mask` must be less than `2^N`; `j` is at least 0 and less than `n`.**
