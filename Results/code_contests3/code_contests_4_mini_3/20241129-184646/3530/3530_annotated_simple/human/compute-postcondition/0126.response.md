Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1`, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
