The code snippet modifies the `dp` array based on previous values. The value of `mask` is currently 3 and `j` is 2. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates to `mask ^ 4`, which results in `3 ^ 4 = 7`. The value at `dp[i - 1][7]` is added to `dp[i][mask]`. 

The values of `N`, `mask`, and `j` are not changed, but the computation affects the `dp` array. The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - 1]` are unknown, therefore we cannot provide exact numbers for the output state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][7]`.**
