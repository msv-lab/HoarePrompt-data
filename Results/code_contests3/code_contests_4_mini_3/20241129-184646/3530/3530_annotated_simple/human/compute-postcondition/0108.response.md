The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `mask` is 3 and `j` is 3, we first calculate the expression `mask ^ 1 << j`. The operation `1 << j` shifts 1 to the left by 3 positions, resulting in the value 8. Then, performing the XOR operation `3 ^ 8` gives us 11. 

Now, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][11]` to it. After this addition, the next line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, but since `MOD` is not specified in the initial state, we can only acknowledge that it is applied.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][11]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][11]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`**.
