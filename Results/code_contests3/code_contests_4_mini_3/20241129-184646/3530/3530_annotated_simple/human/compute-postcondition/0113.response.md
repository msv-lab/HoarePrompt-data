According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, resulting in a range that includes at least the number 1. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and `mask` is calculated as `2^N - 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is set appropriately. The variable `i` is given as `n + 1`, meaning that for the loop to execute, `n` must be defined such that it allows `mask` to take on valid values.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
1. `n` should be at least 1 (ensuring that the range includes at least the number 1).
2. `i` should be initialized to `n + 1`, but since it's stated to be `n + 1 for the loop to execute one more time`, it implies it can be adjusted to reflect the loop's execution.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 1`**
