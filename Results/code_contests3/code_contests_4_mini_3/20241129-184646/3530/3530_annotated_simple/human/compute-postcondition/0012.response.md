`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The current value of `dp[0]` is a list containing `1 << N` (2^N) zeros. Since `i` is 0, we are updating the first element of the first sublist of `dp` to 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `dp[0]` is a list where the first element becomes 1, and the rest are 0s; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `dp[0]` is a list where the first element becomes 1, and the rest are 0s; `i` is 0.**
