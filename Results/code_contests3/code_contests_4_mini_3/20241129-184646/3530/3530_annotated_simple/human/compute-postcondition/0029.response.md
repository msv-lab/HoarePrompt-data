According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for the next value of `j` as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `mask` is 1, we need to determine the next state. If `j` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1`, the loop cannot execute again. However, if `j` is less than `n - 1`, it can execute again. 

Assuming `j` is currently less than `n - 1`, we increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` would be `j + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
