According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `N`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `N` must be greater than 3**.
