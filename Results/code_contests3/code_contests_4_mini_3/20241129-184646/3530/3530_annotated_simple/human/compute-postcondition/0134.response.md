According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 after this iteration.

Additionally, `N` and `mask` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The only condition that needs to hold true for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than `j`, which after the increment will be `1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
