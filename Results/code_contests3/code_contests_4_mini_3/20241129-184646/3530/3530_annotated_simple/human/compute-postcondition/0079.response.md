Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][5]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of its previous value divided by `MOD`.***
