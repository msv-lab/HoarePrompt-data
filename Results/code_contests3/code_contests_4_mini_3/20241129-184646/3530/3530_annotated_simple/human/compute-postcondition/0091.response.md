According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state will reflect that `j` is now 2, and since `N` is still a positive integer within the specified range, it remains valid.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
