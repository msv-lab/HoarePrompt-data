According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `j` will become 1. Additionally, `n` must remain greater than `j` for the loop to continue. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
