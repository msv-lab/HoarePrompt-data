The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is assigned the remainder of the division of its current value by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by this operation, while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD**
