The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]`. The `mask` has a value of 2, so the operation affects `dp[i][2]`. The previous value of `dp[i][2]` is not specified, but it is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The values of `N`, `j`, and `dp[i - 1][0]` remain unchanged, as the operation does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is 1; `dp[i][2]` has been updated by taking `dp[i][2] %= MOD`.**
