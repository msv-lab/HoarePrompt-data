The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `mask` is currently 1, and `j` is 2, so we need to calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`. 

Here, `1 << j` is `1 << 2`, which is `4` (binary `100`). Thus, `mask ^ 1 << j` is `1 ^ 4`, which results in `5` (binary `101`). 

Since the exact values of `dp` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise new value of `dp[i][mask]`, but we know it will be updated based on this calculation. Other variables (`N`, `j`, etc.) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][5]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][5]**.
