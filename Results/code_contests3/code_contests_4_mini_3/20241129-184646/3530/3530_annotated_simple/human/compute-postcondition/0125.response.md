The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`. This operation means that `dp[i][mask]` is assigned the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`, effectively ensuring that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds of `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified, but we know that the operation modifies `dp[i][mask]` based on its prior value.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**.
