According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Since `n` is at least 3, it remains valid for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `j` is 2.**
