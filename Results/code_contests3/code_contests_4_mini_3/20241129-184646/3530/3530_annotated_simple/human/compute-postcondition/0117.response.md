The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` takes the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and assigns it the remainder when divided by `MOD`. This operation effectively ensures that `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is being modified by this operation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is `2^N - 1; j` is 0; `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1; `mask` bitwise AND 1 left shifted by `j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
