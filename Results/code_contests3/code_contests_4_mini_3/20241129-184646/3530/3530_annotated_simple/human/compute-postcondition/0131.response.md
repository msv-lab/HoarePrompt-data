The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, which involves a bitwise XOR operation between `mask` and `1 << j`. 

Since `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, it is a positive integer and the bitwise operation will yield a valid index for `dp`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` will be retained, and the new value will reflect the addition of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the condition that `mask` AND `1 << j` is non-zero, it ensures that the operation is valid.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.**
