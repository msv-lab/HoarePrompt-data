The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it will now hold its value modulo `MOD`. The states of other variables (`N`, `mask`, `j`, and the updated value of `dp[i - 1][6]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of its previous value when divided by `MOD`.**
