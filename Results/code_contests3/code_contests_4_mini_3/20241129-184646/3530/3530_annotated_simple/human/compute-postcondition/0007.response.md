According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute again if the current iteration count (represented by `_`) is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. For the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count must be less than `N`. 

Since `N` is at least 1 and at most 21, if the loop has executed `N-1` times, it can execute once more. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if the loop has executed `N-1` times, `_` must be `N-1`, and for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must become `N`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be `N`**
