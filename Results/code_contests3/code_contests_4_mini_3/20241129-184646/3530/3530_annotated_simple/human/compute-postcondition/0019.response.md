According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1` because `1 << n` must yield a value greater than `1`, allowing the loop to iterate. Additionally, `mask` will take on the value of `1` in the first iteration.

Since `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, the conditions for the loop to execute are already satisfied with `N` being at least `1`, and `mask` starts at `1` for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1**
