The code snippet updates the `dp` array at position `[i][mask]` by adding the value from the previous row at position `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The current state indicates that `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and the bitwise operation `mask ^ 1 << j` will be calculated as follows:

1. `1 << j` is `1 << 1`, which equals `2` (binary `10`).
2. `mask ^ 1 << j` becomes `2 ^ 2`, which equals `0` (binary `00`).

Thus, the code effectively adds the value from `dp[i - 1][0]` to `dp[i][2]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `mask` is 2,
- `j` is 1,
- `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][0]`.

The output state, summarizing the changes made, is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]**
