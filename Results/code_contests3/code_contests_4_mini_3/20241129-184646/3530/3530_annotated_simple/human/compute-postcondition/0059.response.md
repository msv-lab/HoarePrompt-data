According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
