The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into separate values, converts each of them to an integer, and appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. However, since `N` is a positive integer and is defined to be between 1 and 21, and the fact that the loop needs to execute one more time, this indicates that the input is expected to be provided for `N` iterations.

The previous state of `a` is unknown, but it will be modified to include a new list of integers from the input. The output state reflects that `a` has been updated but does not specify the contents of the new input since they are user-defined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is updated to include a new list of integers from input**.
