The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits that input into individual components, converts those components into integers, and appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `a` is initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `a` will contain a map object of integers based on the input entered by the user.

However, since the exact input is not provided, we cannot determine the specific integers that will be appended to `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is no longer empty and now contains new elements based on user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains a map object of integers based on user input, `MOD` is 1000000007**.
