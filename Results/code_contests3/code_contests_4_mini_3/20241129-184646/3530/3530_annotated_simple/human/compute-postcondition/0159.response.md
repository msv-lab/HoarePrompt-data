Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` ranges from 1 to `2^N - 1`; `dp[N][mask]` contains the cumulative results of valid transitions based on the conditions checked for all `j` in the range `N`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on all values of `i` from 1 to `N`, with `dp[i][mask]` representing the total number of valid configurations considering all conditions defined by the adjacency matrix `a`.**
