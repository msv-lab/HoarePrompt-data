According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `mask`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be updated to the next value, which is 2. Since `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is at least 2 (in which case, `mask` can take values up to `2^n - 1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `mask` must be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `mask` must be less than 2^N**
