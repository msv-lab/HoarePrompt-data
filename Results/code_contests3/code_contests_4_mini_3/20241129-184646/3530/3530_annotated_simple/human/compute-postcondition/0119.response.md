According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

Since `j` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is `2^N - 1`; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
