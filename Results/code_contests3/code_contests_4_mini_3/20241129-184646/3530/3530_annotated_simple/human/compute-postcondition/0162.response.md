Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0 or 1) that represent the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It calculates the number of valid pairings based on this compatibility matrix using dynamic programming and outputs the total number of valid configurations where each man is paired with exactly one woman, considering all compatibility constraints. The result is computed modulo 1000000007. **
