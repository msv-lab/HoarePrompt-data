The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `N`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp[i][mask]`, but the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are unknown. Therefore, the output state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is modified by the modulo operation. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`.**
