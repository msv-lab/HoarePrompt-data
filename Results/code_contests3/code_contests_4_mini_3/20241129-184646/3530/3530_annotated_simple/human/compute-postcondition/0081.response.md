According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` values from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive). The current state indicates that `mask` is 1, which means the loop has just executed for the first time. The next value of `mask` will be 2.

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), `mask` is 1, and `j` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be 2, and it will continue to follow the range specified by the loop (from 1 to \(2^n - 1\)).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 2; `j` is `n-1`; `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the conditions checked for all `j` values from 0 to `n-1`.**
