The code initializes `a` as an empty list. This affects the variable `a` directly, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.**
