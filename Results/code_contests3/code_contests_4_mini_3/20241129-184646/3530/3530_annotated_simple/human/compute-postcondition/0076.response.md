According to the provided code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j`, which is currently 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
