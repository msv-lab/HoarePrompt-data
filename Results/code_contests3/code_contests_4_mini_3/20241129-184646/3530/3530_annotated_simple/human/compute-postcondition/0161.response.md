The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. The parameter `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 21 \). The parameter `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element \( a[i][j] \) is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between Man \( i \) and Woman \( j \). 

The function's output is determined by the compatibility data in the 2D list. Specifically, it processes this compatibility data to produce a result based on the relationships defined by the values in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between men and women, and returns a result based on the compatibility information in the list.**
