According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 2. 

Additionally, since `mask` is defined as `2^N - 1`, it will remain unchanged as it does not depend on `j`. The variable `N` is still a positive integer in the range from 1 to 21, and `mask` will remain the same as it is derived from `N`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the next time, `j` should be 2, and the condition must still hold that `1 <= j < n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
