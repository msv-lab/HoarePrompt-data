According to the code, the loop is set to execute from `i = 1` to `i = n`, inclusive. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, at the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Since the loop iterates `i` from 1 to `n`, if the loop has just executed with `i` as the current value, we need to prepare for the next iteration where `i` will be incremented by 1. If the last executed value of `i` was `n`, the loop will not execute again. If `i` was less than `n`, it will increment `i` and check the next value.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`, and in the next iteration `i` will be `i + 1`.**
