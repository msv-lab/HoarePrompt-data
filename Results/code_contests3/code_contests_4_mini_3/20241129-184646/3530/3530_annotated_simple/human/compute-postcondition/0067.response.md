According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The current state indicates that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 21, and we need to ensure that `n` is also at least 1.

Since we are not given the specific value of `n`, we need to confirm that `n` is set to a value that meets the condition for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `j` is the loop variable, it should start from 0 for the first iteration.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, we will set `n` to a value of at least 1, and `j` will start at 0 for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
