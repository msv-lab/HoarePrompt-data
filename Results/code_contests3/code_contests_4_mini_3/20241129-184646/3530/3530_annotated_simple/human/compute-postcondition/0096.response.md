According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mask`. The loop will execute for the next value of `mask` as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `mask` should be increased to 3. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), there is no constraint on `n` preventing the loop from continuing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `mask` must be less than 1 << `n` (which is 2^`n`)**
