According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is set to a value that allows `1 << n` (or 2^n) to be at least 1, which it always will be since `N` is a positive integer and `1 <= N <= 21`. 

At the start of the loop, the index `i` will begin at 0 and increment up to (but not including) `1 << n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` lists, each containing `1 << N` (2^N) zeros, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
