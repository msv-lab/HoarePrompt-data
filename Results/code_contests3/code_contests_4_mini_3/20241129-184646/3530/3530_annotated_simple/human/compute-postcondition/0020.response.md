According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `N` is already a positive integer within the range of 1 to 21, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mask` is specified to be 1 for the first execution of the loop. Therefore, the state can be described as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
