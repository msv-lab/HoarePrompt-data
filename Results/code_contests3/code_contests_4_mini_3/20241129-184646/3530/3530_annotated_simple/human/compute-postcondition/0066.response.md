According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current state of `mask`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (i.e., from 1 to \(1 << n - 1\)). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, and the initial value of `mask` should be 1.

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\) and the loop will run as long as `mask` is less than \(2^n\), we can specify that `mask` starts at 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute at least once `n` must be at least 1**
