According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

So, `j` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 since `j` has to be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` < `n`, `mask` is `2^N + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
