`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, and `j` is 2, which means `1 << j` equals `4`. The operation `mask ^ 4` modifies the `mask` value based on the XOR operation. The previous states of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`**
