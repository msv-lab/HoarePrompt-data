Postcondition: ***If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << j evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`. `N` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `n` is at least 3, and `j` is 2. If the condition is false, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
