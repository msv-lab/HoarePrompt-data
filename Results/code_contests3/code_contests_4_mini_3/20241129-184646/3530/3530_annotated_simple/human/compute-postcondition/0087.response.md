According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, which implies that `n` can be at least 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
