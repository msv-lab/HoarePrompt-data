According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
