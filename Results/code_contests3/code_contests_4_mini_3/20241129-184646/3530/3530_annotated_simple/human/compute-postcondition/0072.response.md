According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` must also be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
