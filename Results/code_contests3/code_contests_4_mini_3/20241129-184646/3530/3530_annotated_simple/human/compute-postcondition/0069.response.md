Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is 1; for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1; `j` is 0; the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1; and `mask` is such that the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
