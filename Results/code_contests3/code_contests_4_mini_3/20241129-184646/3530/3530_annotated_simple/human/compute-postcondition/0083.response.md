Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the conditions checked for all `j` values from 0 to `n-1`. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true (i.e., `mask` includes the j-th bit).***
