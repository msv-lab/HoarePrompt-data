Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` is bitwise ANDed with `1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
