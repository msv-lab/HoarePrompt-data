Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `mask` is `2^N - 1`; `j` is at least 0 and less than `n`; after all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions checked for each `j` in the range of `n`, and its final value will depend on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` and the calculations involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for the valid indices where the conditions are met.**
