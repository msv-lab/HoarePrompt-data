According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `j`, which is currently 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
