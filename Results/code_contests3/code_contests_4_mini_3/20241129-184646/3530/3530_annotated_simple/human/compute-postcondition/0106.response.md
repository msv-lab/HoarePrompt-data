According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 3. 

State: **`N` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 3.**
