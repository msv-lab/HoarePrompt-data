Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `mask` is `2^N - 1 + 1`, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
