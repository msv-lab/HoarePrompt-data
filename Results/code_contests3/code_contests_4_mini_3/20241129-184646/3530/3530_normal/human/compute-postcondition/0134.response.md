According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3, meaning the loop can execute again. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be at least 2 (which it is, since `n` is at least 3).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
