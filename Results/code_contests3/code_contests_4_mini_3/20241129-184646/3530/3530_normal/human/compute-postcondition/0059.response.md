According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 0, we know that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to iterate one more time. 

Thus, the updated state will reflect that `j` is now 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2**
