According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and the condition that `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 2. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop can still execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2**
