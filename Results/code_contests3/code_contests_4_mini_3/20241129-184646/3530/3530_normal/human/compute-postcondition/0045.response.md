The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variables involved are `i`, `mask`, and `j`. 

Given that:
- `i` is 1,
- `mask` is 2,
- `j` is 2,

First, we calculate `1 << j`, which is `1 << 2`, resulting in `4`. Then, we compute `mask ^ 1 << j`, which translates to `2 ^ 4`. The XOR operation between `2` (binary `10`) and `4` (binary `100`) results in `6` (binary `110`).

The code is trying to update `dp[1][2]` with the value from `dp[0][6]`. However, since there is no information about the values in the `dp` array, we cannot determine the exact new value.

Thus, we can state that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but without specific values provided, we cannot specify the exact changes in `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2.**
