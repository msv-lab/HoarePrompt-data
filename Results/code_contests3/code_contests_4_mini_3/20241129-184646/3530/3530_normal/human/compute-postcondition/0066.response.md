According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to \(2^n - 1\). The conditions specify that `mask` is already in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), which means the loop will execute at least once. 

The variable `i` is set to 2, which does not directly impact the execution of the loop but indicates the current state in a potential multi-step process. The variable `N` is provided, but it does not affect the execution of the loop in this context.

Thus, the necessary states reflecting the conditions before the loop starts are as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\)**
