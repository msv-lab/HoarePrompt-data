Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is equal to `n`, and the loop will not execute again as `j` is not less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[2][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation while maintaining its value within the range of `MOD`, and all other variables remain unchanged.***
