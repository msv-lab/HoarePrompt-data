Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
