Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` is the final value after all updates based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true (indicating that the j-th bit of mask is set).***
