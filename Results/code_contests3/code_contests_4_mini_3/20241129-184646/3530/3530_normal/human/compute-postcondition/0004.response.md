The line of code appends a new row to the 2D list `a`. The new row is created by taking an input string, splitting it into components, and mapping each component to an integer. Since `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, the input will consist of `N` integers.

The previous state of `a` is an empty 2D list, and since the input will create a new row of integers, the state of `a` after executing the code will contain one list of integers based on the provided input.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` now contains one row with integers parsed from the input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with one row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 0**
