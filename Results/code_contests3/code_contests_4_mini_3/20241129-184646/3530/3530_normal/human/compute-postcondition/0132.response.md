The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i = 3` and `mask = 2`. 

As a result, `dp[3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[3][2] % MOD`. The values of `N`, `n`, `j`, and other `dp` entries are not affected in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0; `dp[3][2]` is updated to `dp[3][2] % MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0; `dp[3][2]` is updated to `dp[3][2] % MOD**
