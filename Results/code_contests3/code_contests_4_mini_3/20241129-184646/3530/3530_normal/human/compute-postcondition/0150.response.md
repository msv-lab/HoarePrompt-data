To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables. 

1. The snippet `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
2. The initial values are given: `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1. We need to calculate `mask ^ 1 << j` as part of the update.
3. The operation `1 << j` shifts the number 1 to the left by `j` positions (1 position in this case), resulting in `2`. Therefore, `1 << 1` equals `2`.
4. Next, we perform the bitwise XOR: `mask ^ 2` where `mask` is `3` (which is `11` in binary) and `2` (which is `10` in binary).
   - Performing the XOR gives: `11 XOR 10 = 01`, which is `1` in decimal.
5. The code updates `dp[3][3]` by adding the value from `dp[2][1]` to it.

Since we do not have specific values for `dp[3][3]` or `dp[2][1]`, we cannot provide exact numerical outputs but we can indicate that `dp[3][3]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[2][1]`.

Output State: **`dp[3][3]` is updated based on the value of `dp[2][1]`.**
