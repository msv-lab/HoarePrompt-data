The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified, but the previous value is not specified. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
