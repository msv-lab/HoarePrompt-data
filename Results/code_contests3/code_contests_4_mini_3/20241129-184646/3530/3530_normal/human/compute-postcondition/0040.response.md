According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1.**
