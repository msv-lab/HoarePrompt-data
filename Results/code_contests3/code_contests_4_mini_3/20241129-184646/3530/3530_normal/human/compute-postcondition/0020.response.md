According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The starting value of `i` is set to 1, which is appropriate as it does not affect the loop execution directly. The variable `mask` is specified to be 1 for the loop to execute the first time, which is the desired state.

Therefore, the only conditions that need to be confirmed for the loop to execute are that `n` must be at least 1 and `mask` must be set to 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
