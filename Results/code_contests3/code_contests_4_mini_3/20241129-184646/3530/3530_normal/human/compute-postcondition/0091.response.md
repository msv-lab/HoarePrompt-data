According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. The loop can execute again if `n` is at least 3, as `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` is 2**
