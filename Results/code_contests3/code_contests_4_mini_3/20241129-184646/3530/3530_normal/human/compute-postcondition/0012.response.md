`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `dp[0][0]` is 1. The state of other variables (`N`, `n`, and `i`) remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is 1**.
