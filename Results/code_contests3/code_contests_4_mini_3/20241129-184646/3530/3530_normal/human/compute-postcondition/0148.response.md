Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` ANDed with `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `dp[3][3] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[3][3]` remains unchanged.***
