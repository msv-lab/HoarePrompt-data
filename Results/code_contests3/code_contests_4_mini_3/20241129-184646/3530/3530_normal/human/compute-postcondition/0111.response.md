Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the conditions evaluated for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, considering all valid states for the given `mask`.**
