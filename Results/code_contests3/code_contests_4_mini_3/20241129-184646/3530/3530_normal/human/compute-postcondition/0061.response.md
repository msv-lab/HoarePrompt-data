The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` has previously been increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the actual values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `MOD` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the modulo operation has been performed, but without specific values for the affected variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
