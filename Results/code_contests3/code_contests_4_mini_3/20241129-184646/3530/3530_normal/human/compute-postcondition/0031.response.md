The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. However, without knowing the previous value of `dp[i][mask]`, we cannot specify its exact new value. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp[1][1]`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2; `dp[1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[0][5]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.
