The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the new mask value used to index into the `dp` array. 

The calculation involves taking the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and adding it to `dp[i][mask]`, with the result being taken modulo `MOD`. 

Without knowing the specific values in `dp` and `MOD`, we cannot determine the exact output state for `dp[i][mask]`. However, we can indicate that the operation is performed, and the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated. Therefore, the output state reflects that the update takes place.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`**
