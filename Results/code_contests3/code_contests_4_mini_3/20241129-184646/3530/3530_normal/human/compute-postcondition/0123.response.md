According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to be executed again, allowing `j` to take the value of 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 3.**
