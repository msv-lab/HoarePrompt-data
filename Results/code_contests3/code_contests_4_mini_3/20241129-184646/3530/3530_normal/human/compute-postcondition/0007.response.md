According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_`, which is used as a counter in the `for` loop. Given that `_` is currently 1, and the loop iterates for `N` times, where `N` is between 1 and 21, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. To execute one more time, `N` must be at least 2, since 1 iteration has already been performed.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with one more row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be at least 2**
