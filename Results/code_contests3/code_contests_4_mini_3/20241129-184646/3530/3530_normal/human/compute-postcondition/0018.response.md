According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, which is already given in the state. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will take on values starting from 1 up to `n`. Therefore, `i` will be 1 during the first iteration of the loop. The value of `N` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as it is not used within the loop.

Hence, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be initialized to 1 (as it will be the value during the first iteration).
- Since `n` is at least 1, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
