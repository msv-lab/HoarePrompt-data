According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the last value it took during the previous iteration, which is `n-1` if the loop executed previously. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, meaning it cannot execute again since `j` will not be less than `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged after applying modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`**
