Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[3][1]` holds the sum of valid transitions modulo `MOD`, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 while the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is true (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is not zero).***
