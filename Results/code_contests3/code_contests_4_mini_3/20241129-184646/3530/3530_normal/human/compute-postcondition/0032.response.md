Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[0][5]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.***
