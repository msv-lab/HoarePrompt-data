Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions checked for each `j` in the range of `n`. If at least one condition is met during the iterations, then `dp[1][1]` reflects the cumulative updates from `dp[0][...]` values based on the corresponding conditions. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, `dp[1][1]` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
