Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions evaluated for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, resulting in the final value of `dp[2][mask]` after considering all valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, modulo `MOD`. If none of the conditions were satisfied during any iteration, `dp[2][mask]` remains unchanged.**
