The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

- `mask` is currently 3, which in binary is `11`.
- `j` is 0, so `1 << j` results in `1` (binary `01`).
- The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `3 ^ 1`, which is `2` (binary `10`).

Thus, the update becomes:
```
dp[i][3] += dp[i - 1][2]
```

The value of `dp[i][mask]` (which is `dp[i][3]`) will be incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][2]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][2]` are not directly provided, but it's indicated that `dp[i][mask]` holds a final value based on previous updates. 

Assuming `dp[i - 1][2]` has been previously calculated and holds a value (let's denote it as `x`), the new value of `dp[i][3]` will be updated accordingly.

Since the specific previous values of `dp[i][3]` and `dp[i - 1][2]` are not provided, we denote the update without loss of generality.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]` to it**.
