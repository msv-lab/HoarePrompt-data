Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, 1, or 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions checked during the loop iterations, potentially resulting in a value that is the sum of the contributions from valid previous states modulo `MOD`.**
