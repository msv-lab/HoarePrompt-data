Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
