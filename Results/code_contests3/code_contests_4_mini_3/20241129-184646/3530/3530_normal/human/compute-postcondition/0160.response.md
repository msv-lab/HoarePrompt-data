Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 1; `i` is `n`; `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\); `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed, reflecting the cumulative updates based on the conditions evaluated for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, considering all valid states for the given `mask`.**
