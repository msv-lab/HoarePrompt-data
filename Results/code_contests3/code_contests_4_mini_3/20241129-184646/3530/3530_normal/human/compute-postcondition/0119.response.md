According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. For the loop to execute a second time, the condition is satisfied as `j` (1) is less than `n` (which is at least 3).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, if the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << j holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD` for the loop to execute a second time.**
