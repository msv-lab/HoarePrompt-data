The code snippet updates the `dp` array at the index `[i][mask]` by adding the value from the previous row `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` influence the computation.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\)
- `j` is 0
- `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the condition involving `mask` and \(1 << j\) is true, meaning the bitwise AND operation yields a non-zero result.

Thus, the operation `mask ^ 1 << j` modifies `mask` by flipping the j-th bit. The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is added to `dp[i][mask]`.

As a result, the output state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the value from the previous state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
