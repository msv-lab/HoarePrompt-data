The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` is 0, we know that the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`. 

Since `a[i - 1][j]` (which is `a[1][0]`) is 1, we can also infer that `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is being accessed. The value of `mask ^ 1 << j` will compute the mask with the least significant bit toggled. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value before the addition, but we can denote the update operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `i` is 2, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `i` is 2, and `j` is 0.**
