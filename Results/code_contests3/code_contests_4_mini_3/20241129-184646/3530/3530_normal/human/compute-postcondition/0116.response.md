The line of code updates the `dp` array at index `[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Here, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0, so we need to calculate `mask ^ (1 << j)` which is `1 ^ (1 << 0)`. The expression `1 << 0` results in 1, hence `mask ^ 1` is `1 ^ 1`, which equals 0.

Now, we can summarize the impact:
- `dp[i][mask]` (which is `dp[3][1]`) will be updated by adding the value from `dp[2][0]`.

The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[3][1]` is updated by adding `dp[2][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[3][1]` is updated by adding `dp[2][0]`.**
