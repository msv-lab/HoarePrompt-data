The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not specified, but the effect is that `dp[i][mask]` will now hold a value that is reduced to fit within the range of `0` to `MOD-1`. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
