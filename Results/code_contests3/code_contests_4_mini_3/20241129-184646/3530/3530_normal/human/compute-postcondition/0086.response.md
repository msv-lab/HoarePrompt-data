Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
