According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n` (which is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, `1 << n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][i]` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 1**
