Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with \(1 << j\) is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of `dp[i][mask]`.***
