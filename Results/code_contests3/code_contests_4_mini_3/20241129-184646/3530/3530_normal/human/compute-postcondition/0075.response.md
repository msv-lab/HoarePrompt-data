Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
