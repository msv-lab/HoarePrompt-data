According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1.**
