Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true).***
