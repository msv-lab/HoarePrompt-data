According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `_` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with one row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
