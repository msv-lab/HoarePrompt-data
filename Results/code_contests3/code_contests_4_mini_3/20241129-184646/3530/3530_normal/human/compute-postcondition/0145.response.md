Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[3][2]` holds the sum of valid transitions modulo `MOD`. Additionally, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, indicating that the j-th bit of `mask` is set.***
