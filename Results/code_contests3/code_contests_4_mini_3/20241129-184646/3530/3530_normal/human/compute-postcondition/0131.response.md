The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Analyzing the initial state:
- `i` is 3
- `mask` is 2
- `j` is 0
- `dp[3][1]` holds the sum of valid transitions modulo `MOD`
- `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, meaning `a[2][0]` is 1
- The condition `mask & 1 << j` is true since `2 & 1 << 0` (which is `2 & 1`) is not zero.

The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `2 ^ 1`, which equals `3`.

Thus, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated as follows: 
- `dp[3][2] += dp[2][3]`

Since we don't know the value of `dp[2][3]` directly from the initial state, we can only indicate that the value is updated with whatever `dp[2][3]` currently holds. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0; `dp[3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[2][3]`.**
