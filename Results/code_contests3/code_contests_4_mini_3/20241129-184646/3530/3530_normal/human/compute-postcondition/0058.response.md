Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by taking modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
