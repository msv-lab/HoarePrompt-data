Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` & (1 << j) evaluates to true, then `dp[3][3]` is modified by taking modulo with `MOD`, but the exact changes cannot be determined. Otherwise, no modifications are made to `dp[3][3]`.***
