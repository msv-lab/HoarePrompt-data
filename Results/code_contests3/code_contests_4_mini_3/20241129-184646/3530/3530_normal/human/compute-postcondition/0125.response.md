The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and calculating its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 3 and `mask` is 1, which means we are concerned with `dp[3][1]`. However, the actual value of `dp[3][1]` before the operation is not specified in the initial state, nor is `MOD` given.

Since the operation does not change any variables other than `dp[3][1]`, we can't specify the new value of `dp[3][1]` without knowing its initial value or `MOD`. Therefore, the output state will mention that the operation is performed, but we cannot specify the exact value after the operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1; `dp[3][1]` is updated by taking `dp[3][1]` modulo `MOD`.**
