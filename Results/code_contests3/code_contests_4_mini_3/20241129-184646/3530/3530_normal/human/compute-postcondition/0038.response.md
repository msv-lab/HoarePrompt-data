The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but it is crucial to note that it is being updated. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value modulo `MOD`.**
