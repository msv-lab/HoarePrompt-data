`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `dp[0][i]` is unknown, but we know that `dp[0][0]` is 1. The state of other variables, including `N`, `n`, and `i`, is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, and `dp[0][i]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][i]` is 1**
