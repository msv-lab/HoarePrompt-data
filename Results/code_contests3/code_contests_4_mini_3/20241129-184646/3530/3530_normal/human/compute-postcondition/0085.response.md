The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is not directly shown, but it is modified by the modulo operation. Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD**
