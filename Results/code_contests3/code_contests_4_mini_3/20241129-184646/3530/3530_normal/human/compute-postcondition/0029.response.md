According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which means for the loop to execute a second time, `j` should be incremented to 2. Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute again must ensure that `j` is now 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is set to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
