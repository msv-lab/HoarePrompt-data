The code appends a new row of integers to the 2D list `a` by reading a line of input and converting it into a list of integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `N` is between 1 and 21, and `a` will have one more row after this operation. Since the code does not change the values of `N`, `MOD`, or `_`, only the structure of `a` is impacted by adding a new row. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a 2D list with one more row of integers from input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `_` is 2.**
