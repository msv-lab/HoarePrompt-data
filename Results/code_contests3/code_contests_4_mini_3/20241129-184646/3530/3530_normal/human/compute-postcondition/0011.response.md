According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `n`, which determines the range of `i`. The expression `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`) indicates that the loop will run `2^n` times. The variable `i` will start from 0 and go up to `2^n - 1`.

Given that `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, we can deduce that `n` must also fall within this range since `n` is defined in relation to `N`. The loop can execute regardless of the specific contents of `a` and `dp`, so long as `n` is defined and the loop condition is satisfied.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `i` starts at 0, which is the initial state of `i`.
- `n` needs to be at least 1 for `1 << n` to yield a positive value.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 0 (the initial value for the loop iteration).
- `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time.**
