Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with \(1 << j\) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
