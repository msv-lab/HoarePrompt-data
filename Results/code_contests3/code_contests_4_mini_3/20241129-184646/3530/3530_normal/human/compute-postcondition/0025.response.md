According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is at its maximum value for the last iteration, which means `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time, if the loop executes one more time, `j` will be 1. In addition, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again since `j` will need to be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
