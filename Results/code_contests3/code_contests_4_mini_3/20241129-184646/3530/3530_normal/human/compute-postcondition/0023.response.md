The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`, but it doesn't change the logical structure or the relationships of the other variables. The state of `dp[i][mask]` now reflects the applied modulo.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
