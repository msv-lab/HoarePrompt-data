The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` will modify `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of itself when divided by `MOD`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are given, but we do not know the values of `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The impact of the code is that it ensures `dp[i][mask]` is within the range defined by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
