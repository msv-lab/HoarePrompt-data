The function `func` does not take any parameters. It operates on a predefined 2D list `a` that represents the compatibility between N men and N women, where N is an integer ranging from 1 to 21. The function processes this compatibility information and returns a result based on the relationships defined in the 2D list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate compatibility information stored in a 2D list of integers and return a result based on that compatibility data.

Functionality: **The function evaluates a 2D list representing the compatibility of N men and N women and returns a result based on the compatibility data.**
