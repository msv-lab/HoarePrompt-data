The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0 or 1) that indicates compatibility between `n` men and `n` women. It computes the number of ways to pair all men with women based on their compatibility using dynamic programming and returns this count modulo 1000000007. The output is the number of valid pairings for all `n` men and `n` women.
