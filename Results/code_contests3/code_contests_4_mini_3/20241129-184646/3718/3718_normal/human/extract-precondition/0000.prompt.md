You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: So, the Berland is at war with its eternal enemy Flatland again, and Vasya, an accountant, was assigned to fulfil his duty to the nation. 

Right now the situation in Berland is dismal — their both cities are surrounded! The armies of flatlanders stand on the borders of circles, the circles' centers are in the surrounded cities. At any moment all points of the flatland ring can begin to move quickly in the direction of the city — that's the strategy the flatlanders usually follow when they besiege cities.

The berlanders are sure that they can repel the enemy's attack if they learn the exact time the attack starts. For that they need to construct a radar that would register any movement at the distance of at most r from it. Thus, we can install a radar at such point, that at least one point of the enemy ring will be in its detecting range (that is, at a distance of at most r). Then the radar can immediately inform about the enemy's attack. 

Due to the newest technologies, we can place a radar at any point without any problems. But the problem is that the berlanders have the time to make only one radar. Besides, the larger the detection radius (r) is, the more the radar costs.

That's why Vasya's task (that is, your task) is to find the minimum possible detection radius for the radar. In other words, your task is to find the minimum radius r (r ≥ 0) such, that a radar with radius r can be installed at some point and it can register the start of the movements of both flatland rings from that point. 

In this problem you can consider the cities as material points, the attacking enemy rings - as circles with centers in the cities, the radar's detection range — as a disk (including the border) with the center at the point where the radar is placed.

Input

The input files consist of two lines. Each line represents the city and the flatland ring that surrounds it as three space-separated integers xi, yi, ri (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 104; 1 ≤ ri ≤ 104) — the city's coordinates and the distance from the city to the flatlanders, correspondingly.

It is guaranteed that the cities are located at different points.

Output

Print a single real number — the minimum detection radius of the described radar. The answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6.

Note

The figure below shows the answer to the first sample. In this sample the best decision is to put the radar at point with coordinates (2, 0).
