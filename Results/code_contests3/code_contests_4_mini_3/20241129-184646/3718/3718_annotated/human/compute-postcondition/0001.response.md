The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two cities, with values ranging from -10,000 to 10,000. After executing the function body, it returns the distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using the distance formula. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities and return the calculated distance between those cities. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, and returns the distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).**
