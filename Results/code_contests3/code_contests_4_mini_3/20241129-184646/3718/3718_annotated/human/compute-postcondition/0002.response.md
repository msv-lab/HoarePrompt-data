Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points using the distance formula. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as the input values being out of the specified range (-10,000 to 10,000), but it will compute the distance accurately as long as the inputs are valid integers. **
