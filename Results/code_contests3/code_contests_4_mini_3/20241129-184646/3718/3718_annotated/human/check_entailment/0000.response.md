Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of two cities (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It does not address the problem described, which requires finding the minimum detection radius for a radar that can cover both enemy rings surrounding the cities.

To meet the problem description, the program needs to:
1. Calculate the positions of the enemy rings based on the distances (r1 and r2) from the cities.
2. Determine the minimum radius r such that a radar can detect the start of the movements of both rings.

The current implementation fails to perform these necessary calculations and logic. It does not take into account the distances of the rings or how to position the radar effectively. As a result, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.
