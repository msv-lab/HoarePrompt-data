The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two distinct cities (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and it returns the Euclidean distance between these two points. There are no checks for the validity of the input coordinates, but it is assumed that the coordinates represent two different cities as per the input precondition.
