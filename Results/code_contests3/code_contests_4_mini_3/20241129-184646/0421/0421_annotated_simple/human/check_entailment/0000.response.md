Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This would cause a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Logic for Checking Pairs**: The logic that checks if any two consecutive elements in `nums` differ by 2 or more (`if abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`) is done in a loop that checks all pairs in `nums` repeatedly until `nums` is empty. However, it does not account for the case where the maximum height is removed and new pairs are formed as a result of the removal. 

3. **Removing Maximum**: The program removes the maximum element from `nums` but does not correctly simulate the shifting of stacks after a removal, which is necessary according to the problem description. It also fails to create an output array based on the heights of the stacks removed.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic uses `print['NO', 'YES'][flag]`, which is not the correct syntax for printing in Python. It should use parentheses instead of square brackets. 

5. **Final Condition**: The flag is set to `False` when a pair of adjacent stacks has a height difference of 2 or more, but this check should be more comprehensive. The program should ensure that this condition is checked after each removal of the maximum stack to account for changes in the array.

Given these issues, the program does not accurately implement the described algorithm and will not produce the correct output for all potential cases.
