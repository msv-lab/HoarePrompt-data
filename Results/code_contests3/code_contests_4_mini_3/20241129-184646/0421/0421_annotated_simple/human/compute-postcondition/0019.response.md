To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop. The loop will continue executing as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.

1. The variable `flag` is currently False if there is any pair of consecutive integers in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more. For the loop to execute again, we need `flag` to be True. 
2. The variable `nums` contains at least one integer after removing the maximum integer from it, which implies that `nums` is not empty.

Given that `flag` is currently False, we need to adjust it so that it becomes True. This means that we must ensure there are no pairs of consecutive integers in `nums` that have an absolute difference of 2 or more.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state to make `flag` True while keeping `nums` non-empty.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer; for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty**
