The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value of `True` to `False`. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has more than 1 element, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
