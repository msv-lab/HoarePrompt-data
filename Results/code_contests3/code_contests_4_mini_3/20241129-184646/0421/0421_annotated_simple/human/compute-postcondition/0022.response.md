`flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, so now `flag` is updated to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
