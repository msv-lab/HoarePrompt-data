The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least two integers, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
