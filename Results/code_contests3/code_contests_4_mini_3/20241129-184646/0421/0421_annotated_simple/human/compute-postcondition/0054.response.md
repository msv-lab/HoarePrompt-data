Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by `n` space-separated integers representing the heights of stacks of ravioli. It checks if there are any consecutive heights that differ by 2 or more; if such a pair exists, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The function continues to check until all maximum heights have been removed, but if there are only two heights, it does not handle the case correctly, potentially missing some conditions. **
