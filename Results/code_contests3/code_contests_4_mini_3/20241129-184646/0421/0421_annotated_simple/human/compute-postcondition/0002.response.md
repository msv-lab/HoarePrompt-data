In the provided code, `nums` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This means that the input string representing an integer from `raw_input()` will be split into individual string elements, and each element will be converted to an integer using `int()`. 

Since `n` is an input string representing an integer, it will not directly affect the assignment to `nums`, which will hold a map object of integers derived from the user input. However, the `flag` variable remains unchanged.

The output state does not specify the contents of `nums` since it depends on the input provided at runtime. Therefore, the output state simply reflects the unchanged variables and the creation of `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object of integers from user input.**
