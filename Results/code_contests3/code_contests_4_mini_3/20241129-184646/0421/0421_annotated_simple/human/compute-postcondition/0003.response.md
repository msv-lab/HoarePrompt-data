According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, which is fine for the loop to run. However, since `nums` is a map object, it needs to contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `nums` must not be empty.

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that `nums` has been initialized with at least one integer input from the user.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must contain at least one integer**
