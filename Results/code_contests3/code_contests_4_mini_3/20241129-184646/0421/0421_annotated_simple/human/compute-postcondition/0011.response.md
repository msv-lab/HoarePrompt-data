The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least two integers, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or statement.
