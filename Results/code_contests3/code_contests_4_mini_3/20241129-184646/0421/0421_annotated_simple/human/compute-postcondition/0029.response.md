According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means that the loop can execute again if `len(nums)` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**
