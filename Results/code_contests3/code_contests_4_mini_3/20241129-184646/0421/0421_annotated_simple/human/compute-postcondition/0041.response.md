According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its value, and since the loop has not broken out, it means that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` was less than 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. If `i` is currently at its maximum value (i.e., `len(nums) - 2`), then after the increment, it will be `len(nums) - 1`, which is the limit for the loop's execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. The conditions involving `n`, `flag`, and the contents of `nums` remain unchanged, as the loop does not alter them.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has more than 1 element, and for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1, hence `i` will be `current_value + 1`.**
