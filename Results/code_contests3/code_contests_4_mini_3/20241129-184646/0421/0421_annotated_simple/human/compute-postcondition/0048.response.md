Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, and `nums` is not empty with more than 1 element. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
