The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has more than 1 element, `i` is `current_value + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
