The loop checks the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the `nums` list. If any of these differences are greater than or equal to 2, it sets `flag` to False and breaks out of the loop. If the loop executes without breaking, `flag` remains True. The loop will not execute if `nums` has fewer than 2 elements.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- If any absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` will be False.
- If no such difference exists for all pairs, `flag` will remain True.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is either True or False depending on the values in `nums`, and `nums` is not empty.**
