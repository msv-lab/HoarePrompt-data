According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `nums`. The loop will execute if the length of `nums` is greater than 1, since `len(nums) - 1` must be at least 0 for the loop to start. Additionally, `flag` must be set to True for the condition to allow the loop to execute again. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, and since `nums` is not empty, we can assume it has at least one element. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we also need to confirm that the length of `nums` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty and has more than 1 element, `i` is 0**
