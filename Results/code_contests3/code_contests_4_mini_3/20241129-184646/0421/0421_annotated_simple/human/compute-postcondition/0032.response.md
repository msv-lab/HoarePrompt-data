Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any change to `flag`, `n`, or `nums`.***
