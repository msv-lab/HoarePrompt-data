The value of `n` is assigned the result of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. Since `n` is expected to be an integer within the range from 1 to 10, it will hold that value as a string initially. Other variables are not affected at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer**
