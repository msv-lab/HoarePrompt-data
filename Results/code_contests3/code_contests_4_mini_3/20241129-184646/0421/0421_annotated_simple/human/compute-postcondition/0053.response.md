The function `func` does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it processes input consisting of an integer `n`, which represents the number of stacks of ravioli, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai`, where each `ai` represents the height of the respective stack of ravioli. After executing the function body, it produces an output based on the heights of the stacks. The specifics of the output are not provided, but it typically involves some form of computation or analysis based on the input heights.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), representing the heights of stacks of ravioli, and returns a result based on the heights of these stacks.**
