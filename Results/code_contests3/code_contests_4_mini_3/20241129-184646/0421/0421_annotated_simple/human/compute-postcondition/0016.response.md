Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, and `nums` contains at least two integers. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop is exited; otherwise, the loop continues as `i` is incremented for the next iteration.***
