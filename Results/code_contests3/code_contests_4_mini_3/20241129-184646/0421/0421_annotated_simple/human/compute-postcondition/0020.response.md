According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. For the loop to execute, `flag` must be True, and `nums` must not be empty. Additionally, `i` should start at 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
