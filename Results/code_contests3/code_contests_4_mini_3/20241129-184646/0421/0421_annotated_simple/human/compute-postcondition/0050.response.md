The `max(nums)` function finds the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the first occurrence of this maximum value from the list. Since `nums` is not empty, there is a maximum value to be removed. The value of `n` and `flag` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nums` after the maximum value has been removed.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is either True or False depending on the values in `nums`, `nums` has had its maximum value removed**
