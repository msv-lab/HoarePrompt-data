According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`, so the maximum value `i` can take is `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `current_value + 1`. Since `nums` has more than 1 element, `len(nums)` is at least 2, making `len(nums) - 2` at least `0`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`. If `i` is currently `current_value + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `current_value + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `i` must not exceed `len(nums) - 2`. 

Thus, `i` will be `current_value + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, it must hold that `current_value + 2` is less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2`, which means `current_value` must be less than or equal to `len(nums) - 4`.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has more than 1 element, `i` is `current_value + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `current_value` must be less than or equal to `len(nums) - 4**.
