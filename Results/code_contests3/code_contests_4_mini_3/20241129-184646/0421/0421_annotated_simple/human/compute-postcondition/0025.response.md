According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` is not empty, so `len(nums)` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The loop can only execute again as long as `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**
