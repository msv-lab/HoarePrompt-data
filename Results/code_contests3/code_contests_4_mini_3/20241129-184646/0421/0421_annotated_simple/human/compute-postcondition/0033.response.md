Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` is False if any consecutive pair of elements in `nums` has an absolute difference of 2 or greater; otherwise, `flag` remains True. `nums` is not empty, and `i` would be equal to `len(nums) - 1` if the loop executes completely, or less if it breaks early.**
