According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if any consecutive pair of elements in `nums` has an absolute difference of 2 or greater, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be set to True. Additionally, `nums` must still contain elements for the loop to be able to continue.

Since `nums` is not empty at the end of the previous iteration, we do not need to adjust that state. However, we do need to adjust `flag` to ensure it is True so that the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer, `flag` needs to be True for the loop to execute again, `nums` is not empty**
