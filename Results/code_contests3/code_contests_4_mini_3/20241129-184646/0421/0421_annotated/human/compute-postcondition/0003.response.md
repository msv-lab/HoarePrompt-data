According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a map object derived from an input split string. For the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must contain at least one element (i.e., it should not be empty). 

Since `nums` is a map object, it will be empty if the input split string is empty. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust the input such that the split string results in at least one integer.

State: **`n` is an integer input representing the size of the array; `flag` is True; for the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must contain at least one element (i.e., the input split string should not be empty)**
