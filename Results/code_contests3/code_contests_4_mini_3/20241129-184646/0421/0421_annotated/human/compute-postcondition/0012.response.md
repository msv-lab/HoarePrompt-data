Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues execution without breaking.***
