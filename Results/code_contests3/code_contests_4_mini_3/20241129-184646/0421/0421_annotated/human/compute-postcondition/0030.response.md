The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, which is its current value. No other variables are affected, and since the loop cannot execute again, there is no change in the state of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and the loop cannot execute again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and the loop cannot execute again.**
