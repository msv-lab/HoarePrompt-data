Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the number of stacks of ravioli, followed by `n` space-separated integers representing the heights of the stacks. It checks if the absolute difference between the heights of any two consecutive stacks is less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False. The function repeatedly removes the maximum height stack until either all stacks are removed or a stack difference condition fails. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True, indicating all conditions were met, or 'NO' if the flag is False, indicating a condition was breached. Note that if there are fewer than 2 stacks, the function will always print 'YES' since the loop will not execute. **
