The `max(nums)` function finds the maximum value in the `nums` list, and the `remove` method will remove the first occurrence of this maximum value from the list. The state of `n`, `flag`, and `nums` will change accordingly. The specific values of `n` and `flag` are not affected, but `nums` will have one element removed.

Assuming the maximum element is removed from `nums`, the output state will reflect the updated `nums` list after the removal.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `flag` is True, and `nums` is the original list without its maximum element.**
