The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `flag`. Since `flag` was already `False`, there is no change in its state. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1**
