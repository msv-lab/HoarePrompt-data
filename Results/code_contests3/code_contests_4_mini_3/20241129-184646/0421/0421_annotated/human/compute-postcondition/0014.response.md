The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which it already held. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. There's no change to the values of `n`, `i`, or any other variables. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `i` is 2**
