According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

Since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 2`, it will increment to `len(nums) - 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which will not be the case after the next iteration. 

No changes to the other state variables are necessary as they remain the same. Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements.**
