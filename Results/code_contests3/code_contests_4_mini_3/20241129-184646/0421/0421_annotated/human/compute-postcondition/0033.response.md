To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we will analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates through elements of `nums` and checks if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If it finds such a pair, it sets `flag` to False and exits the loop. If it completes all iterations without finding such a pair, `flag` remains True.

1. If `nums` is empty or has only one element, the loop will not execute, and `flag` will remain True.
2. If `nums` has two or more elements, the loop will execute up to `len(nums) - 1` times.

After all iterations:
- If at least one pair with an absolute difference of 2 or more is found, `flag` will be False.
- If no such pairs are found, `flag` will remain True.

Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` will eventually reach `len(nums) - 1` if the loop runs to completion.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will depend on the presence of the absolute difference condition among the elements in `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is either True or False depending on whether all adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference less than 2, `i` is `len(nums) - 1` if the loop executed, and `nums` is not empty if the loop executed.**
