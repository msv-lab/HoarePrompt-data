Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
