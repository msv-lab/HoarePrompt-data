Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, and `nums` contains at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no action is taken, and the program continues to execute.***
