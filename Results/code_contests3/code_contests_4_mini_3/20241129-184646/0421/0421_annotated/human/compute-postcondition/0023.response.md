The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 2, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
