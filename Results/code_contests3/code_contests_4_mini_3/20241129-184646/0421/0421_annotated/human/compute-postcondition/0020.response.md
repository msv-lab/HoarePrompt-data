According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(nums)`. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `len(nums) - 2`, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2 for `i` to be a valid index in the range of the loop. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `nums` must not be empty.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2, which means `i` should be `len(nums) - 2`, and `flag` remains True.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, for the loop to execute `nums` must not be empty and `len(nums)` must be at least 2**
