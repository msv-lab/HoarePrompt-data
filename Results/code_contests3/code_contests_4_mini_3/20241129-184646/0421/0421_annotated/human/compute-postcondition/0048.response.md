Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
