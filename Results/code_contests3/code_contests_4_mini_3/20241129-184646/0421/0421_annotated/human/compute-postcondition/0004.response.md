According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` array's length. The loop will only execute if `len(nums) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute. 

Given that `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, and we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one element for the loop to execute, we can assume that `nums` is a list derived from a string split operation. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer input representing the size of the array and must be greater than 0, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a list with at least 1 element**
