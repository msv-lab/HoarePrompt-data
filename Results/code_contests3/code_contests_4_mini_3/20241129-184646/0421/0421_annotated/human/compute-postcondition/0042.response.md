The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its current value. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
