Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains True and the execution continues.***
