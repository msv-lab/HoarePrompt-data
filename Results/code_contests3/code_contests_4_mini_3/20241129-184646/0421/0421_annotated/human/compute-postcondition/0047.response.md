The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
