The function accepts no parameters but reads an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers. It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers in the list is less than 2. If such a difference is found, the function sets a flag to False. It also repeatedly removes the maximum value from the list until no further removals can be made. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True (indicating all consecutive differences were less than 2) and 'NO' otherwise. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where `n` is outside the specified range.
