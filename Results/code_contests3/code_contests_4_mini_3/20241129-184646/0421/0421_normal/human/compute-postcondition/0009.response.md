According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-empty string and `flag` is False. The loop index `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, if the loop has executed `i` times, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, becoming `i + 1`.

Since `len(nums) - 1` is the upper limit for `i`, `nums` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, if the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` which means `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
