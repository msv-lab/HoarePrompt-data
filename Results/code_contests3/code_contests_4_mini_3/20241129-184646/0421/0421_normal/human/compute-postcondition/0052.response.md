The code attempts to print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`. The `print` function is used with a list indexing approach to select the appropriate string. If `flag` is `False`, it will print 'NO' (index 0), and if `flag` is `True`, it will print 'YES' (index 1). 

Since `flag` can only be either `True` or `False`, the output will depend on its current state. The values of `n` and `nums` are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list containing the remaining elements, and the print output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list containing the remaining elements, and the print output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.**
