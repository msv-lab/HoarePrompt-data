Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the absolute difference is less than 2, no action is taken, and the loop continues to execute.***
