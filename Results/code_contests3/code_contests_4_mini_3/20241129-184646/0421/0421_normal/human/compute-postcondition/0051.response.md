Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` was greater than or equal to 2 during the iterations, otherwise `flag` is True; `nums` is a non-empty list containing the remaining elements after repeatedly removing the maximum value until no further removals can be made.**
