The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1.**
