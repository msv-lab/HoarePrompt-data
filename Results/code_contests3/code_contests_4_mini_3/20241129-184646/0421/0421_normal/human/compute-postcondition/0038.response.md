The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, so after execution, `flag` is now `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
