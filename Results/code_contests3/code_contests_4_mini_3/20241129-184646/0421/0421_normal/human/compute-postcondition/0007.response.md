The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
