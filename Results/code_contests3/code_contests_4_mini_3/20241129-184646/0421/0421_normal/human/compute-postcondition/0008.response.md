Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string and `flag` is False. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the program continues execution without any changes to `flag` or `n`.***
