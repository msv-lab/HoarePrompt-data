According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` contains at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

Since we have the absolute difference condition that could lead to breaking out of the loop, we need to ensure that, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. This means that `len(nums)` must be at least 3 (because when `i` is 2, `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than 2.**
