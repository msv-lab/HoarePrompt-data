According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, allowing for `i` to be incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased to 1. The loop will continue as long as the condition for breaking out of the loop is not met.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must have an absolute difference less than 2.**
