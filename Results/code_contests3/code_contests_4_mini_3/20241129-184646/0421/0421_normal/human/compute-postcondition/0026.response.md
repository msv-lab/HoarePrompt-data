The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, which is already its current value. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
