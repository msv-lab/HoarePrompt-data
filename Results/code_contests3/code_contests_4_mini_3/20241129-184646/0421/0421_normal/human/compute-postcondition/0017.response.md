The loop checks the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the `nums` list. If any such difference is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop breaks. If the loop completes without finding any such difference, `flag` remains True.

If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute, and `flag` will remain True.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `flag` is True.**
