The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing it from its initial state of `True`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
