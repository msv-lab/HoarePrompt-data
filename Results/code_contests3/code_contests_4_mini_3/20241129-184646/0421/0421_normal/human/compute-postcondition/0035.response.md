According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if any absolute difference was greater than or equal to 2, and `flag` is True otherwise. Since `flag` is currently False, it needs to be adjusted to True for the loop to execute again. Additionally, `nums` must also be non-empty.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, flag is True for the loop to execute again, and nums must be non-empty**
