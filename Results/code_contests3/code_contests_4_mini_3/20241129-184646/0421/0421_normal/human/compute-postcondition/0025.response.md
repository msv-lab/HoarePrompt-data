According to the code, the loop can execute again if the current value of `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` contains at least 2 elements, so `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Since the absolute difference condition has been satisfied, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition for the loop to execute again will still need to be valid, meaning that `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than 1 (which it is, since `nums` has at least 2 elements).

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
