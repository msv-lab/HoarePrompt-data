According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2, making `len(nums) - 1` at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 2. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`, which implies that `len(nums)` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2.**
