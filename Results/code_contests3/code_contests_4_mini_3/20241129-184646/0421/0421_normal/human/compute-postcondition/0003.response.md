According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty (i.e., contains elements). Right before the loop, `flag` is set to True, which is correct for the loop to execute. However, `nums` is a map object resulting from splitting the input string `n` by spaces. 

For the loop to execute at least one time, `n` must be a string that, when split by spaces, produces at least one element in the `nums` map. Therefore, `n` should not be an empty string. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is set to True**
