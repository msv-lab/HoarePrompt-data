According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, which indicates that all absolute differences between consecutive elements in `nums` are less than 2, and `nums` is a non-empty string. However, since the maximum value has been removed from `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` still contains elements for the loop to execute one more time.

To ensure that `nums` is not empty after removing the maximum value, `nums` must have contained more than one element initially. Therefore, if `nums` originally had only one element, it would be empty after the maximum value is removed.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is True, and for the loop to execute again, `nums` must contain elements (originally had more than one element)**
