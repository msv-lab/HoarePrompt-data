Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the execution continues without changing the state of `flag`.***
