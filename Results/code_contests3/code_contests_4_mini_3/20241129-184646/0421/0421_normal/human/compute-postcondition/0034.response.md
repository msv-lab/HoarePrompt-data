The `remove` method is called on the list `nums`, which removes the maximum value from the list. The initial state indicates that `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and the maximum value will be removed from it. The variable `flag` is not affected by this operation, and its value remains the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False if any absolute difference was greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `flag` is True, and the maximum element has been removed from `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False if any absolute difference was greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `flag` is True, and the maximum element has been removed from `nums`.**
