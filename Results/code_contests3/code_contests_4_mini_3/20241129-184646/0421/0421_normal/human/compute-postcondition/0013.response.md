According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, meaning it is now one more than its previous value. 

Since `i` is incremented, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. If `i` is currently at a value where `i + 1` is still a valid index, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, if `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, it can still execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`**
