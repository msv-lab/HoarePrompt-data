To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

The code `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the maximum value from the list `nums`. This operation affects the variable `nums`, which will have one less element after the execution. The values of `n` and `flag` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the change in the `nums` variable after the maximum value has been removed. Since we do not have the specific contents of `nums`, we cannot specify the new value of `nums` but can state that it has had the maximum value removed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `flag` is True, and the maximum value has been removed from `nums`.**
