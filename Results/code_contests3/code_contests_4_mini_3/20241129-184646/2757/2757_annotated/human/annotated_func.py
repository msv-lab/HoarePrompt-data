#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if the character 'ch' is not a vowel (not in 'aeiou'), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which consists of small English letters. It returns True if the character `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., not one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'); otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that `ch` will always be a single character, as per the given constraints.
