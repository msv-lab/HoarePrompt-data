Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only defines a function `func_1` that checks if a single character is a consonant or not. It returns `True` if the character is a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), but it does not implement any logic to detect typos in a word as described in the problem statement.

The problem description requires the implementation of a feature that identifies typos in a word by checking for sequences of three or more consonants in a row, with the exception of sequences made up of the same letter. The program must then split the word into parts such that each part does not contain any typos. 

Since the provided program only handles single characters and does not process entire words or enforce the typo-checking and splitting requirements, it does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, it fails to provide a correct solution for the problem.
