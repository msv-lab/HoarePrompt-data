You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Beroffice text editor has a wide range of features that help working with text. One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.

Beroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.

For example:

  * the following words have typos: "hellno", "hackcerrs" and "backtothefutttture"; 
  * the following words don't have typos: "helllllooooo", "tobeornottobe" and "oooooo". 



When Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.

Implement this feature of Beroffice editor. Consider the following letters as the only vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. All the other letters are consonants in this problem.

Input

The only line contains a non-empty word consisting of small English letters. The length of the word is between 1 and 3000 letters.

Output

Print the given word without any changes if there are no typos.

If there is at least one typo in the word, insert the minimum number of spaces into the word so that each of the resulting words doesn't have any typos. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Examples

Input

hellno


Output

hell no 


Input

abacaba


Output

abacaba 


Input

asdfasdf


Output

asd fasd f 
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if the character 'ch' is not a vowel (not in 'aeiou'), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which consists of small English letters. It returns True if the character `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., not one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'); otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that `ch` will always be a single character, as per the given constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
