The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which consists of small English letters. It returns True if the character `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., not one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'); otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that `ch` will always be a single character, as per the given constraints.
