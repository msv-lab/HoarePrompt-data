To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and consider various potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Functionality**: 
   - The program defines a function `func_1(ch)` that checks if a character is a consonant (not a vowel).
   - It reads an input word and checks for consecutive consonants.
   - If it finds three consecutive consonants that are not all the same, it separates them with a space. Specifically, it writes out the first two consonants followed by a space.

2. **Logic Issue**:
   - The condition within the loop checks for three consecutive consonants but writes out only two of them followed by a space. If there are four consonants (e.g., "cccc"), it would only write "cc " and then continue, potentially leaving the remaining consonants unprocessed or incorrectly formatted.
   - The program does not handle the situation where there are multiple groups of consecutive consonants properly, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the input "hackcerrs". According to the problem:
- "hackcerrs" contains the substring "ckc" (consonants) which are not the same, hence it has a typo.
- The correct output should be "hack cer rs" to avoid the typo.

However, the program will incorrectly output "hack cer " and then "rs" as it does not process the sequence correctly due to how it handles the spacing and the consecutive consonants.

### Conclusion:
There are cases where the program fails to produce correct outputs as per the problem description. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
