#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, and its length is between 1 and 3000 characters.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if the character 'ch' is not a vowel (i.e., not in 'aeiou'), and False if it is a vowel.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which is expected to be a single character, and returns True if that character is not a vowel (i.e., not in 'aeiou'). If `ch` is a vowel, it returns False. Note that if `ch` contains more than one character, the function will still evaluate it as a string, which could lead to unexpected results since it is not explicitly stated that `ch` should be a single character.
