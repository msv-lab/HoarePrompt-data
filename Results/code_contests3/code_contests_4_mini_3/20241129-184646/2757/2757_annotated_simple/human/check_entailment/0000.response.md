Correctness: **False**

The provided program only checks whether a single character (`ch`) is a consonant or a vowel. It returns `True` if the character is a consonant and `False` if it is a vowel. However, this is insufficient to meet the requirements of the problem description, which involves checking entire words for the presence of typos based on the rules of consecutive consonants and their grouping.

The problem requires the implementation of logic to:
1. Identify blocks of three or more consonants in a word.
2. Determine if any of these blocks contain at least two different consonants, which would then classify the word as having a typo.
3. If a typo is detected, insert spaces into the word to eliminate the typos.

The current program does not perform any of these tasks. It does not analyze a word, does not check for consecutive consonants, and does not handle the insertion of spaces. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description's requirements, making it incorrect.
