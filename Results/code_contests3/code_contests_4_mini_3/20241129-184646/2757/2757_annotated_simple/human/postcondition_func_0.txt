The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `ch` is a consonant and `False` if `ch` is a vowel. However, as it checks for membership in the string 'aeiou', it will not handle cases where `ch` is a string longer than one character, which could lead to incorrect results.
