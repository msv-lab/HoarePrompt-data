#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is a consonant and False if 'ch' is a vowel
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns `True` if `ch` is a consonant and `False` if `ch` is a vowel. However, as it checks for membership in the string 'aeiou', it will not handle cases where `ch` is a string longer than one character, which could lead to incorrect results.
