To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its handling of the specified logic regarding typos in words.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1(ch)`**: It returns `True` if the character `ch` is a consonant (not a vowel). It checks if the character is in the string 'aeiou'.

2. **Main Loop**: 
   - The program iterates through the string `s` while checking for blocks of three consonants in a row.
   - It checks a triplet of characters (s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2]) to determine if they are consonants and if they are not all the same.
   - If found, it writes the first two consonants followed by a space, effectively breaking the word into two parts at that point.
   - The program continues to check the rest of the string after handling the first identified typo.

3. **Final Loop**: After processing the initial loop, it outputs any remaining characters.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Consonants**:
   - When it finds three consonants in a row that are not the same, it only outputs the first two followed by a space. However, it does not properly handle cases where the sequence might continue with more consonants, potentially leading to more typos.
   - For example, in the word "hackcerrs", the loop will only break at "hackc" and will not appropriately handle the second block of consonants "rrs".

2. **Lack of Proper Output for Multiple Typos**: 
   - The program does not check for additional consonants after it breaks the word. For example, if the input is "backtothefutttture", the code will not function correctly because it may not insert spaces where needed after the initial handling of the first typo.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The program assumes that breaking at the first detected typo is sufficient, which may not be true for longer sequences of consonants or multiple typos in a row.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails

Consider the input "hackcerrs". The expected output should be "hack cer rs", but the program will produce "hack cers" since it only breaks the first part and does not account for the remaining consonants.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to handle all potential cases of typos in the input word according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
