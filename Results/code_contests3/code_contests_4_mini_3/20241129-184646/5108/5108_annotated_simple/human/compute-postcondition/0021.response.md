The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, with each character having an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive. The string may include the characters 'H', 'Q', '9', and '+', which are special instructions in the HQ9+ programming language. After executing the function body, the behavior of the function will depend on the specific instructions present in `p`. However, since no specific output behavior is given for the instructions, we can summarize that the function processes the string based on these characters according to the rules of the HQ9+ language. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `p` containing 1 to 100 characters, and processes it according to the instructions of the HQ9+ programming language.**
