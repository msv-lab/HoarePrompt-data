The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. Since `a` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, the value of `i`, which is the third character of `a`, will be `r`. The string `p` remains unchanged. The output state is updated to reflect the new value of `a` and `i`. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 'r', and 'YES' is printed.**
