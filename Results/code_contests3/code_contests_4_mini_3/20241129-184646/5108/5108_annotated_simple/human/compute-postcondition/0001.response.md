According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `a`. The loop will iterate over each character in `a`. If `a` is an empty string, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the string `a` must contain at least one character. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the value of the first character of `a` in its first iteration. Given this, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `a` is non-empty and specify the initial value of `i`.

State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `a`**
