`a` is assigned the value 'tstr123', which means the previous value of `a` is replaced. The variable `i`, which is the first character of `a`, will now be 't'. Since `i` is no longer 'H', 'Q', or '9', the condition for printing 'YES' is not satisfied, therefore the output state reflects that the value of `a` has changed and `i` no longer meets the condition. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and 'YES' is not printed.**
