`a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The previous value of `a` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the second character of `a`, which remains unchanged. The output remains 'YES' and is not affected by the assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's'; the output is 'YES'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's'; the output is 'YES'**.
