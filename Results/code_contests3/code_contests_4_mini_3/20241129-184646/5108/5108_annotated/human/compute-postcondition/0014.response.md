The value of `a` is assigned the string `'tstr123'`. However, `a` already holds the value `'tstr123'`, so there is no change in the value of `a`. The other variable `p` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and 'YES' is printed.**
