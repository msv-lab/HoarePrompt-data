The variable `a` is assigned the string value `'tstr123'`. This does not affect the string `p`, which still contains between 1 and 100 characters, nor does it impact the variable `i`, which is supposed to represent the next character in `a`. The statement mentions that 'YES' is printed, but the printing does not change the values of the variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the next character in `a` and 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the next character in `a` and 'YES' is printed.**
