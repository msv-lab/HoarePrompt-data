The code assigns the string 'tstr123' to the variable `a`. The initial state of the variable `p` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `p` along with the new assignment of `a`.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'**
