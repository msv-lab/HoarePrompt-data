Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if it contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets a variable to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not actually accept an external parameter `p` as indicated in the annotations, and the string length is not validated, meaning it can also accept an empty string or a string longer than 100 characters.**
