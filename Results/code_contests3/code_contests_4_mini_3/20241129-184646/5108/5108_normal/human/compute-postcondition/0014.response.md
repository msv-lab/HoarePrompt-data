`a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`, which does not affect the other variables. Given that `i` is the character at position `j+1` in `a`, and since `a` has at least `j+2` characters, the value of `i` will be determined based on the value of `j`. However, without the specific value of `j`, we cannot determine `i` directly. The string `p` remains unchanged. The program prints 'YES', but that does not affect the values of the variables.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'; `i` is the character at position `j+1` in `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
