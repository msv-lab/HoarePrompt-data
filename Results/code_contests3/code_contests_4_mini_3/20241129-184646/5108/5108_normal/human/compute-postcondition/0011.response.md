Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If `i` is one of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of those characters, the loop continues executing, as `i` must be checked against the next character in `a`.***
