The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive. However, since there is no specific output or behavior provided in the output section, we cannot determine the exact return values or additional cases. Therefore, based on the information given, we can only describe the accepted parameter.
