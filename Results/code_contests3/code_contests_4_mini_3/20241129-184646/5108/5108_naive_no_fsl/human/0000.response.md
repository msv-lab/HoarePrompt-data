Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the instruction "Q" correctly. According to the problem description, if the input string contains "Q", it should output "YES" since it prints the source code of the program itself. However, the program only checks for "H", "Q", and "9" and mistakenly does not consider "Q" as a valid instruction that would lead to output, since it only checks whether it is in the list `['H', 'Q', '9']` but does not print "YES" for "Q". 

For example, if the input is "Q", the expected output should be "YES" because the program should print its own source code, but the current code would result in "NO" since it doesn't properly handle this instruction. Thus, the program is incorrect.
