Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a map object of integers derived from a ticket number represented as a string of length exactly `n` containing only the digits 4 and 7. If the sum of the first half of `digits` equals the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
