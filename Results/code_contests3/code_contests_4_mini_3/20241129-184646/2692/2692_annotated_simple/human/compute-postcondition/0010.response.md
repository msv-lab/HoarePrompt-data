Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number represented as a string of exactly `n` digits, which can only be '4' and '7'. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, if the input does not strictly adhere to the specified format (i.e., the ticket number must contain only '4' and '7'), the function does not handle such cases or provide any errors or warnings. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.**
