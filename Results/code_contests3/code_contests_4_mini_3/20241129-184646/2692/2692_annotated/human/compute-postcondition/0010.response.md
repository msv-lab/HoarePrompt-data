Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and expects a sequence of digits that must be exactly `n` digits long, containing only the digits 4 and 7. It calculates the sum of the first half of these digits and compares it to the sum of the second half. If the two sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, it does not validate whether the input digits only contain 4s and 7s. If the input does not strictly adhere to this requirement, the function may produce unexpected results. **
