`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input string, removes leading and trailing whitespace with `strip`, and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables are not affected, and since `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `n` will hold a valid input integer within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**
