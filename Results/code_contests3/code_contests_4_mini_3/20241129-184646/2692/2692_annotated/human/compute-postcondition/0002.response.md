`digits` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string, `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts the input string into a sequence of integers. The variable `n` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a sequence of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a sequence of integers derived from the input.**
