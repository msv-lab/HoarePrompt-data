The function `func` does not take any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the ticket number is a positive integer of exactly `n` digits, containing only the digits 4 and 7. The function evaluates the ticket number based on these criteria. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a ticket number that adheres to the specified constraints and determine its validity without explicitly taking parameters. 

Functionality: **The function checks if a ticket number is a positive integer with exactly n digits, containing only the digits 4 and 7, where n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**
