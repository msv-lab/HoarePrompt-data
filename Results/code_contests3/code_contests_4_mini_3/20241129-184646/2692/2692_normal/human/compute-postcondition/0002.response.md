The `digits` variable is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` is expected to receive a string input representing a ticket number made up of the digits 4 and 7. The `strip()` method is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each character in the stripped input string into an integer. 

Since `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, the input string will have exactly `n` digits, all of which will be either 4 or 7. The values of `n` and the ticket number do not directly change, but `digits` will hold an iterable of integers corresponding to the digits of the ticket number.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is an iterable of integers representing the digits of the ticket number, which are either 4 or 7.**
