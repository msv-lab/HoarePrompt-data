The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket_number`. The parameter `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). The parameter `ticket_number` is a string of digits with a length exactly equal to `n` and contains only the digits '4' and '7'. 

The function evaluates the `ticket_number` based on the following criteria:
- Case 1: If the number of '4's in `ticket_number` is equal to the number of '7's, the function returns "Lucky".
- Case 2: If the number of '4's is not equal to the number of '7's, the function returns "Unlucky".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` and a string `ticket_number` consisting solely of the digits '4' and '7', and determine if the ticket is "Lucky" or "Unlucky" based on the counts of these digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (an even integer between 2 and 50) and a parameter ticket_number (a string of exactly n digits consisting of '4' and '7'), returning "Lucky" if the counts of '4's and '7's are equal, and "Unlucky" otherwise.**
