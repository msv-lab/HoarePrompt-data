`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` reads a line of input, `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and `int()` converts the input to an integer. Since `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `n` will be updated to the input integer value within this range. The ticket number, being unaffected by this code snippet, remains as a string of digits with length exactly `n` that contains only the digits 4 and 7. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; the ticket number is a string of digits with length exactly `n` that contains only the digits 4 and 7**
