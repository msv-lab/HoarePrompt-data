Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is an iterable of integers representing the digits of the ticket number, which are either 4 or 7; the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (up to `n / 2`) is equal to the sum of the remaining elements in `digits` starting from `n / 2 + n % 2`.***
