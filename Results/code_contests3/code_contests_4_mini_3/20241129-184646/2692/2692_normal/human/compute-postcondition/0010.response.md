Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and reads a string of digits from input, which must be exactly `n` characters long and consist of the digits '4' and '7'. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, the function does not return any values, as it only prints the result to the console. Additionally, it assumes that the input is valid and does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified conditions. **
