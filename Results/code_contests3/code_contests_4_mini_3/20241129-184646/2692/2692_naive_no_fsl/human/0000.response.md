Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining if a ticket is a lucky ticket based on the problem description.

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check whether all digits of the ticket number are either '4' or '7'. According to the problem description, a lucky ticket must be a lucky number, which means that all digits must be lucky digits (4 or 7). The code currently skips this check.

2. **Sum Calculation Error**: The way the second half of the digits is accessed in the sum calculation is incorrect. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` does not correctly isolate the second half of the ticket's digits. It should be `digits[n / 2:]`.

3. **Input Handling**: The code uses `raw_input()`, which is correct for Python 2 but not for Python 3. If we assume the use of Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.

Given these issues, the code will produce incorrect results for cases where the ticket number contains digits other than '4' or '7', or the second half is incorrectly calculated.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1234
```
The expected output should be "NO" because 1234 is not a lucky number, but since the program does not check this, it would incorrectly output "NO" based on the sums (which will also not equal).

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem in multiple ways, making it incorrect.
