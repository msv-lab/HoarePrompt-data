To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
1. A ticket number is lucky if:
   - It is a lucky number (contains only the digits 4 and 7).
   - The sum of the digits in the first half equals the sum of the digits in the second half.
2. Input consists of:
   - An even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) which is the length of the ticket number.
   - A ticket number which has exactly `n` digits.
3. The output should be "YES" if the ticket is lucky and "NO" otherwise.

### Provided Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())
    if sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Checking for Lucky Number**: The program does not check if all digits of the ticket number are either 4 or 7. This is a critical requirement according to the problem description.
2. **Sum Comparison Logic**: The way the sums are calculated has an off-by-one error because of the use of `n / 2 + n % 2` in the second sum; it should simply be `n / 2`. This means the program will incorrectly compare sums if `n` is even.
3. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to convert the digits into integers with `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, but leading zeros would be lost when converting to integers which is not a requirement according to the problem.

### Example Cases to Illustrate Issues:
- **Case 1**: Input `4` and `4747`
  - The number is lucky (all digits are lucky), but the sums would be calculated incorrectly due to the sum logic.
- **Case 2**: Input `4` and `1234`
  - The number is not lucky (contains digits other than 4 and 7), but the program would not handle this check.
- **Case 3**: Input `2` and `44`
  - The number is lucky (only contains 4), and the sums (4) would match, resulting in an incorrect output of "YES" when it should be "NO" on further checks.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a ticket is lucky due to missing checks for lucky digits and incorrect sum comparison logic.

Correctness: **False**.
