The function accepts a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and reads `m` floating-point numbers from input. It counts the occurrences of each number in the list and prints these counts as a space-separated string. The function does not handle invalid input formats or any conditions related to the string formatted as (a+b)/c, and it assumes all inputs are valid floating-point numbers.
