Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program attempts to read each jump coordinate as a float directly using `e = float(input())`. However, the input coordinates are given in the form of a string arithmetic expression (e.g., `(99+98)/97`). This string needs to be evaluated to compute the actual coordinate value. The current implementation ignores the format of the input and tries to convert it to a float directly, which will lead to a `ValueError`.

2. **Evaluation of Expression**: The problem requires the program to evaluate the arithmetic expression of the form `(a+b)/c` properly. The program does not contain any logic to parse and evaluate this expression correctly. Without this, the coordinates cannot be computed, and thus the subsequent steps to count occurrences would be based on incorrect or undefined values.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses `my_list.append(test_list.count(i))` to count occurrences of each coordinate in `test_list`. While this part is logically correct for counting occurrences if the coordinates were evaluated properly, the counts will be based on incorrect values due to the prior issues.

In summary, the program fails to parse the input correctly and evaluate the arithmetic expressions as required by the problem description, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors.
