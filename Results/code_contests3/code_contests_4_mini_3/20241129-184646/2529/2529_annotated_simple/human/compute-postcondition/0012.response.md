The code initializes an empty list `my_list`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers from input; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers from input; `my_list` is an empty list.**
