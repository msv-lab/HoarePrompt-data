According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will be 2.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
