`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts a floating-point number and `float` converts it to a float. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, and `e` is a floating-point number input.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, and `e` is a floating-point number input.**
