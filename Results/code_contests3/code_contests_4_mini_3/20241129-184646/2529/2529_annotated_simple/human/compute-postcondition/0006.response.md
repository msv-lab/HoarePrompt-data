The variable `e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, so the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a floating-point number from input.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a floating-point number from input.**
