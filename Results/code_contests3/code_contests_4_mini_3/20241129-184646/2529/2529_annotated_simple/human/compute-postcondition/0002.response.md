According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer and is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000), the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. The empty `test_list` does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop is solely dependent on `m`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
