The value of `e` is appended to `test_list`. The initial state does not provide any information about the current contents of `test_list`, but it is impacted by this operation. The variables `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a float input; `e` is appended to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a float input; `e` is appended to `test_list.**
