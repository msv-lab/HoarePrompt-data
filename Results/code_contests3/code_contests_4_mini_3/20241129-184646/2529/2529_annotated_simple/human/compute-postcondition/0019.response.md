The loop counts the occurrences of each floating-point number in `test_list` and appends these counts to `my_list`. Since `m` is a positive integer and `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, the loop will execute `m` times—once for each element in `test_list`. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `my_list` will contain `m` values, where each value corresponds to the count of the respective floating-point number in `test_list`. 

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is that `my_list` contains the counts of all elements in `test_list`, and `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is a list containing `m` floating-point numbers; `my_list` contains counts of occurrences of each corresponding floating-point number in `test_list`.**
