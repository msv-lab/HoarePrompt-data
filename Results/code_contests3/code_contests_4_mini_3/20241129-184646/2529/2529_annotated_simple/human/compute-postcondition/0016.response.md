The line of code `my_list.append(test_list.count(i))` appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. Given that `i` is equal to `m`, which is a positive integer within the specified range, the output state will reflect the count of `m` in `test_list`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; i` is `m`; `my_list` is updated with the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
