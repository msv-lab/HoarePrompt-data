The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates within the constraints that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, and that each jump coordinate is a string formatted as (a+b)/c where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. 

Given this context, the function processes these inputs internally and produces an output based on the defined criteria. However, since the specific outputs are not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the exact return values.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and jump coordinates formatted as (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
