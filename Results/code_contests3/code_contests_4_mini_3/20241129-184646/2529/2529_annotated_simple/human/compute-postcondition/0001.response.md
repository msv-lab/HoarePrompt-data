The variable `test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The assignment of `m` from `int(input())` does not affect `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**
