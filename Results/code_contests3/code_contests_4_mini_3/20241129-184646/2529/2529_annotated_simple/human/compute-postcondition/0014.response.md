The value of `i` is `m - 1`, which is the value of the first element of the `test_list`. The `count` method will count how many times the value of `i` appears in `test_list`. This count is then appended to `my_list`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `test_list`, and `my_list`) are not affected directly by this line of code, but `my_list` will now include the count of `i` from `test_list`. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` is a list containing `m` floating-point numbers; `my_list` now includes the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
