The loop reads `m` floating-point numbers from input and appends them to `test_list`. Since `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, the loop will execute exactly `m` times, collecting the input values.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following will be true:

- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000.
- `i` will be equal to `m - 1`, which is the last index used in the loop.
- `test_list` will contain exactly `m` floating-point numbers that were input during the loop execution.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers from input.**
