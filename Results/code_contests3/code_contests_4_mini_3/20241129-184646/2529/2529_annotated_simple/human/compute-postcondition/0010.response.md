The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `e` is a floating-point number input, and the previous values of `m` and `i` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `test_list` now includes the value of `e.**
