The loop iterates over each element in `test_list`, counting the occurrences of each element and appending that count to `my_list`. After the loop completes, `my_list` will contain the count of each element from `test_list` in the order they appeared. Since `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers based on user input, the total number of elements in `my_list` will equal `m`, with each element representing the count of the corresponding element from `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `my_list` contains the counts of each element in `test_list`, with a length of `m`.**
