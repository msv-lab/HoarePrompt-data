According to the code, the loop iterates over the `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least one element. Given that `m` is a positive integer and represents the number of elements in `test_list`, it is implied that if `m` is at least 1, `test_list` will also contain elements. 

The value of `i` is initially set to `m - 1`, but it will be overwritten by the first element of `test_list` when the loop starts. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed for the value of `i` prior to the loop, as it will be set to the first element of the list when the loop executes.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `m - 1`, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, for the loop to execute `test_list` must contain at least 1 floating-point number**
