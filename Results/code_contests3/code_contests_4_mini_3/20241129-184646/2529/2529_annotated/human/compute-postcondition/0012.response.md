The code initializes an empty list `my_list`. The other variables `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and the state of `test_list` is unaffected by the assignment of an empty list. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers based on user input; `my_list` is an empty list.**
