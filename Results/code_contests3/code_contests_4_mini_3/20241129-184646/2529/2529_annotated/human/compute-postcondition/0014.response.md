The code appends the count of the value `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The value of `i` is `m - 1`. Therefore, `my_list` will now include the number of occurrences of the value `m - 1` in `test_list`. 

The previous values are:
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers

Since `test_list` must contain at least 1 floating-point number, we can assume that it is not empty. The specific output state will depend on the actual contents of `test_list`, but since we are not provided with that, we simply state that the count of `i` has been appended to `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `m - 1`; `my_list` has been updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
