The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple lines of input based on the constraints provided. Each of the next `m` lines contains a valid arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. After executing the function body, it evaluates these expressions and returns the results. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept multiple valid arithmetic expressions and return their evaluated results.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the results of evaluating multiple valid arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers.**
