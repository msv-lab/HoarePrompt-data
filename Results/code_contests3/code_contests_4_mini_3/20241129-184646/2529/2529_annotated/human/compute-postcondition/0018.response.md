The code appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The variable `m` does not directly affect the execution of this line, but it indicates that the loop will execute if `test_list` has at least `m + 1` elements. The specific value of `i` and the contents of `test_list` are necessary to determine what value gets appended to `my_list`. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000; `i` is the next element in `test_list`; `my_list` has an updated count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000; `i` is the next element in `test_list`; `my_list` has an updated count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list.**
