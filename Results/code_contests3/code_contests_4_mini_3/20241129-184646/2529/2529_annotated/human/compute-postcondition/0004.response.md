The code appends the value of `e` to `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unaffected since no operations are performed on them. The output state will indicate the state of `m`, `i`, and the new state of `test_list` after appending `e`. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a floating-point number based on user input; `test_list` has `e` appended to it.**
