The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `e` is a float input, while the other variables `m` and `i` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the addition of `e` to `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` has `e` appended to it.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` has `e` appended to it.**
