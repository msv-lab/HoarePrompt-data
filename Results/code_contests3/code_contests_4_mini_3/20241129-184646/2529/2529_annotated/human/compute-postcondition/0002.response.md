According to the code, the loop will execute `m` times as long as `m` is a positive integer, which it is in this case (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000). Therefore, the loop will start with `i` initialized to 0 and will increment with each iteration until it reaches `m - 1`. Since `test_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself but could potentially be filled within the loop body if that is the intent.

To summarize, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be initialized to 0. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
