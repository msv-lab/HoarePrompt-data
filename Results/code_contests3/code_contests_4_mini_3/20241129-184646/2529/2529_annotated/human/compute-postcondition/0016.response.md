The code `my_list.append(test_list.count(i))` appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. The value of `i` is equal to `m`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. Since `test_list` has at least `m` elements, the count operation will return a non-negative integer based on how many times `m` appears in `test_list`. The specific value added to `my_list` depends on the contents of `test_list`, which is not provided.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the addition to `my_list` based on the count of `m` in `test_list`:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000; `i` is `m`; `my_list` has the count of `m` in `test_list` appended to it.**
