The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads an integer `m` from user input, which represents the number of subsequent lines of input. It then collects `m` floating-point numbers into a list called `test_list`. After that, it creates another list called `my_list` that counts the occurrences of each unique element in `test_list`. Finally, the function prints the counts as a space-separated string.

However, the function does not actually evaluate any arithmetic expressions, despite the initial annotations suggesting that it does. It simply collects floating-point numbers and counts their occurrences. Additionally, there is no handling of invalid input or potential errors, such as non-numeric input, which could lead to a runtime error.
