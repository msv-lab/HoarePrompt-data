According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**.
