Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input as floating-point numbers directly, which is incorrect. The problem description specifies that the input should be in the form of arithmetic expressions like `(a+b)/c`. The program needs to evaluate these expressions rather than treating them as floating-point numbers.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program does not perform any evaluation of the arithmetic expressions. Instead, it simply attempts to read and store them as floats, which leads to an incorrect representation of the coordinates that the ships will jump to. The correct approach would involve parsing the input to extract `a`, `b`, and `c` from the string and then calculating the result of the expression `(a+b)/c`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: While the program does count occurrences of the resulting coordinates, this counting is done based on the incorrect assumption that the inputs are already valid floating-point numbers. Since the expressions are not evaluated, the counts will not reflect the actual number of ships ending up at the same coordinate.

4. **Output Format**: The output itself is generated based on the incorrect counts from the flawed input handling, meaning that the final output would not align with the expected results provided in the example.

In summary, the program fails to interpret the input correctly, does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions as required, and thus cannot produce the correct counts for the ship coordinates. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements.
