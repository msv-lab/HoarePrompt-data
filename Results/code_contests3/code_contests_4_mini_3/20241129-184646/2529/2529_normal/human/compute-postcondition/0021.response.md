The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. However, it operates based on the constraints that `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and each jump coordinate must be a valid arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.

The function's output is not specifically detailed in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes the jump coordinates and `m` in some manner. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `m` in the range of 1 to 200,000 and valid jump coordinates expressed as (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The output is determined based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed.**
