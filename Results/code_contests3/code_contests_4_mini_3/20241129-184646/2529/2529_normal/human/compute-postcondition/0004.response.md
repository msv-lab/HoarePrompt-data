`test_list` is extended by appending the value of `e` to it. The previous values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and `test_list` now includes the new value of `e`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a floating-point input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a floating-point input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e**.
