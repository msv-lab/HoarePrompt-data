According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, the loop can execute for `m` values of at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the current loop index, which starts at 0 and goes up to `m-1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `i` must be initialized to 0, and since `test_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
