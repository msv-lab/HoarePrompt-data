According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the `test_list` has more elements remaining for `i` to take on, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `test_list`, and `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` would then be the third element in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `my_list` now contains the count of occurrences of `i`, for the loop to execute a third time `test_list` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `test_list`.**
