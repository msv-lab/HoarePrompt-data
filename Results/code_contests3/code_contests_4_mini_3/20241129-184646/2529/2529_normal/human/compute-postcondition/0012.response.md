The code initializes `my_list` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables have not changed, and no calculations are done. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `m` and the initialization of `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `my_list` is an empty list**.
