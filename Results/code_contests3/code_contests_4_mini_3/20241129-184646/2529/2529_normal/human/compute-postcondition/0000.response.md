`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `m` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000 and `m` is now updated based on the input.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000 and `m` is now updated based on the input.**
