The variable `test_list` is initialized as an empty list. There are no other variables affected, and the previous value of `m` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**.
