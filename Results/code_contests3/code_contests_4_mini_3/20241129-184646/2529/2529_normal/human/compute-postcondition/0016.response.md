The `my_list` is modified by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The value of `i` is the second element in `test_list`, and `test_list.count(i)` counts how many times `i` appears in `test_list`. The variable `m` and the count operation do not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `my_list` with the new count appended.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `my_list` now contains the count of occurrences of `i` appended; `i` is the second element in `test_list`.**
