The code `test_list.append(e)` adds the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `test_list`, but it is implied that `test_list` exists and can hold values. The other variables (`m` and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `e` to `test_list`, while `m` and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `e` is a float input; `e` has been appended to `test_list`.**
