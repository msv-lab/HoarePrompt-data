According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least one element. Currently, `my_list` is an empty list, which means `test_list` also needs to contain elements. 

Since `m` is a positive integer, it could be used to populate `test_list` if we assume `m` indicates the number of elements to be added. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_list` should be initialized with at least one element, and `i` should be set to the first element in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `my_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `test_list` must contain at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `test_list`**.
