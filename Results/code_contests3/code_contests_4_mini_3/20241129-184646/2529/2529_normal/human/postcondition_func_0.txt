The function accepts a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) representing the number of subsequent floating-point inputs. It then reads `m` floating-point numbers from the input and counts the occurrences of each unique number in that list, returning a space-separated string of these counts corresponding to the order of the original inputs. The function does not handle edge cases such as invalid input types or values outside the specified range.
