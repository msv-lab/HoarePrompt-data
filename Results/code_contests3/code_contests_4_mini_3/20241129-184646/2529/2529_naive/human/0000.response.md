The provided program is intended to read a number of ships and their jump coordinates, calculate those coordinates from the given arithmetic expressions, and then determine how many ships will end up at the same coordinate.

However, the program has a major flaw: it reads the input as a float directly without evaluating the arithmetic expression. This means that it does not correctly parse the input in the form of `(a+b)/c`. Instead, it will throw an error when trying to convert the arithmetic expression directly into a float. Thus, it cannot handle the input as specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
(99+98)/97
```
The program will attempt to do `float("(99+98)/97")`, which will raise a `ValueError`, as this is not a valid float input.

Additionally, even if the input were parsed correctly, the method used to count occurrences does not properly handle the potential for different coordinates that may yield the same float result due to floating-point precision issues.

Therefore, it is clear that the program does not fulfill the requirements as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
