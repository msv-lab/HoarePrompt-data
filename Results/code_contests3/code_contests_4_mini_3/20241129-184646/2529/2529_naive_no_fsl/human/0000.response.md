Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to read each arithmetic expression as a `float` directly, which will not work for the input format of `(a+b)/c`. 

To elaborate, the expected input is in the form of arithmetic expressions like `(99+98)/97`, but the program reads this input and treats it as a floating-point number without evaluating the expression. This will lead to a `ValueError` when trying to convert the input string directly to a `float`, because the string contains characters that cannot be parsed as a float (like parentheses and the plus sign).

Additionally, the program does not account for possible simplification of the expressions, which is required to determine if two ships end up in the same coordinates. It should evaluate the expression `(a+b)/c` to a single numerical value before counting occurrences.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
(1+2)/3
(3+6)/9
(2+1)/3
```
The expected output should show the counts of ships going to the same coordinates. However, the program will fail at the input stage due to the invalid conversion attempt.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
