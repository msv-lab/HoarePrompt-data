#State of the program right berfore the function call: k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000, where k is the maximum number of sections in a box, a is the number of nuts, b is the number of divisors, and v is the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the number of iterations executed, and `k` is between 2 and 1000, while `v` is between 1 and 1000.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer inputs `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` where `k` is the maximum number of sections in a box, `a` is the number of nuts, `b` is the number of divisors, and `v` is the capacity of each section. It calculates how many iterations are required to fit all the nuts into the box sections based on the number of available sections and the number of divisors. The function returns the total number of iterations needed to reduce the number of nuts (`a`) to zero or below. If there are not enough sections or capacity, it will continue until all nuts are allocated or exhausted. The function does not handle any potential errors or checks for invalid input values outside the specified ranges.
