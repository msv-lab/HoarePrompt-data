Postcondition: ***`k` is between 2 and 1000, `b` is less than or equal to 0, and `v` is between 1 and 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by at least 1, `res` is increased by 1, and `a` is decreased by `k * v`. Otherwise, `res` is increased by 1, and if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `1 * v`; otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
