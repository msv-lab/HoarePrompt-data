Postcondition: ***`k` is between 2 and 1000; if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `v` is between 1 and 1000; otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `b` is updated to 0 and `a` is modified, while if `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` remains less than or equal to its original value, `b` is less than or equal to 0, and `res` is 1, with `v` remaining between 1 and 1000.***
