Postcondition: ***`k` is between 2 and 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is between 1 and 1000, `res` is incremented by 1, and `a` is updated by subtracting `k * v`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `res` is incremented by 1 and `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `res` is incremented by 1, and `a` is decremented by `v`.***
