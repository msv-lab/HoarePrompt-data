The value of `b` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `k`, `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is unchanged; `a` is decreased by `(0 + 1) * v`, which simplifies to `a` is decreased by `v`; `b` is 0; `v` is an integer; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is unchanged; `a` is decreased by `v`; `b` is 0; `v` is an integer; `res` is increased by 1**
