Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than `k` but greater than 0, then `a` is updated and `b` is set to 0, with `res` increased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains unchanged, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
