Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is modified to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is 1. Otherwise, if `b` > 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, then `a` is modified to `a - v`, while `b` remains unchanged, and `res` remains 1.***
