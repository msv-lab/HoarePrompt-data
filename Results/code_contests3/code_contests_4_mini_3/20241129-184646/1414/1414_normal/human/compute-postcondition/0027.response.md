The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. The values of `k`, `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is an integer; `res` is increased by 1; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`.

Output State: **`k`, `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is an integer; `res` is increased by 1; `a` is updated to `a - k * v**
