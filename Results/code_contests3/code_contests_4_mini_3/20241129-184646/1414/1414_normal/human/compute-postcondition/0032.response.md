Postcondition: ***`k`, `a` are greater than 0, if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is an integer, `res` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated to `a - k * v`. If `b` is less than `k`, and greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` and `res` is increased by 1; otherwise, `k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged, `a` is updated to `a - v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
