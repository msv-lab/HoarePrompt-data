The code assigns the value `0` to `b`, which affects only the variable `b`. The other variables (`k`, `a`, `v`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer, `a` is an updated integer, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `a` is an updated integer, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is increased by 1**
