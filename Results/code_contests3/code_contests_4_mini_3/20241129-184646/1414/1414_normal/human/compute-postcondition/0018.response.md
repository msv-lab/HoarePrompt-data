The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from its previous value. The previous values of `b` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b` after the operation. The values of `a` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `res` is increased by 1; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `res` is increased by 1; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`.**
