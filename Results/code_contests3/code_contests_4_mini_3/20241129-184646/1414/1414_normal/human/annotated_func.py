#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the number of times the loop executed, with `k`, `v` remaining unchanged.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, representing the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section, respectively. It calculates how many iterations are needed to process all nuts based on the given constraints, specifically how many nuts can be placed in the sections until none are left. The function does not include checks for invalid input ranges or error messages related to the capacity of sections or the number of divisors, but it will return the count of iterations until all nuts are accounted for.
