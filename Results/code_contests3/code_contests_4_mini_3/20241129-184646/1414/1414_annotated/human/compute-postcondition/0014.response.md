Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `b` is set to 0, `a` is updated, and `res` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b` is 0 or less, `a` is updated to `a - v`, and even though `b` cannot logically be less than or equal to 0 in a valid state, `res` remains 1.***
