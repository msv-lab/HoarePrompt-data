The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from its current value. The value of `k` is between 2 and 1000, which means `(k - 1)` is at least 1 and at most 999. Therefore, `b` will decrease by at least 1 and at most 999, but remains an integer between 1 and 1000. The other variables, `a`, `v`, and `res`, are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the Output State reflects the change in `b`:

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a` is updated to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `res` is increased by 1.**
