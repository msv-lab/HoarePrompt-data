Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000. If `b` > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0, while `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains an integer with 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, `v` is an integer with 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
