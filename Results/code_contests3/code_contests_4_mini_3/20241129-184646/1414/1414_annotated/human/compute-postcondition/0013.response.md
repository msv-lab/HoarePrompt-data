Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000), if `b` > 0, then `b` is set to 0 and `a` is updated while `res` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b` is 0 or less, `a` is updated to `a - v`, and since `b` cannot be less than or equal to 0 in a valid state, this case implies that the condition is inconsistent but `res` remains 1.***
