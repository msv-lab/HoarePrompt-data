Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by a value between 1 and 999. If `b` is less than `k`, and if `b` is greater than 0, then `b` is set to 0 and `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
