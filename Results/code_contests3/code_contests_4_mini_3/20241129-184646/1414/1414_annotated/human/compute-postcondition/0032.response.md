Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers with 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000. If `b` >= `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `b` > 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is 0 or negative, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains unchanged, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
