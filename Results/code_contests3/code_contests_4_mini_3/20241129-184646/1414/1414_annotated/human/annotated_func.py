#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the number of times the loop executed, and the values of `k` and `v` remain unchanged within their specified ranges (2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000).
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000). It simulates the process of distributing `a` nuts into sections of a box with a maximum of `k` sections, each with a capacity of `v`. The function counts and returns the number of iterations it takes to deplete all nuts `a`, adjusting the number of nuts based on the number of divisors `b` and the maximum sections `k`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, it deducts `k * v` nuts; if `b` is positive but less than `k`, it deducts `(b + 1) * v` nuts; otherwise, it deducts `v` nuts. The function continues in a loop until `a` is less than or equal to 0.
