The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The value of `result` prior to this operation is unknown, and since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, it does not directly affect `result`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `result` is increased by 1**
