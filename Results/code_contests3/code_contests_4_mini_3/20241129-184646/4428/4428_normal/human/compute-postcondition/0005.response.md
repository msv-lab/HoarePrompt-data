`result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes 1. The states of the other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `S` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `S` is 'I'.**
