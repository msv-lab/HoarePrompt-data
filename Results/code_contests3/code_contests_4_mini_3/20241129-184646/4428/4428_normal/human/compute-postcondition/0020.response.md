Postcondition: ***`result` is equal to the difference between the number of 'I' characters and the number of 'D' characters in string `S`; if `result` is less than 0, then `result` is 0, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.***
