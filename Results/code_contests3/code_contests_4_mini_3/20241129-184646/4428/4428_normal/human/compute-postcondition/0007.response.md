The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since `result` was initially 0, it becomes -1 after the operation. The values of the other variables (`N`, `i`, and `S[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and `S[i]` is not equal to 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and `S[i]` is not equal to 'I'**.
