`N` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, its value will be determined by user input. The string `S` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
