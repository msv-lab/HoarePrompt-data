The code `result -= 1` decrements the value of `result` by 1. The value of `result` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be decreased by 1 regardless of its previous value. The other variables `N` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` must be equal to `N` for the loop to execute one more time, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` must be equal to `N` for the loop to execute one more time, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
