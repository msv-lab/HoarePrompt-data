The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I' characters and 'D' characters in `S`. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0 before printing it. The function does not return a value, but it outputs the final result.
