The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It counts the number of 'I' characters in `S`, subtracts the number of 'D' characters from it, and ensures that the result is not negative (setting it to 0 if it is). Finally, it prints the resulting value. The function does not return any value, as it only outputs the result.
