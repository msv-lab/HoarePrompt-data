According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as the current index `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is less than `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and given that `i` must be less than `N` for the loop to continue, we can conclude that if the loop executes again, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Thus, the next state will reflect that `i` is now one step closer to `N`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `N`.**
