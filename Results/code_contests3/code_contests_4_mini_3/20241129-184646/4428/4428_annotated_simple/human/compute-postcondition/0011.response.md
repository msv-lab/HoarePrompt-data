The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The specific previous value of `result` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The variable `i` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `result` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `result` has been decremented by 1**
