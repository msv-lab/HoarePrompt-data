The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it is affected by the increment. The values of other variables, `N` and `i`, are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, and `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, and `result` is incremented by 1**
