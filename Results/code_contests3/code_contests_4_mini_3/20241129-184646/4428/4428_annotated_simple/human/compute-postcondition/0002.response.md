The variable `result` is initialized with the value 0. The values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is now a string from user input; `result` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is now a string from user input; `result` is 0**
