`result` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is unknown. The value of `i` is still incremented by 1, but since it must be less than `N` for the loop to execute one more time, it is implied that the loop will continue if this condition holds. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `result` without affecting `N` or the condition for `i`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `result` is decremented by 1.**
