The code snippet `result += 1` increments the value of `result` by 1. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer and that `i` will be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time, but the exact values of `result` and `i` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `result` is increased by 1 without knowing the previous value.

Output State: **`result` is increased by 1**
