The variable `S` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input()`, which takes user input. The previous state of `S`, which is a string of length `N`, will be replaced by the new input string. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is now a string from user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is now a string from user input.**
