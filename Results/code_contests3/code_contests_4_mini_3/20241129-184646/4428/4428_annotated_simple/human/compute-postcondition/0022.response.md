The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on two predefined constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function generates a sequence based on the characters in the string `S` and returns a list of integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D' characters to produce a corresponding list of integers. 

Functionality: **The function processes a string S of length N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) consisting of 'I' and 'D' characters and returns a list of integers based on that string.**
