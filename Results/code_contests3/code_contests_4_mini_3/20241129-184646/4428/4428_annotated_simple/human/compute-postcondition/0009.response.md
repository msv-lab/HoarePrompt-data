According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 1` and `i` will be `i + 1`.**
