The variable `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means `N` will be a positive integer as per the initial state condition (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
