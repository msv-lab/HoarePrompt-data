The value of `result` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it is affected by the operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `result` has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `result` has been decreased by 1.**
