Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. If the character at index `i` in `S` is 'I', `result` is incremented by 1 and `i` is now greater than its previous value and less than `N`. Otherwise, `result` is decreased by 1, and `i` is now `i + 1`, while for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must still be less than `N`.***
