The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` has already been incremented to `i + 1`, and since `i` must be less than `N` for the loop to execute a second time, we continue with this condition. The state of `N` is not directly affected, and we assume `result` is being updated based on the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is incremented by 1, `i` is now greater than its previous value and less than `N`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `result` is incremented by 1, `i` is now greater than its previous value and less than `N`**
