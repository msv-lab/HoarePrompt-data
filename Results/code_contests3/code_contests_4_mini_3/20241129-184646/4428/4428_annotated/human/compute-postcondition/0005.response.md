`result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes 1. The values of `N`, `i`, and the character at index `i` of string `S` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `result` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `S` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `result` is 1, and the character at index `i` of string `S` is 'I'**
