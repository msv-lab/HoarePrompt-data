According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. Since `i` must be less than `N` for the loop to execute again, we need to consider how `i` has changed after the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was greater than its previous value and still less than `N`. 

If `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will be one unit larger than it was at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute for a second time, `i` must be less than `N`, which implies that `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `i` is now `i + 1`, we can conclude:

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is now `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must still be less than `N`.**
