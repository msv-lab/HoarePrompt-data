The function `func` accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` that consists only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates a `result` by counting the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string `S`. Specifically, it increments `result` for each 'I' and decrements it for each 'D'. After processing the string, if the `result` is negative, it resets `result` to 0 before printing it. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to compute the net count of 'I's minus 'D's and ensure that the output is non-negative.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D', calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's, and prints the result, ensuring it is non-negative. **
