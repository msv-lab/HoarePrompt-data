The value of `result` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `result` is -1, and the first element of `S` at index `i` is not 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `result` is -1, and the first element of `S` at index `i` is not 'I'.**
