The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, it will take a specific integer value provided by the user input. The string `S` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
