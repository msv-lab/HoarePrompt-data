The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it will now be increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`N` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `result` is increased by 1.**
