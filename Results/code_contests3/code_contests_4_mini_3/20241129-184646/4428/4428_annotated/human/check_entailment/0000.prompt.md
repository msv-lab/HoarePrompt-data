You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have an integer variable x. Initially, x=0.

Some person gave you a string S of length N, and using the string you performed the following operation N times. In the i-th operation, you incremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`I`, and decremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`D`.

Find the maximum value taken by x during the operations (including before the first operation, and after the last operation).

Constraints

* 1≤N≤100
* |S|=N
* No characters except `I` and `D` occur in S.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the maximum value taken by x during the operations.

Examples

Input

5
IIDID


Output

2


Input

7
DDIDDII


Output

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    S = raw_input()
    result = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'I':
            result += 1
        else:
            result -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the count of 'I' characters in `S` minus the count of 'D' characters in `S`, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.
    if (result < 0) :
        result = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`result` is equal to the count of 'I' characters in `S` minus the count of 'D' characters in `S`, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. If `result` was less than 0, then `result` is 0.
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D', calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's, and prints the result, ensuring it is non-negative.

The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
