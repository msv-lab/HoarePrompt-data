You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently Luba bought a very interesting book. She knows that it will take t seconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.

But she has some work to do in each of n next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during i-th day is ai. If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.

Help Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.

It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed n.

Remember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t ≤ 106) — the number of days and the time required to read the book.

The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) — the time Luba has to spend on her work during i-th day.

Output

Print the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.

It is guaranteed that answer doesn't exceed n.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and a is a list of n integers where each integer ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend working on the i-th day.
def func():
    n, t = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    a = raw_input().split()
    i = 0
    while t > 0:
        t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is less than or equal to `0`, `i` is equal to the minimum of `n` and the number of iterations executed, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values.
    print(i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` (the number of days) and `t` (the total time in seconds available to work), and a list of `n` integers representing the time in seconds Luba can work on each day. It calculates how many days Luba can work before the total time `t` runs out, and returns the count of days worked. If `t` becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop stops, and the function prints the number of days worked, which may be less than `n` if `t` runs out before all days are accounted for.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
