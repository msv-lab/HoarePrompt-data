Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read the input, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **List Conversion**: The program reads `a` as a list of strings but does not convert them to integers. The line `a = raw_input().split()` should be `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` to ensure that `a` contains integers.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop condition `while t > 0:` is correct in spirit but the way it handles the decrement of `t` is flawed. The program is subtracting `86400 - int(a[i])`, which means it is incorrectly calculating the time available for reading. Instead, it should correctly calculate the free time available for reading on each day as `86400 - a[i]`.

4. **Index Out of Range**: The loop does not include a check to ensure `i` does not exceed `n - 1`, which could lead to an `IndexError` if `t` does not become less than or equal to `0` before exhausting the days.

5. **End Condition**: The program should print the day on which Luba finishes reading, but it currently prints `i`, which represents the number of days worked, not the specific day number.

To correct the program, the loop should iterate through the days, calculate the free time for reading, and keep track of the days until the required reading time `t` is met or exceeded. The output should reflect the minimum day Luba finishes reading, which is the day corresponding to `i` when the loop exits due to `t` being less than or equal to `0`.

In summary, the program's logic and implementation do not fully align with the requirements specified in the problem description.
