The value of `i` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the other variables `n`, `t`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `i` only. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 0**
