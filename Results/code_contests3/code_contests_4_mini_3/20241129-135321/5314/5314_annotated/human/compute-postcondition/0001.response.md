The code assigns the variable `a` the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. Given that `n` is an integer representing the number of days and the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers, this means that the initial input will determine the size of the list `a`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the list `a` will now hold the string representations of the integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values.**
