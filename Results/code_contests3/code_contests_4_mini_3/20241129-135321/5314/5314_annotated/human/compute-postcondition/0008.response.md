The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is adjusted to be greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 2; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[1])`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is adjusted to be greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 2; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[1])**
