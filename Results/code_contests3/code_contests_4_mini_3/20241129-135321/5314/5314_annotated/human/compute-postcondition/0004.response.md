The value of `t` is decremented by the result of `86400 - int(a[i])`. Here, `int(a[i])` is the integer conversion of the `i`-th string in list `a`. The previous value of `t` is not specified, but it remains an integer within its defined range. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, though `i` remains at 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 0**
