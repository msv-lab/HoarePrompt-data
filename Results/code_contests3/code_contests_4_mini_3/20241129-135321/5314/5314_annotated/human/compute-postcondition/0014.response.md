The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of days. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, representing a total time constraint in seconds. Additionally, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend working on the i-th day. 

The function evaluates the provided parameters and, based on the relationship between `n`, `t`, and the elements of list `a`, it returns a result that reflects the feasibility of Luba's work schedule within the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of `n` integers `a`, and evaluates Luba's work schedule based on the provided time constraints.**
