Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 86400) represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend working on the `i`-th day; `n` and `t` are assigned values from `raw_input()` split and converted to integers.**
