The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is adjusted to be greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 3; `t` is updated to be `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is adjusted to be greater than `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of `n` strings representing input values; `i` is 3; `t` is updated to be `t - (86400 - int(a[2]))**
