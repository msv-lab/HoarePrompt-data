Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` (the number of days) and `t` (the total time in seconds available to work), and a list of `n` integers representing the time in seconds Luba can work on each day. It calculates how many days Luba can work before the total time `t` runs out, and returns the count of days worked. If `t` becomes less than or equal to 0, the loop stops, and the function prints the number of days worked, which may be less than `n` if `t` runs out before all days are accounted for. **
