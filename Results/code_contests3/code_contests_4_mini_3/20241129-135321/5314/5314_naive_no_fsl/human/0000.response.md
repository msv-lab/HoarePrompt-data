To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and identify any potential issues.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Luba has `n` days to read a book that takes `t` seconds.
- Each day, she has `a[i]` seconds of work, which means she has `86400 - a[i]` seconds available for reading.
- The task is to determine the minimum day when Luba finishes reading the book.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()`. However, let's assume the environment supports `raw_input()`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues while `t > 0`. This could lead to an `IndexError` if `i` exceeds `n - 1`. The program does not check if there are remaining days before accessing `a[i]`.

3. **Day Counting**: The program increments `i` and prints it after the loop. However, if the loop exits when `t` is still greater than 0 (because `i` exceeds the number of available days), it will print `n + 1` on the last iteration which is incorrect since it would imply an extra day that doesnâ€™t exist.

### Test Cases to Consider:
- **Test Case 1**: If `n = 3`, `t = 86400`, and `a = [0, 86400, 0]`, the program would access `a[2]` and could either finish on day 1 or cause an index error.
- **Test Case 2**: If `n = 2`, `t = 100000`, and `a = [86400, 86400]`, the program would loop indefinitely without finishing since it would keep trying to access `a[i]` beyond the bounds.

### Conclusion:
Given these issues, particularly the potential for an `IndexError` and incorrect day counting, the program does not handle all potential input cases correctly.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly manage the case where the number of days is insufficient for completing the reading, nor does it handle the case when the index of `a` exceeds its bounds.
