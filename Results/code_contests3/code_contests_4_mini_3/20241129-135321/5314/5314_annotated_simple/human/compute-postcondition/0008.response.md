The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[i])`, `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from input, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[i])`, `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from input, `i` is 2**
