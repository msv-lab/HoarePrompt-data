Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400). It iteratively decrements `t` by the difference of 86400 and the current element of the list `a` until `t` becomes less than or equal to 0 or all elements of `a` have been processed. The function then prints the number of iterations executed, which corresponds to the number of elements processed from `a` before `t` is exhausted or all elements are used. If `t` is insufficient to process all `n` elements in `a`, it will print the count of how many elements were processed before `t` became non-positive.**
