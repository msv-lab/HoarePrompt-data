The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input. However, it involves the following constraints and relationships: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^6\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 86400\). 

Since the output conditions are not specified, I will assume the function computes some result based on these constraints. However, without specific output cases given, I can only summarize the accepted parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400). The function processes these inputs to produce a result based on the defined logic.**
