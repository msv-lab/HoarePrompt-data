The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[i])`; `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from input; `i` is 3; and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.
