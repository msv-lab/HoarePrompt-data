The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `i` is 0, this operation affects the first element of the list `a`. The value of `a[i]` will be an integer from the list `a`. Therefore, the new value of `t` will be `t - (86400 - int(a[0]))`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[0])`, `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from input, `i` is 0**
