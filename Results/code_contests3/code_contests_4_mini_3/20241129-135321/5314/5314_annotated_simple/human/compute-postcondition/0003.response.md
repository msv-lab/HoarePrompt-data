According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6. Since `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute the first time without needing any adjustments. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, `a` is assigned a list of `n` integers from input, `i` is 0**
