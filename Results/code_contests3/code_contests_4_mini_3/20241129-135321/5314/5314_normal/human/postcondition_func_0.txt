The function accepts two integers `n` and `t`, and a list of `n` integers representing the time Luba has to work each day. It calculates how many days can be processed before the total available time `t` becomes non-positive, by decrementing `t` with the difference between 86400 (total seconds in a day) and each day's work time. The function returns the count of how many days were processed before `t` runs out. If `t` starts high enough, it may process all `n` days; if `t` is low, it may process fewer. However, it does not handle cases where the list `a` has fewer elements than `n`, leading to potential index errors if `t` does not become non-positive before the list is exhausted.
