The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The value of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1**
