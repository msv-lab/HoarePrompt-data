The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on the following constraints:

1. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
2. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^6\).
3. `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each \(a_i\) (with \(0 \leq a_i \leq 86400\)) represents the time Luba has to spend working on the i-th day.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the context, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on the constraints and relationships of the input values.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list `ai` of `n` integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), where it returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
