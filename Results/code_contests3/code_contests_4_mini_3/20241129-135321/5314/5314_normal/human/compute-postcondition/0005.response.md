The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `ai`, `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[0])`; `ai` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of strings from the split input; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[0])`; `ai` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of strings from the split input; `i` is 1**
