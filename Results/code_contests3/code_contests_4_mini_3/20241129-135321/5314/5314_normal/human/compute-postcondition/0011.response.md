`i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1**
