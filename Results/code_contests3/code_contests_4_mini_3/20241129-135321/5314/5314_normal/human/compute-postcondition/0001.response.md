The line `a = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This affects the variable `a`, which will now hold a list of strings representing the input values. The previous values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line. The variable `ai` is also not directly affected since `a` is a new variable that holds the split input. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of strings from the split input.**
