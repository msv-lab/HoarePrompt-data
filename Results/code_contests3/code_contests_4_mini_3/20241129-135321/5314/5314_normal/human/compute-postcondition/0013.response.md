Output State: **`t` is decremented by the total of `86400 - int(a[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`; `i` is the count of how many iterations the loop executed, which is equal to the number of elements processed from list `a` until `t` becomes non-positive; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ai` is a list of `n` integers; the value of `i` is printed.**
