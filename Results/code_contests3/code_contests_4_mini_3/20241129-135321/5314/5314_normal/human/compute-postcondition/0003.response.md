According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6, which ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without any adjustments. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers; `a` is a list of strings from the split input; `i` is 0**
