Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem asks for a program that extracts and prints the diagonal elements from a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. However, the program appears to deal with integer inputs and calculations, which is completely unrelated to the task at hand.

For example, if we provide the input:

```
abc
def
ghi
```

The expected output should be:

```
agi
```

But the current program will not handle this input correctly, as it is built to work with integers rather than characters in a grid. The program's logic is irrelevant to the problem description, thus demonstrating that it does not fulfill the requirements. 

Therefore, because the program does not operate correctly for the expected input, the correctness is False.
