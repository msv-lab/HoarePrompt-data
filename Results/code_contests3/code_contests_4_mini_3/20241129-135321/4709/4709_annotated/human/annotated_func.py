#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing exactly three lowercase English letters, representing a 3×3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`, `ans` is the count of integers in the range from `int(A)` to `int(B)` that satisfy the condition where the first character of the string representation of the integer is equal to the fifth character and the second character is equal to the fourth character, `i` is `int(B) - 1`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i` if the loop executed at least once, otherwise `ans` remains 1 if `int(A) >= int(B)`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three lines of input, each containing three lowercase English letters, and treats the first two lines as integers A and B. It initializes a counter `ans` to 0. If A equals B, it sets `ans` to 1. It then counts how many integers exist in the range from A to B (exclusive) that, when converted to a string, have the first and fifth characters equal and the second and fourth characters equal. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. If A is greater than or equal to B, the function will print 1 as there will be no integers in the range to count. However, the function does not actually process a 3×3 grid; it only uses the first two inputs as integer values.
