The variable `a` is assigned a string of three lowercase English letters. The code `l = a.split()` takes the string `a` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. However, since `a` is a string of three lowercase letters with no spaces, the resulting list `l` will contain a single element, which is the entire string `a`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`**
