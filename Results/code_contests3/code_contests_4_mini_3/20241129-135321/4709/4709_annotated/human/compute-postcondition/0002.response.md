`A` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `l`, which contains the single element `a`. Since `l` only has one element, `A` will be equal to `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`**
