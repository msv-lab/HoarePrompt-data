Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented to 2 if the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`. The loop executes the first time `int(A) < int(B)`, `i` is `int(A)`, and `C` is a list of string characters derived from the integer value of `i`.***
