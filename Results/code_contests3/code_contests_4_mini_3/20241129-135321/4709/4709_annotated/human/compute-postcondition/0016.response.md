Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the single element `a`, `A` is equal to `a`, if the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is incremented to 3, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. There is no else part in the code.***
