The function accepts three strings, which are expected to represent integers in string format. It counts how many integers exist between the integer values of the first two strings (inclusive of the first and exclusive of the second) such that the first character equals the fifth character and the second character equals the fourth character when the integer is converted to a string. If the two integers represented by the first two strings are equal, it initializes the count to 1. The function prints this count but does not return any value.
