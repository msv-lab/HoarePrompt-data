Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` split by whitespace; `A` is the first element of the list `l` and `B` is the second element of the list `l`. If `int(A)` is equal to `int(B)`, then `ans` is set to 1 and `A` and `B` are integers that are equal.***
