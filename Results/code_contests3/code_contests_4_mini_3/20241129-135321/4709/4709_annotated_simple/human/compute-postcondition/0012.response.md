Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` split by whitespace; `A` is the first element of the list `l`; `B` is not defined; `i` is initialized to `int(A)`; `C` is not assigned, and since `C[0]`, `C[1]`, `C[3]`, and `C[4]` cannot be evaluated, the condition cannot be satisfied, and `ans` remains undefined as `ans += 1` cannot be executed.***
