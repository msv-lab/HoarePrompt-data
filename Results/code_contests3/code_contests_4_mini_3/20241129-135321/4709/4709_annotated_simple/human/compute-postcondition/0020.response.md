Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` split by whitespace; `A` is the first element of the list `l`; `B` is defined and greater than `A`; `i` is `int(A) + 2; C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` equals `C[4]` and `C[1]` equals `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
