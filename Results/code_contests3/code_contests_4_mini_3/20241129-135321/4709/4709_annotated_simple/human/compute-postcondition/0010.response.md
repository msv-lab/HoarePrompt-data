Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of length 3 containing lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the elements of `a` split by whitespace; `A` is the first element of the list `l`; `B` is not defined; `i` is initialized to `int(A)`; `C` is not assigned; the first element of `C` is equal to the fifth element of `C`, and the second element of `C` is equal to the fourth element of `C` (although `C` is not defined, this condition implies that `C` would need to be defined for its elements to satisfy these conditions).***
