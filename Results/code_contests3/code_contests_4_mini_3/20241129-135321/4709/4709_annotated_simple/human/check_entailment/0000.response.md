The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` (which is not valid in Python 3; it should be `input()`) and attempts to split the input based on whitespace. However, the problem description specifies that the input is given as three lines of three characters each, without any whitespace separating them. The program does not correctly read the input as specified.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The program is trying to compare two variables `A` and `B` as integers, which are assigned from the strings. This logic is entirely irrelevant to the task of extracting the diagonal from a 3x3 grid of characters. The diagonal elements should be accessed directly based on their positions in the grid.

3. **Output**: The program attempts to print a count (`ans`) of certain conditions met within a for loop, which is not required by the problem description. The output should be a string formed by concatenating the diagonal elements, not a count of integers.

4. **Diagonal Extraction**: The program does not have any implementation to extract the characters from the diagonal of the 3x3 grid. According to the problem, it should concatenate `c_{11}`, `c_{22}`, and `c_{33}` to form the output string.

In conclusion, the program does not implement the requirements of the problem description correctly and fails in multiple areas, leading to the determination of correctness as **False**.
