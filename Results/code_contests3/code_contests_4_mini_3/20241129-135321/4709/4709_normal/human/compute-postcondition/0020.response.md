Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is either 2 or 3. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character and the second character is equal to the fourth character, then `ans` is set to 2 or 3. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `ans` and the other variables remain as described.***
