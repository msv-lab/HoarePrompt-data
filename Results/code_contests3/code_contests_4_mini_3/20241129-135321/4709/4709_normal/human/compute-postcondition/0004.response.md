The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, and `ans` is 0**.
