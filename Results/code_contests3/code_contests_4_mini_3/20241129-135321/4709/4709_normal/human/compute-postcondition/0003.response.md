The variable `B` is assigned the value of the second substring from the list `l`, which is `l[1]`. The value of `l` is derived from splitting the string `a`, and while `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` will take the value of the substring at index 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, and `B` is the second substring from `l`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`.**
