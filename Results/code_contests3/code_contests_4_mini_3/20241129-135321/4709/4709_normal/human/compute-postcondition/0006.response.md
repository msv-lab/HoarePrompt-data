`ans` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `ans` was 0, so now `ans` is updated to 1. The states of other variables, including `a`, `l`, `A`, and `B`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is 1, and the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is 1, and the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B.**
