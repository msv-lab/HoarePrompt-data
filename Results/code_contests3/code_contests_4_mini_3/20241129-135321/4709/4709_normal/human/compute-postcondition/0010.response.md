Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `i` is initialized to `int(A)`; `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`; the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C`, and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`.***
