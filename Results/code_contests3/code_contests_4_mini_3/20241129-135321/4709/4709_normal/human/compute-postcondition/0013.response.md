According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `A` and `B`. The loop iterates over a range that starts from `int(A)` and goes up to `int(B)`. If `i` is less than `int(B)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is initialized to `int(A)`, which is the starting point of the range. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was equal to `int(A)`, after the next iteration `i` will be `int(A) + 1`. The loop can continue as long as `int(A) + 1` is less than `int(B)`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state must reflect that `i` is now `int(A) + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 1`.

State: **`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `i` is `int(A) + 1`; for the loop to execute again, `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 1`**
