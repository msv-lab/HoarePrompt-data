Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
