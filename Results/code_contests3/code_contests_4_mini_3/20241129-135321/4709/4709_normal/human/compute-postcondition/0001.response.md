`l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `a` remains unchanged. The output state will reflect the new variable `l` holding the list of substrings. 

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a row of the grid from the input; `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`**.
