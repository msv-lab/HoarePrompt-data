Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, and `ans` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, the value of `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
