The function accepts two integer values as input (formatted as strings) from a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters and counts how many integers between those two values (exclusive) are symmetric, based on their character representation. If the two integers are equal, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count of symmetric integers. However, the function does not return any specific output; it only prints the count. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers, which could lead to runtime errors.
