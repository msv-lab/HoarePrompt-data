#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, formatted as three strings of length 3, each representing a row of the grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first substring from `l`, `B` is the second substring from `l`, `ans` is the count of integers between `int(A)` and `int(B)` (exclusive) that meet the symmetry condition, or remains 1 if `int(A)` equals `int(B)`, otherwise remains 0 if the loop does not execute.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer values as input (formatted as strings) from a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters and counts how many integers between those two values (exclusive) are symmetric, based on their character representation. If the two integers are equal, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the count of symmetric integers. However, the function does not return any specific output; it only prints the count. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers, which could lead to runtime errors.
