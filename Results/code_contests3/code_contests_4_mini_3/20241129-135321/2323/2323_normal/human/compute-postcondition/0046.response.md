The function `func` accepts two parameters: `stepan_integer` and `m`. The parameter `stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and it has no leading zeros. The parameter `m` is an integer such that 2 is less than or equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to 10^8. The function does not return any output explicitly described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `stepan_integer` representing a large positive integer and an integer `m`, without specifying a return value in the output details.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string stepan_integer representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros, and an integer m such that 2 <= m <= 10^8.**
