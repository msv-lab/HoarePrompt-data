According to the code, the loop's execution is dependent on the variable `i` and the limit `c`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the bounds of the loop. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1. If `i` is currently at a value less than `c`, then for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented.

Assuming `i` was less than `c` at the end of the last iteration, we will update `i` to reflect the next iteration. 

State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `c`.**
