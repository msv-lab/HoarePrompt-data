The value of `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is greater than 0. The operation `copya //= 10` performs an integer division of `copya` by 10. Since `copya` was just assigned the value of `a`, after this operation, `copya` will be reduced to `a // 10`. The values of `stepan_integer`, `m`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is now `a // 10`.

Output State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is now `a // 10`**.
