Postcondition: ***`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; if `a` is not divisible by 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `10 % b`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, and `a` is recalculated as `10`.***
