Postcondition: ***`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `a` is not divisible by 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `10 % b`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to 10.***
