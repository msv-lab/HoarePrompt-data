Functionality: ** The function accepts two input integers, `a` and `b`, where `a` is expected to be a positive integer with at least 2 digits, and `b` is an integer such that 2 <= b <= 10^8. It computes the minimum value of `a % b` after transforming `a` by moving its last non-zero digit to the front, and prints this minimum value. The function does not handle cases where `a` has no non-zero digits. **
