Postcondition: ***`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. If `a` is not a multiple of 10, then `a` is 10 and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `a % b`, where `b` is unknown. Otherwise, `a` is updated to 10.***
