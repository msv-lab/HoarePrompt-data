`c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 20; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is either 0 or 1.
