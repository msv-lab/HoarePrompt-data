The value of `copya` is assigned `copya //= 10`, which means `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. The previous value of `copya` is `a // 10`, and since `a` is at least 20, `copya` must be at least 2. After performing the integer division by 10, the value of `copya` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the specific value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 20; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is either 0 or 1.
