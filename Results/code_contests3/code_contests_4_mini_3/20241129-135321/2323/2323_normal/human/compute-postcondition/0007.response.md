According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is now `a // 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than zero. This means that `a` must be at least 20 because when `a` is 20, `copya` becomes 2, which is still greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, we need to ensure that `a` is at least 20.

State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 20; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is now `a // 10`**
