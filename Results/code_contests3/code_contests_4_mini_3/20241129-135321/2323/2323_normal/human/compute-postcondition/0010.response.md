According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will only execute if `copya` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be set to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 20; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; and for the loop to execute again `copya` is 1**
