According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as the variable `copya` is truthy, which in Python means it needs to be a non-zero value. Since `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be non-zero.

Given that `a` is an input integer, we must ensure that it is greater than 0. Since the state specifies that `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, we need to adjust `a` accordingly.

State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.**
