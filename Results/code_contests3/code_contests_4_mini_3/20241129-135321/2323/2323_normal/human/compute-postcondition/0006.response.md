`c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than 0; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is now `a // 10`**
