The variable `a` is updated to be `10 ** c * h + a`. The value of `h` is the last digit of `a`, and since `a` is now an integer less than or equal to `(a - 10)`, this implies that `a` is decreasing. The exact values of `c` and `h` are not provided, but we know that `c` dictates the power of 10 being multiplied by `h`, thus significantly affecting the value of `a`.

However, without specific values for `c` and `h`, we cannot determine the exact new value for `a`. The overall impact is that `a` is increased by a multiple of `h` based on the power of 10 defined by `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, where `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` continues to be less than or equal to (a - 10).
