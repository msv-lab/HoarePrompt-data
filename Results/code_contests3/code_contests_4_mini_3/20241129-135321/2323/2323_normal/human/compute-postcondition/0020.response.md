The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a % b`. Given that `a` is updated to `10`, we need to consider the previous value of `ans` and the value of `b` to calculate `a % b`. However, since the values of `ans` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the operation performed without specific values for `ans` and `b`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `10 % b`**
