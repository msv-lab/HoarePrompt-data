The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 2. Therefore, after execution, `c` will be 3. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`stepan_integer` is a string representing a positive integer of length between 2 and 200,000 digits without leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 20; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `copya` is 0**
