According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is not zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is a positive integer input. Since `a` is positive, `copya` is also positive, and thus the loop can execute one time. No adjustments are necessary for `copya` to ensure that the loop executes at least once.

State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
