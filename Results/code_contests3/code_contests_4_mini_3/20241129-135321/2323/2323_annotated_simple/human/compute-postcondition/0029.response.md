The variable `a` is assigned a new value based on the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. The value of `10 ** c` depends on `c`, which is greater than 0, making `10 ** c` at least 10. The other variables, `copya`, `i`, and `h`, are not directly mentioned in the expression but could affect the output if their values were known. Therefore, we can conclude that `a` is updated with a new value that includes the product of `10 ** c` and `h`, added to its previous value.

Since we do not have the specific value of `h`, we cannot give an exact numeric result for `a`. However, we acknowledge that `a` has been updated.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `a` is updated by `10 ** c * h + a`.**
