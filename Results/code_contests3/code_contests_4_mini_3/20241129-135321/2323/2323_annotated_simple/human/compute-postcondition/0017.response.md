`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by 10. Since `a` is a positive integer and not a multiple of 10, `h` will be a positive integer between 1 and 9. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, and `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 9.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, and `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 9**
