The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the result of the expression `a % b`. The value of `a` is 10, but the value of `b` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot compute `a % b` without knowing `b`. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `ans` is updated to `min(ans, a % b)` with `a` as 10 and `b` unknown.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `ans` is updated to `min(ans, a % b)` with `a` as 10 and `b` unknown**.
