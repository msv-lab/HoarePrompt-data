Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `a` (with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits) and an integer `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates the minimum remainder of `a` when divided by `b` after potentially rearranging the digits of `a` by moving non-zero digits to the front. The function outputs this minimum remainder. If `a` is modified by moving its digits, the function ensures that zeros are not moved to the front, which could change the value. **
