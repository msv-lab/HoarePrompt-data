In the given code, `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. Since `h` is initialized to 0, the term `10 ** c * h` will evaluate to 0 regardless of the value of `c` (as long as it is greater than 0). Thus, the new value of `a` will be the same as its previous value, which is a positive integer divided by 10.

The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer divided by 10 (unchanged), `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer divided by 10 (unchanged), `h` is 0**
