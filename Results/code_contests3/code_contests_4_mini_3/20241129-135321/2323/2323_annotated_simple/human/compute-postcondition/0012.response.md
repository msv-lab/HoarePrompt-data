The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `copya` is reduced by a factor of 10 and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, the loop conditions are still valid depending on the initial value of `copya`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is reduced by a factor of 10 and for the loop to execute again `copya` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is reduced by a factor of 10 and for the loop to execute again `copya` must be greater than 0.**
