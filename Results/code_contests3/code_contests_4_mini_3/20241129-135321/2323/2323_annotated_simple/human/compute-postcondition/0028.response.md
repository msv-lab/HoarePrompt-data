The variable `a` is divided by 10 using floor division (`//=`), which effectively removes the last digit of `a`. The previous values of the affected variables are `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. However, the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a` after the operation. Therefore, we can only note that `a` is updated but cannot specify its new value.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `a` is updated by floor division by 10**
