`a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`, which means `a` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `a` is a positive integer that is divisible by 10, the result will be a positive integer. Other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`, `h`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer divided by 10, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer divided by 10, `h` is 0**
