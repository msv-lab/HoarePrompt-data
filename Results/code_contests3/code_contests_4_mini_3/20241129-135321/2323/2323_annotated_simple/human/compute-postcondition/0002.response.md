The code initializes `c` to 0. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0**
