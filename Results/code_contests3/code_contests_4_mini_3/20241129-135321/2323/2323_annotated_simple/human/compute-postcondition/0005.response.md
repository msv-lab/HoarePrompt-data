The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using floor division. The previous value of `copya` is the same as `a`, which is a positive integer input. After this operation, `copya` will be equal to `a // 10`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is `a // 10**
