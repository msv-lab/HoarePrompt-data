The value of `copya` is assigned the result of `copya //= 10`, which means `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. The previous value of `copya` is `a // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer input, `copya` will be a non-negative integer. If `copya` was greater than or equal to 10, it will now be reduced to a smaller integer value. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is reduced by a factor of 10**
