Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. If `a` is not a multiple of 10, then `a` is greater than its previous value, `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 9, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and an undetermined value resulting from `a % b`. Otherwise, `a` remains a positive integer divided by 10, and `h` is 0.***
