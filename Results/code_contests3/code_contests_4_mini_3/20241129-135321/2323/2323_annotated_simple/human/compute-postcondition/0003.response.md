`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is a positive integer input. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
