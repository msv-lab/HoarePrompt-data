`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a` is a positive integer that is divisible by 10, the result of `a % 10` will be 0. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer that is divisible by 10, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer that is divisible by 10, and `h` is 0.**
