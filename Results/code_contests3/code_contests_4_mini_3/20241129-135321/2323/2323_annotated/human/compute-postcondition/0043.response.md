Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, `a` is updated to 10, and the value of `ans` depends on the undefined variable `b`. Otherwise, `h` is the last digit of the original `a` and the new value of `a` is 10.***
