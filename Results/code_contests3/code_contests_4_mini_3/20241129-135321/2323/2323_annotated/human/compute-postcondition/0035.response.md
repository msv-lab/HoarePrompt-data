According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `c` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `c` is still greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 2.**
