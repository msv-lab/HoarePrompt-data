The variable `a` is updated by the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. Given that `h` is 0, the calculation simplifies to `10 ** c * 0 + a`, which results in `a` remaining unchanged since `10 ** c * 0` is 0. Thus, `a` retains its previous value. The other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`, `ans`, and `h`) remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `h` is 0, and `a` is unchanged.
Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `h` is 0, and `a` is unchanged.**
