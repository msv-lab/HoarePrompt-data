According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `c`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `c` is greater than 0, the loop can execute for the first time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1.

Since `c` is greater than 0, it will still allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows: `i` is incremented to 1, and `c` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 1**
