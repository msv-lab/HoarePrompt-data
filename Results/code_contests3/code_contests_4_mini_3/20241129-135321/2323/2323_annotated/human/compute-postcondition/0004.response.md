According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is non-zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is equal to `a`, which is a positive integer, implying that `copya` is also non-zero. Thus, the loop can execute at least once without any modifications needed.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is equal to `a`**
