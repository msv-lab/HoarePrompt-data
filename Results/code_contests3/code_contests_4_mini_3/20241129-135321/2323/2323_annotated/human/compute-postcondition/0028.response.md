The variable `a` is modified by performing an integer division by 10, which will effectively remove the last digit of `a`. The value of `h` remains unchanged as it is assigned before this operation and does not depend on `a` after the assignment. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, and `a` is now `a // 10`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, and `a` is now `a // 10.**
