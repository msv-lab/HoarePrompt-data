The value of `a` is unknown, but when executing `a //= 10`, it performs an integer division of `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. This operation alters the value of `a`, but does not affect `copya`, `c`, or `i`. As a result, we can only describe the change in `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a` is now `a // 10` (with its new value being unknown).

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a` is now `a // 10`**
