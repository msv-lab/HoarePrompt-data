`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is a positive integer. The value of `a` is unchanged, and the other variables `b` and `c` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is equal to `a`**
