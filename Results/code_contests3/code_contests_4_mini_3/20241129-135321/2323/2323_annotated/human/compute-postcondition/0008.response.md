The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `a` is a positive integer and must be at least 10 for the loop to execute again, the value of `copya` will change accordingly. However, we don't have the specific initial value of `copya`, so we can only describe the outcome generally. The state of `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division**
