According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is non-zero (i.e., truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `copya` will be non-zero as long as `a` is greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `a` must be at least 10.

To ensure `copya` is still greater than 0 in the next iteration, `a` must be adjusted accordingly. Specifically, `a` should be modified to be at least 10.

State: **`a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 10**
