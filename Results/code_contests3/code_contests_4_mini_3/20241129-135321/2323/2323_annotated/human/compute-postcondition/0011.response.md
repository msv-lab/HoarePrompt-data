The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using floor division, which reduces its value. Since `copya` is greater than 0, it will still remain a non-negative integer after this operation. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation, and `c` was previously increased by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `copya` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `copya` is now less than or equal to `copya // 10`, `c` is increased by 1**
