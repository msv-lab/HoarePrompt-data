The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown, so the output state indicates that `c` has been increased. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division, and `c` is increased by 1**
