The operation `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The state of the other variables is not directly affected by this operation. Since `h` is defined as `a % 10`, it will no longer hold the same value after `a` is modified. 

The output state reflects the new value of `a` after the integer division, but without knowing the specific value of `a`, we can only note that it has been modified.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `a` is now `a // 10`, `h` is now `a % 10`**
