`a` is modified by the operation `a //= 10`, which performs integer division of `a` by 10. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `a`, but it does affect `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h`. The value of `h` remains unchanged as `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10` before this operation. The variable `copya` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `h` is assigned to the value of `a % 10`, and `a` is now `a // 10`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `h` is assigned to the value of `a % 10`, and `a` is now `a // 10.**
