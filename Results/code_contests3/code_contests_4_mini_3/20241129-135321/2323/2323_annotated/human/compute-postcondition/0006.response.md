The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `copya` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
