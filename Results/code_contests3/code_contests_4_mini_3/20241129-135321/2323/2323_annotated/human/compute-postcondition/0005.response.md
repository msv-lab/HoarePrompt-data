`copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`, where `copya` is initially equal to `a`. Since `a` is a positive integer, performing integer division by 10 will result in a value that is the integer part of `a` divided by 10. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
