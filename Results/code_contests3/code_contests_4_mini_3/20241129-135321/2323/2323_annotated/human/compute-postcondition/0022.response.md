`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a % 10` is given to be equal to 0, `h` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, and `h` is 0**.
