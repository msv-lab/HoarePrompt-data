The variable `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The current value of `a` is known as `a // 10` (after a previous operation), and `h` is now `a % 10`. The value of `c` is greater than 0, thus `10 ** c` is a positive integer. The overall impact on `a` is that it will be updated based on its previous value and the calculated value of `10 ** c * h`. The other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, `h` is now `a % 10`**
