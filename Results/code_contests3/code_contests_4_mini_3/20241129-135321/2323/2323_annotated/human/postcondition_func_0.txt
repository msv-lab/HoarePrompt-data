The function accepts two integers as input, where the first integer is expected to be a positive number with potentially up to 200,000 digits, and the second is a positive integer between 2 and 10^8. It calculates the minimum value of the first integer modulo the second integer after performing a series of digit manipulations. Specifically, it rotates the digits of the first integer and checks the modulo for each rotation to find the minimum value. Finally, it prints this minimum value. The function does not return a value; it simply outputs the result.
