Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the stripped input from stdin; `S` is the value of `s` after applying the `gets` function; `C` is calculated as ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'); `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is decremented by `M`; `M` is XORed with 3, resulting in `M` being either 2 or 1.**
