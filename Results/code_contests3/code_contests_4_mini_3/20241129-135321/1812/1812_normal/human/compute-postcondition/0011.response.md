The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the row number, with a constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The parameter `s` is a character that can be one of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', representing the seat in that row. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the values of `n` and `s`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number, and a character s ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing the seat in that row.**
