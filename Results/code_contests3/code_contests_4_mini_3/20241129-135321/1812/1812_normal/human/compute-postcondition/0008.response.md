The value of `N` is incremented by `M`. Since `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` will be increased by either 1 or 2. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the stripped input from stdin; `S` is the value of `s` after applying the `gets` function; `C` is calculated as ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'); `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either N (before increment) + 1 or N (before increment) + 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the stripped input from stdin; `S` is the value of `s` after applying the `gets` function; `C` is calculated as ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'); `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is either N + 1 or N + 2.**
