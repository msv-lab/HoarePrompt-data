Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number, and a character `s` ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing the seat in that row. It processes the input to calculate a specific value based on the row number and seat position, which is then printed. The function does not handle invalid input cases (such as invalid characters for `s` or non-positive integers for `n`).**
