Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements from the problem description. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Row Calculation Logic**: The logic used to adjust the row number `N` based on the value of `M` (which is derived from `N - 1 & 3`) is not aligned with the serving pattern described. The attendants serve rows in a specific sequence of 1, 2, 3, and then jump to 5, 6, 7, etc. The bitwise operations and the conditional adjustments do not accurately reflect this pattern.

2. **Serving Time Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the time taken to serve passengers `print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))` does not correspond to the serving order and time described in the problem. The problem specifies distinct times for serving passengers in a specific order (right to left), while the function's arithmetic doesnâ€™t adequately account for the serving time across the two attendants nor does it differentiate correctly based on the row served.

3. **Seat Order**: The program does not properly account for the serving order from the window to the aisle for each seat type in accordance to the rules stated. The seat order should be considered as 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a' which is not reflected properly in the current structure.

4. **General Logic and Edge Cases**: There is a lack of clarity on how the program handles different row configurations based on the input format and how it calculates the time for various rows beyond the first few, particularly for higher row numbers. Given the row serving pattern, the calculations would need to ensure that they account for the serving time based on the unique patterns described.

In summary, the current logic does not accurately simulate the described serving process for the flight attendants in the airplane, leading to incorrect calculations of the waiting time for Vasya. Hence, the program is not correct based on the problem description.
