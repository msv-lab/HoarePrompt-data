The value of `N` is incremented by `M`. Since `M` can be either 1 or 2, the possible new values for `N` after the operation are:

1. If `M` is 1, then `N` becomes either `(N - 1) + 1` or `(N - 2) + 1`, resulting in `N` being either `N` (originally `N - 1`) or `N - 1` (originally `N - 2`).
2. If `M` is 2, then `N` becomes either `(N - 1) + 2` or `(N - 2) + 2`, resulting in `N` being either `N + 1` (originally `N - 1`) or `N` (originally `N - 2`).

Therefore, the possible states for `N` after the operation are either `N` or `N + 1`. The value of `M` will also switch between 1 and 2.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is either (N - 1) or (N - 2); `M` is either 1 or 2; after operation, `N` is either `N` or `N + 1`, and `M` is either 2 or 1 respectively.

Output State: **`N` is either (N - 1) or (N - 2); `M` is either 1 or 2; after operation, `N` is either `N` or `N + 1`, and `M` is either 2 or 1 respectively.**
