The operation `M ^= 3` is a bitwise XOR operation that modifies the value of `M` based on its current value. 

If `M` is either 1 or 2:
- If `M` is 1: 
  - `1 ^ 3` in binary is `01 ^ 11`, which results in `10` (or 2 in decimal).
- If `M` is 2:
  - `2 ^ 3` in binary is `10 ^ 11`, which results in `01` (or 1 in decimal).

Thus, `M` will toggle between 1 and 2 depending on its initial value. The value of `N` remains unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is either (N - 1) or (N - 2); `M` is either 1 or 2, and after the operation, `M` is either 2 or 1 respectively.

Output State: **`N` is either (N - 1) or (N - 2); `M` is either 1 or 2, and after the operation, `M` is either 2 or 1 respectively.**
