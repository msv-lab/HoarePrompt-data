Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and a character `s` representing a seat ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'). It calculates a value based on `n` and `s`, specifically using bitwise operations and arithmetic to derive a final result, which is printed. The function does not return any value; it solely outputs the computed value. The logic may lead to unexpected results for certain values of `s`, particularly if `s` is not one of the expected characters.**
