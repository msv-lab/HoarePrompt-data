The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the row number, constrained by the condition \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). The parameter `s` is a character that represents the seat in that row, and it can be one of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'. The function does not return any output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` representing a row number and a character `s` representing a seat in that row. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and a character s ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing the seat in that row.**
