The function accepts a positive integer `n` (representing the row number, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and a character `s` (representing the seat in that row, which must be one of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'). It computes a value based on the row number and seat character, specifically adjusting the row number based on certain conditions related to `M`, and then prints a calculated expression involving `N` and the seat character. The function does not return any value, only prints the result.
