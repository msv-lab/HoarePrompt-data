The function accepts a positive integer `t` followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of 9 rows of 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9'. It processes each row by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' and collects the modified rows into a result list. Finally, it outputs the modified rows for each test case. The function does not verify the validity of the Sudoku solutions; it only modifies the input data.
