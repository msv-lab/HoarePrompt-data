According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, which is the last valid index for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9, but since `range(9)` only allows values from 0 to 8, there will not be a valid index for the loop to execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be 9, but `i` cannot be less than 9 to allow for another iteration because the loop has already completed its 9 iterations.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `row` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be 9 which is out of the range.**
