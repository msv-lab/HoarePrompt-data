According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next value from `row`. Since `row` was not defined in the provided state, we can only assume that it contains at least one more element.

If `i` takes a value other than '9', `nRow` will be increased by that value. Therefore, if `row` has at least one more element, we can denote that `i` will be the next value in `row`, and `nRow` will either be updated by appending '1' or increased by the new value of `i`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must contain at least one more element, and `i` will take the next value in `row`.**
