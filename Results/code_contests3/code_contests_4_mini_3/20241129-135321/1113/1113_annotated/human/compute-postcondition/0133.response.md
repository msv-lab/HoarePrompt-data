`nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i` to it. The current value of `i` is 0, so `nRow` will be updated to contain the original value of `nRow` followed by '0'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '0', `row` is the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 0 and `i` is not equal to '9'.
