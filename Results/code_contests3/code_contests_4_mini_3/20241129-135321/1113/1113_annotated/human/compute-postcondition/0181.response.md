To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop behavior based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The initial state mentions that `row` is a non-empty user-provided string, which means it has at least one character. The loop iterates over each character in `row`.

During each iteration:
- If the character `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If the character `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

After the loop has executed for all characters in the `row` string:
- `nRow` will contain the transformed string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', while all other characters remain unchanged.
- The value of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `t` will remain unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the output state is:

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is the original user-provided string, `nRow` is the transformed string with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
