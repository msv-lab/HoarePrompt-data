`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is retained, and since `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` now contains its original value plus this character. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `row` are not affected. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to contain its original value plus `i`.**
