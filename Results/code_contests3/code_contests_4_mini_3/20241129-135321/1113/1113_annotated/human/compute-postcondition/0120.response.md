The value of `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`. Since `i` takes the next value in `row`, and `row` must contain at least one more element for the loop to execute one more time, we don't know the exact value of `i`, but we know it is valid for the operation. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `row` has at least one more element, `i` is the next value in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.
