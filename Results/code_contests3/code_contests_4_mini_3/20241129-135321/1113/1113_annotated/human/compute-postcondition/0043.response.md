Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated to contain the new value of `nRow` if `i` is '9', where `nRow` is updated based on the character processed and now includes '1'. If `i` is not '9', `res` remains as `nRow`, and `nRow` is updated based on the character processed. In both cases, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`.***
