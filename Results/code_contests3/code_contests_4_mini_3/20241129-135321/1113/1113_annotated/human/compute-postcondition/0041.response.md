The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. Since `res` contains `nRow`, the state of `res` will also change to reflect this new value. The other variables `maxint`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will include the updated values for `res` and `nRow`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated to contain the new value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the character processed and now includes '1'.**
