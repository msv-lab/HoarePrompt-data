`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the third character in `row`. Since `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again, `i` is defined and has a specific value (the character at index 2 of `row`). The previous state of `nRow` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated with `i`.
