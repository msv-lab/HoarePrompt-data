The `nRow` variable is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'**.
