The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and the newly assigned value of `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is assigned the input string stripped of whitespace.**
