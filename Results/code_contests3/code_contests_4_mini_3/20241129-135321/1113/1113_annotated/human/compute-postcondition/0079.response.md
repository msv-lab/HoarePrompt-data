Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, and `t` is 1. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the second character from `row` followed by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` now contains the second character from `row` followed by itself (the second character in `row`).***
