`nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. The initial state indicates that `res` contains the original value of `nRow`, but the new value of `nRow` will be that original value plus '1'. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on that character, now containing the original value plus '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to the original value plus '1'.**
