The statement `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `row` is an input string provided by the user, `i` is the first character of `row`, and the first character `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `row` is an input string provided by the user, `i` is the first character of `row`, and the first character `i` is equal to '9'**.
