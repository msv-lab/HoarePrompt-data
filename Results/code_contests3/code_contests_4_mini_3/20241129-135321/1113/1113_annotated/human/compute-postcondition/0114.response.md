According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`, which is a string containing characters. The loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current character being processed.

At the end of the last iteration, given that `i` is '9', `nRow` has been set to '1'. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `row` must be considered. If `row` contains more characters after the current character, the loop can execute again.

Since `maxint` remains positive infinity and `res` has 11 strings, these states do not need to be adjusted. The only adjustment needed is for `i`, which will take the next character in `row`.

If `row` contains more characters, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string, and `nRow` will be set according to the new value of `i` (if it's '9', then `nRow` will be '1', otherwise it will take the value of `i`).

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, if `i` is the next character in `row`, then `nRow` is set to the value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'.**
