The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is set to the value of `i` only if `i` is not equal to '9', we don't have information about the current value of `nRow` before this operation, but it will be concatenated with '1'. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
