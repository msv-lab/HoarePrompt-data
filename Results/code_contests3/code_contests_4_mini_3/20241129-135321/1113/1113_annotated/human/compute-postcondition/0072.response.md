The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
