Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `i` is the next character in `row` which remains a non-empty string for the loop to execute again. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
