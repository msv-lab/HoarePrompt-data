`nRow` is assigned the value of its previous value concatenated with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '0', so after execution, `nRow` will be the original value concatenated with '01'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '01', `row` remains the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 1.
