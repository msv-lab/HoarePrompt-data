Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated; if `i` is '9', `nRow` is now the original `nRow` plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to contain its original value plus `i`.***
