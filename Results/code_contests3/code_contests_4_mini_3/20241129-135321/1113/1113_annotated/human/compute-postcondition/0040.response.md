According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next character in `row`. Given that `row` has at least 2 characters, after processing the second character, we need to assess the state for the third character.

Since `row` has at least 2 characters, we know that there is a third character to process. Therefore, the loop will execute again with `i` being the third character of `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the character processed.**
