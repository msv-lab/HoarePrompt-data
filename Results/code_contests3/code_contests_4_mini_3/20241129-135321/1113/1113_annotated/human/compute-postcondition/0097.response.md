`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the character at index 10 of `row`. The value of `row` must have at least 11 characters for the loop to execute one more time, so `i` will be a valid character. However, the specific value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` has at least 11 characters, and `nRow` is updated by adding character `i` at index 10 of `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` has at least 11 characters, and `nRow` is updated by adding character `i` at index 10 of `row.**
