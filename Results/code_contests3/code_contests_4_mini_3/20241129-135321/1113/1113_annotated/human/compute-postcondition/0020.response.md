Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i`, and `row` must remain a non-empty string for the loop to execute again.***
