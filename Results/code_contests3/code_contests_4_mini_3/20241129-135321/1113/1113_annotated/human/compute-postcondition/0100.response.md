The value of `nRow` is appended with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value, but it is modified by adding '1' to it. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again, and `i` is the third character in `row`.
