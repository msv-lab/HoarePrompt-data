The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include this character. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the character processed.
