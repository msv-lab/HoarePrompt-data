The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it processes input that consists of an integer `t` followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters, which are digits from '1' to '9', representing a valid Sudoku solution in a 9x9 grid format. After executing the function body, it verifies the validity of each Sudoku grid. The function does not return a value directly but is implied to confirm that the provided Sudoku grids are valid solutions based on the input structure. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer t followed by t test cases of 9x9 Sudoku grids and verifies the validity of each Sudoku solution.**
