The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Given that `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9' (though its exact value is not specified), the result of the operation depends on the value of `i`. Since concatenating a string with an empty string results in the string itself, `nRow` will now hold the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a user-provided string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a user-provided string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
