In the given code snippet, `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables (like `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string.**
