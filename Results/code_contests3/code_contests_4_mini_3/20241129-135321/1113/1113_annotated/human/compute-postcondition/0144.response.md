The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 18 strings, and `nRow` has been defined as the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', while keeping all other characters unchanged. This means that the length of `res` will now increase by 1, and it will contain one additional string, which is the value of `nRow`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings now (the original 18 plus the new `nRow`), `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is the last input string provided by the user, and `nRow` is the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings now, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is the last input string provided by the user, `nRow` is the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'**.
