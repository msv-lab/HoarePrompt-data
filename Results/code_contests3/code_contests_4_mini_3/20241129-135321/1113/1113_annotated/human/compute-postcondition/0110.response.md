The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value, which is an empty string `''`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes `'1'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'.**
