`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `i` is '9'**
