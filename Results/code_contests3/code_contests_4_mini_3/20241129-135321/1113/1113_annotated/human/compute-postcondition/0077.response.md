The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is the second character from `row`, which is a non-empty string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `nRow` is the second character from `row` followed by '1', and `i` is the second character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `nRow` is the second character from `row` followed by '1', `i` is the second character in `row`**
