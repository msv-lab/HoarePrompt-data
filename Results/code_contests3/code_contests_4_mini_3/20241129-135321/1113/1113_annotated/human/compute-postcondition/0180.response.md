Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, and `row` is a non-empty user-provided string with at least 11 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the next character in `row` concatenated with '1' followed by another '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the next character in `row` concatenated with '1' plus `i`.***
