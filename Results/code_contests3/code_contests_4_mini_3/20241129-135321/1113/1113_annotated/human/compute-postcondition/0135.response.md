According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`, which contains 18 strings. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and not equal to '9', meaning the loop has executed for the first character in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, allowing it to process the second character in `row`. Since `row` contains 18 strings, it has enough characters for the loop to run again. 

Thus, after the next iteration, the state will be:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '0', `row` remains the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 1**
