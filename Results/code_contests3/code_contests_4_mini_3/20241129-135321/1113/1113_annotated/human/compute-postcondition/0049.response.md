According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable, which is an input string. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character after stripping whitespace. Since `i` is set to 9 before the loop starts, it is implied that `i` would be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty input string after stripping whitespace**
