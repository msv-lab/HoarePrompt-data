According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `row` string. The loop will continue to execute for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is '9', thus `nRow` is '1' and `i` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character following '9'. Since `i` is '9', the next character in the iteration will be the next character of `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a non-empty user-provided string, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more character after '9', `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be equal to that character.**
