The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its original value. Since `nRow` is initially a certain value (the original value before the addition of '1'), the new value of `nRow` will now be that original value followed by '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to the original value plus '1'.
