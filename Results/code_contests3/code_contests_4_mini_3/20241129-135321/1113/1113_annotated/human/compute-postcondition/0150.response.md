`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a user-provided string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a user-provided string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
