`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` initially is an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is '1', `row` is the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is '1', `row` is the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 9**
