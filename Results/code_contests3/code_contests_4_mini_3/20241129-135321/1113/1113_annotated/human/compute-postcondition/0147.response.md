The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is being reset to an empty string. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is the user-provided string, `nRow` is now an empty string, and `i` must be 9 for the loop to execute a tenth time.
