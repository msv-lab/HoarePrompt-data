The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was an input string with all instances of '9' replaced by '1'. Since the value is now changed to an empty string, the previous value is overwritten. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `nRow` is '', `row` is the input string provided by the user.**
