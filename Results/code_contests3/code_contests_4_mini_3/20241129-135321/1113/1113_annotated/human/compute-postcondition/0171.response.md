`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The initial value of `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` will be the first character in `row`. Thus, after execution, `nRow` will be equal to `i`, which is the first character of `row`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a non-empty user-provided string, `nRow` is equal to `i` (the first character of `row`), `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a non-empty user-provided string, `nRow` is equal to `i` (the first character of `row`), `i` is not equal to '9'**.
