The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we can only state that it will now include '1' at the end of whatever its previous value was. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` will now have '1' concatenated to its previous value.
