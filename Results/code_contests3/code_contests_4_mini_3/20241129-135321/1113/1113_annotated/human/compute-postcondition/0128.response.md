The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables, indicating that `nRow` has now been updated to an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `nRow` is '', `row` is the last input string provided by the user, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**.
