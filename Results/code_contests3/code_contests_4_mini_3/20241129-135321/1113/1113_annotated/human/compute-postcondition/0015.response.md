The operation `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, and since `i` is 0, the result of the operation will be that `nRow` remains an empty string with `i` being concatenated to it as a string. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is still an empty string, and `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string**
