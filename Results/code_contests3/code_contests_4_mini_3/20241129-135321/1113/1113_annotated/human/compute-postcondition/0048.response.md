The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This means that the previous value of `nRow`, which contained the original `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', is now overwritten and lost. The other variables such as `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is ''**
