According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will execute again for the next character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is updated to its original value plus '1'. 

Now, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in the `row` string. Since `row` is a non-empty string and we have already processed one character ('9'), the next character will be the character at index 1 (if counting from 0). 

Thus, for the loop to execute again:
- `nRow` will remain as the original value plus '1' since `i` is '9'.
- The next character `i` will be the character at index 1 of `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `nRow` is updated to its original value plus '1', and `i` is the second character in `row`.**
