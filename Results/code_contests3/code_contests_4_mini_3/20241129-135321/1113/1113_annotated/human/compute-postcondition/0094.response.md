Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, if the first character `i` of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to `i`, where `row` is an input string provided by the user and `i` is the first character of `row`.***
