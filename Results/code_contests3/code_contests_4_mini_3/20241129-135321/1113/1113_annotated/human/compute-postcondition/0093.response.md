`nRow` is updated by concatenating the first character of `row` (`i`) to it. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row` (which is guaranteed to be at least 1 character and not '9'), the value of `nRow` becomes equal to the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `nRow` is equal to `i`, `row` is an input string provided by the user, and `i` is the first character of `row`.
