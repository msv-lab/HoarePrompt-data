The variable `res` is assigned an empty list. The initial state of `maxint` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`), `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`), `res` is an empty list**
