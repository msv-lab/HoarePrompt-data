Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a user-provided string with at least 12 characters, and `i` is the character at index 11. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is incremented by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
