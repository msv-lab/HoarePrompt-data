`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. However, this operation indicates that `nRow` will now hold the value of its previous state plus `'1'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
