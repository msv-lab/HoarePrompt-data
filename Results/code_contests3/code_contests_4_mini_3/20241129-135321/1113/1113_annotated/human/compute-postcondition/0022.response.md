The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the previous value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its specific value after execution. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` must remain a non-empty string for the loop to execute again, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1'.
