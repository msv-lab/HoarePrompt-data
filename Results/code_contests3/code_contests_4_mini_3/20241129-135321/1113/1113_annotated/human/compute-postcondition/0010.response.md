The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the state of `nRow` is now an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**.
