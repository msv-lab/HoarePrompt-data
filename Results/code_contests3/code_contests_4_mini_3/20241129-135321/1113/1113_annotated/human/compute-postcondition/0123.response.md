The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` indicates it contains 11 strings, and the variable `nRow` holds the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in the input string `row` with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain 12 strings, with the new string `nRow` added to it. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 12 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', and `row` is the input string provided by the user.**
