The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating the character `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character in `row`, after execution, `nRow` will contain that first character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` now contains the first character from `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` now contains the first character from `row`.**
