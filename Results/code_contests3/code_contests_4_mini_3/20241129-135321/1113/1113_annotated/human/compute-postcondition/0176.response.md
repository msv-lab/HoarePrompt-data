Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, and `row` is a non-empty user-provided string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to be the next character in `row` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to the next character in `row`, and it is updated to contain the value of `nRow` plus `i`.***
