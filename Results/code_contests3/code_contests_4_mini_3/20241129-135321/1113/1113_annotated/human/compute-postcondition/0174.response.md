The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is equal to the next character in `row`, it will now contain that character followed by `'1'`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a non-empty user-provided string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is now equal to the next character in `row` concatenated with '1'.**
