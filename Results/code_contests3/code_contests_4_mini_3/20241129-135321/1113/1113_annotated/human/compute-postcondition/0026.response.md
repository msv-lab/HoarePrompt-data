`res` is modified by appending `nRow` to it. Since `res` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `res` will contain one element, which is the value of `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and `row` remains unchanged.
