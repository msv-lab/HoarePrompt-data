Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `row` is the last input string provided by the user. Otherwise, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '0', `row` remains the last input string provided by the user, and `i` is 0 and not equal to '9'.***
