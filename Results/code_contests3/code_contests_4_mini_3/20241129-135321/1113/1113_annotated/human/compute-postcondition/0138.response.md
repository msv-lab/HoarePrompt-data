Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` remains the last input string provided by the user, and `i` is 1. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '01'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the original value concatenated with '1'.***
