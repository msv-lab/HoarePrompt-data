The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This means that `nRow` is now an empty string, while the other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string, and `row` is assigned the input string stripped of whitespace.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is assigned the input string stripped of whitespace.**
