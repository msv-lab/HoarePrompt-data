The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` will now contain the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the first character of `row`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
