The variable `nRow` is appended with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified but it can be assumed to hold some string value. The operation increases the string length of `nRow` by 1 by adding '1' at the end. Other variables remain unchanged, and since there is no return, we just note the updated state of `nRow`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `row` must contain at least one more element, `i` will take the next value in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.**
