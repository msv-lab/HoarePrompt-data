According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is the last character processed in the string.

If `row` contains more characters, the loop can execute again. Given that `i` is currently equal to '9', `nRow` has been increased by the string '1', which means the next character in `row` will be processed in the next iteration. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` would have been increased by `i`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `row` still has characters left to iterate over. Since `row` is a non-empty string, we can infer that there must be at least one more character after the current `i`.

Thus, the next state needs to reflect that `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the next character.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, for the loop to execute again `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated based on that character.**
