Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty input string after stripping whitespace; if `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is increased by the string '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is increased by `i`.***
