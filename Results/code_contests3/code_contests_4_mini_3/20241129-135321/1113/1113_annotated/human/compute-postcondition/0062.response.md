Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the original `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to the original value plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the original value plus the second character in `row`.***
