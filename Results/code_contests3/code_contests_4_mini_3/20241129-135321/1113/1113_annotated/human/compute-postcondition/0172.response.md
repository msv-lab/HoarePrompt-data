Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 10, `t` is 10, `row` is a non-empty user-provided string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `i` is 9. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to `i` (the first character of `row`) and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
