#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t test cases, each consisting of 9 lines of 9 characters (digits from '1' to '9') representing a correct Sudoku solution. Each test case represents a valid 9x9 Sudoku grid.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `9 * T` strings formed by replacing every '9' in each of the `9 * T` input `row` strings with '1', `T` is a positive integer.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of 9 rows of 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9'. It processes each row by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' and collects the modified rows into a result list. Finally, it outputs the modified rows for each test case. The function does not verify the validity of the Sudoku solutions; it only modifies the input data.
