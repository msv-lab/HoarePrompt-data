To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down what the program is doing and how it relates to the requirements for transforming a valid Sudoku solution into an anti-Sudoku.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Each number in the anti-Sudoku must be in the range [1; 9].
2. Each row must contain at least two equal elements.
3. Each column must contain at least two equal elements.
4. Each 3 × 3 block must contain at least two equal elements.
5. The program must change at most 9 elements to achieve this.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases (Sudoku grids) and processes each row. It attempts to change digits in the following way:
- For every digit in the row, if the digit is '9', it changes it to '1'. Otherwise, it leaves it unchanged.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Row Modification**: The program only modifies '9' to '1'. While this may create duplicates in rows where there are '9's, it does not guarantee that every row will have at least two equal elements. If a row does not contain '9', it will remain unchanged, potentially violating the requirement for duplicates.

2. **Column and Block Considerations**: The program does not explicitly check or manipulate columns or 3 × 3 blocks. Changing only '9's to '1's may not result in valid anti-Sudoku configurations across columns or blocks.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following valid Sudoku input:
```
123456789
987654321
456789123
789123456
234567891
567891234
891234567
345678912
678912345
```
In this case, there are no '9's in the first row. The program would output the same row, and the entire grid would remain valid but not meet the anti-Sudoku requirement because there are no duplicates in any row, column, or block.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure the creation of an anti-Sudoku configuration for all potential cases, specifically in scenarios where no '9's are present in a row. Thus, it can fail to create duplicates as required.

Correctness: **False**.
