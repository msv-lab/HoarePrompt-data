According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means it points to the second character in the `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it contains at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to point to the next character in the `row`. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

State: **`nRow` is '01', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must be a string with at least 3 characters.**
