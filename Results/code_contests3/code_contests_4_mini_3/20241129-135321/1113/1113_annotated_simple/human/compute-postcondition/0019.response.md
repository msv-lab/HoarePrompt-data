The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 1. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value or state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is increased by 1.
