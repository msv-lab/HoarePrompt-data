The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be updated to contain the string '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
