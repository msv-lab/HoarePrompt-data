The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` can either be '11' or depend on the value of `i`, the possible new values of `nRow` after this operation would be '111' if `nRow` was '11', or if `nRow` was based on `i`, it would be the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. The states of `res` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '11' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'; `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`; `row` remains a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'; `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`; `row` remains a non-empty iterable.**
