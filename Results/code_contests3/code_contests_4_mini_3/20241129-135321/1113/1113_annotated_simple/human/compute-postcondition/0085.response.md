The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'. Since no other variables are affected, the output state will reflect the current state of `nRow` and indicate that it has been appended to `res`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'; `res` now contains `nRow`.**
