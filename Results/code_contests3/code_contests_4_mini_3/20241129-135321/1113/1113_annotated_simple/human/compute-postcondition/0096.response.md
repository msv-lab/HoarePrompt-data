The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', which means it will concatenate '1' to its previous value. Since `nRow` is either '1' or equal to `i`, after the execution, `nRow` will be '11' if it was '1' or it will be `i` concatenated with '1' if it was equal to `i`. The state of `res` is not affected, and `row` remains a non-empty iterable, allowing the loop to execute again. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '11' or equal to `i` concatenated with '1'; `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`; `row` remains a non-empty iterable; `i` will be the next element in `row`.**
