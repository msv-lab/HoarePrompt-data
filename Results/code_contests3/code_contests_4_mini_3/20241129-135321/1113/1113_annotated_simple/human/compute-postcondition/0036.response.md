According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` string. The loop will continue for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is either 'nRow1' if the first character in `row` is '9', or it is increased by the value of `i`, which is the first character in `row`. 

Since `i` represents each character in `row`, after the last iteration, `i` will have moved to the next character. To execute one more time, we need to consider the length of `row`. If the loop has already processed the last character, it wonâ€™t execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `row` still has more characters left to iterate over.

Assuming `row` has more characters to process, and the first character of `row` was not '9' in the last iteration, `i` would have moved to the next character of `row`. 

State: **`nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`, for the loop to execute again `row` must contain more characters, and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
