`nRow` is modified by appending '1' to its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is modified by appending '1' to its previous value, and `i` is the next value from `row`.
Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is modified by appending '1' to its previous value, and `i` is the next value from `row`.**
