The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is initially '11', adding `i` (which represents the next character in `row`) will result in a new string that concatenates these values. The execution of this line assumes that `i` has a valid character to concatenate. Other variables are not affected by this operation, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`nRow` is '11' concatenated with `i`**
