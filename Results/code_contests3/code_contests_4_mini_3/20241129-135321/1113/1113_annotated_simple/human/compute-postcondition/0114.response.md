According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', so for the loop to execute again, `i` will take the next character in `row`. Since `nRow` is '1' when `i` is '9', it indicates that if `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '1', but this won't affect the next iteration because `i` will now be the next character in `row`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character after '9'. Therefore, `i` will be set to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be set to that character if it is the first character of `row` and is not equal to '9'.

State: **`nRow` is '1' if `i` is '9', for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more character after '9', and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
