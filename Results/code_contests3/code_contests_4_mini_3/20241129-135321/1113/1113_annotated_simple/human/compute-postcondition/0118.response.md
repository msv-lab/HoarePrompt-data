According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current character '9', then the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is '11' and `i` is '9', which indicates that there is at least one more character following '9' in `row`. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be updated to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` should remain '11' since we are still considering the same condition.

State: **`nRow` is '11', `i` will be the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more character after '9'.**
