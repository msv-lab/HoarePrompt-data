To analyze the impact of the code snippet, we start with the initial state. 

- `nRow` can either be '11' or the concatenation of `i` with '1' if `i` is '9'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated based on the addition of `i`. 
- The variable `res` holds the previous value of `nRow`.
- The variable `row` is a non-empty iterable and remains unchanged.

Now, examining the code `nRow += i`, we see that `nRow` is being updated by adding `i` to it. The type of `nRow` appears to be a string based on the context given (especially if it was initially '11' or a concatenation of `i`), and adding an integer (`i`) to a string in Python would typically raise a TypeError.

However, since the task does not specify the types or behavior explicitly, we will assume that `i` is treated as an integer for the purpose of this operation. 

1. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` would be updated from `i + '1'` which would yield a string followed by '1' (results in an invalid operation if `i` is treated as a string).
2. If `nRow` is '11' and `i` is treated as an integer, the operation would convert `nRow` into a number first (11) and then add `i` to it.

Given that the specific value of `i` and the current type of `nRow` are not provided, we can only outline the results based on the possible interpretations.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated based on the addition of `i`, and `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, while `row` remains a non-empty iterable.**
