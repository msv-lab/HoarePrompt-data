Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters remaining. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by 2.***
