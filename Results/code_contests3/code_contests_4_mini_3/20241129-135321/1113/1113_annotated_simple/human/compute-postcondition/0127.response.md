`row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take a new input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `row` is not specified, so it will be updated to the new input string after stripping. Other variables (`res`, `nRow`, `T`, `t`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to the last row processed, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 1.
