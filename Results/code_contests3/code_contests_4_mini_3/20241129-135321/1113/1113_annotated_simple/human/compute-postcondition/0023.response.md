The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 2. However, the previous value of `nRow` is not given, so we only know that it is increased by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters remaining, and `nRow` is increased by 2.
