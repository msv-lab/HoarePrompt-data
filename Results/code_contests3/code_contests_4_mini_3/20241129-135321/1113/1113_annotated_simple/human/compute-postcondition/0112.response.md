The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` now becomes the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `res` contains previous values, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is the first character of `row`, `res` contains previous values, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
