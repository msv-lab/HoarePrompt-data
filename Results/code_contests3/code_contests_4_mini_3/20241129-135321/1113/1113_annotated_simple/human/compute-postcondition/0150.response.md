The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the value of `nRow`. As a result, we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow` after this operation. The other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is increased by appending '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is increased by appending '1'.**
