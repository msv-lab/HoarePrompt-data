The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For every character, if it is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the character itself. After all iterations, `nRow` will consist of all characters from `row`, with every '9' replaced by '1'. The variable `res` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `i` will represent the index of the last character processed in `row`. If `row` is non-empty, `i` will be equal to the length of `row` minus one after the loop completes, and `nRow` will be a string that reflects these modifications.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is equal to the length of `row` minus one, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
