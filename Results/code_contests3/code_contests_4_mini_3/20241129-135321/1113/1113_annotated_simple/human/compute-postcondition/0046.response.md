According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 9 times based on the range defined. The variable `i` is the loop counter that starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. Since the loop has already executed for the previous iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next execution. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8. 

Given that the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 9, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be 9. Since `nRow` is a string where every '9' is replaced by '1', this state does not change for the next iteration.

State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' is replaced by '1', `res` now includes that updated string, `i` is 9, for the loop to not execute again, `i` must be less than 9**
