The code initializes an empty list `res`. Since `res` is a new variable, there are no previous values to consider for it. The other variables `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value of reading from the standard input stream using `io.BytesIO`; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the value of reading from the standard input stream using `io.BytesIO`; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list.**
