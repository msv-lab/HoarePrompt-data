According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 since the range is from 0 to 8 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 9. Since `i` is now equal to 9, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', `res` now contains `nRow`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 9**
