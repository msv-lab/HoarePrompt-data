The code registers a cleanup function to be executed upon normal program termination. This function will write the contents of `sys.stdout`, which is currently redirected to an in-memory buffer, to the standard output stream (file descriptor 1). The values of variables are not directly affected by this operation, but it sets up a behavior for when the program exits.

Output State: **The standard output stream is redirected to an in-memory buffer (io.BytesIO), and a cleanup function is registered to write the buffer's contents to standard output upon program termination.**
