The value of `nRow` is appended with '1'. The state indicates that the previous value of `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end. The variable `i` is '10', but it does not affect the assignment of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is '10', and `nRow` is updated with '1'.

Output State: **`i` is '10'; `nRow` is updated with '1'**
