The value of `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`, and `i` represents the next character in `row`. The conditions specify that the loop continues to execute as long as `row` contains at least one more character.

Since `nRow` could either be 'nRow1' or a previous value increased by `i`, the new value of `nRow` will depend on the specific character represented by `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects possible outcomes based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the character `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row` with at least one more character available in `row`.**
