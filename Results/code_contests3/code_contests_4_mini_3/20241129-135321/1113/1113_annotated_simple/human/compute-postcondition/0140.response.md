The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now include '1' at the end. The states of the other variables (`res`, `row`, `T`, `t`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `i` will be the next character in `row`; `nRow` now ends with '1'.
