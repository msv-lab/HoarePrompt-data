The value of `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to it. Since `nRow` is either '1' or equal to `i`, after this operation, `nRow` will be either '1' + `i` (if `i` is a string) or will be an integer addition (if `i` is an integer) depending on the type of `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated to the new value based on the addition of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` remains a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to the new value based on the addition of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` remains a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute again.**
