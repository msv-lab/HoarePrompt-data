`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `nRow` is the string '01' and `i` is 2. The operation concatenates the integer `i` to the string `nRow`, resulting in the new value of `nRow` being '012'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '012', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`nRow` is '012', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 2**
