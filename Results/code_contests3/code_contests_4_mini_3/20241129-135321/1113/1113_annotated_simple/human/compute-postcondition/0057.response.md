`nRow` is a string with the value '0', and `i` is 1. The operation `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the integer `i` to the string `nRow`. In Python, this operation would convert `i` to a string and concatenate it. Therefore, `nRow` will become '01' after the operation. The states of `res` and `row` are not affected. 

Output State: **`nRow` is '01', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 1, and `row` is a non-empty string**.
