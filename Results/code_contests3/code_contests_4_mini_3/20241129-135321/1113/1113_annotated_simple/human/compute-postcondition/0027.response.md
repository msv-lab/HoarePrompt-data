According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index of `row`, which must be 8 in order for the loop to execute for the ninth time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 9. 

State: **`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is the original non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is the modified string.**
