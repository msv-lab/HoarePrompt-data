To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop with respect to the initial state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `row` is the last non-empty string after stripping whitespace.
- `nRow` is initialized as an empty string.

The loop iterates over each character in `row`. For each character `i`:
- If `i` is '9', `nRow` appends '1'.
- If `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `nRow` will contain the modified version of `row` where every occurrence of '9' is replaced with '1', and all other characters are retained as they are.

Therefore, regardless of the specific content of `row`, `nRow` will reflect this transformation.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
