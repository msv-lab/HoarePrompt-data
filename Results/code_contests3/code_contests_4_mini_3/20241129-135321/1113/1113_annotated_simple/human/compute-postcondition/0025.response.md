To analyze the final state after all iterations of the loop, we note that `row` is a non-empty string, and the loop processes each character in `row`. For every character in `row`, if the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the current character `i` to `nRow`. 

Given that the loop continues until all characters in `row` have been processed, we can conclude the final state of `nRow` will be a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', while all other characters remain unchanged.

Thus, after the loop has executed for all characters in `row`, the output state would be:

Output State: **`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the last index of `row`, `row` is the original non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's.**
