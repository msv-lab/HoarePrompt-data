Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; if `i` is '9', then `nRow` now ends with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, with `i` being the next character in `row`.***
