The code `nRow += i` adds the value of `i` to `nRow`. The variable `i` is the second element in `row`, which is a non-empty iterable. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value or the exact result of the addition. The other variables (`res` and `row`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the second element in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the second element in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i.**
