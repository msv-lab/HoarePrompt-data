The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 10 modified strings, and `nRow` has been calculated by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will contain 11 modified strings (the original 10 plus the new value of `nRow`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.**
