The variable `nRow` is modified by appending the value of `i` to its previous value. The value of `i` is taken from the `row` iterable, and since `nRow` is modified by appending, its new value will be the concatenation of its previous value and `i`. The `res` and `row` variables remain unaffected in terms of their contents, but their previous states are still relevant for context. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is modified by appending `i`, and `i` is the next value from `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is modified by appending `i`, and `i` is the next value from `row.**
