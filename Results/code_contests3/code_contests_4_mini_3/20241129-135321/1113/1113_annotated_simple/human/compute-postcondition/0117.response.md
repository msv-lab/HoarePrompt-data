Postcondition: ***`nRow` is '11' if `i` is '9' for the loop to execute a second time with at least one more character after '9', and `i` will be the next character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is '19' if `i` is '9' for the loop to execute a second time with at least one more character after '9', and `i` will be the next character in `row`.***
