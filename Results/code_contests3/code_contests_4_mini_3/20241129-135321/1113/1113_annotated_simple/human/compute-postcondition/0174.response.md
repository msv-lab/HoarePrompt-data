The code appends the string '1' to `nRow`. Since the previous value of `nRow` is not provided, it will now contain whatever its previous content was plus '1'. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` must contain at least 12 characters, `i` is the 12th character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` must contain at least 12 characters, `i` is the 12th character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.**
