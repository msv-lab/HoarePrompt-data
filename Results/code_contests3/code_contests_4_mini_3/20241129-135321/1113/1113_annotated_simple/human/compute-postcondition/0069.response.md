The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it is currently being set to an empty string. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned from standard input; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `i` is 8; `row` is the last non-empty string after stripping whitespace; `nRow` is an empty string.
