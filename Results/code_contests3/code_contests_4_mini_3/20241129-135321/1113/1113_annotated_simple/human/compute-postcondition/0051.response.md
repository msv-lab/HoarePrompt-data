The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, after executing `nRow += '1'`, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string**
