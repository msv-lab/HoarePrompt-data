The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, and it is not affected by any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been modified by appending '1' to it, while `res` and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the second element in `row`, and `nRow` has been modified by appending '1' to its previous value.**
