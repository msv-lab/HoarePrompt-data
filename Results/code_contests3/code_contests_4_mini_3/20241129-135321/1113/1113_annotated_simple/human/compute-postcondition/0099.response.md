According to the code, the ability of the loop to execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty iterable, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is either '11' or `i` concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is based on the addition of `i`. The variable `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, and the variable `row` remains a non-empty iterable.

To adjust for the next iteration:
- The variable `i` will take the next value from `row`.
- The condition that `row` must be non-empty will continue to hold true for the loop to execute again.

Since the exact nature of `i` and `row` is not specified beyond being non-empty and iterable, we can conclude that after this iteration, `i` will be updated to the next element in `row`.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `i` has moved to the next value in `row`, and `nRow` should also reflect any changes that depend on the new value of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is either '11' or equal to `i` concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated based on the addition of `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, and `row` remains a non-empty iterable.**
