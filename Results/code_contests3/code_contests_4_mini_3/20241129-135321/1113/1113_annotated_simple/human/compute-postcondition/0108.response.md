According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over `row`, and for it to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. The current state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string, which does not affect the loop's execution. However, `i` is already set to 9, which is not relevant in this context as it will be overwritten by the loop.

For the loop to execute the first time, `row` must be a non-empty string, and `i` will represent each character in `row` during the iterations.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains previous values, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
