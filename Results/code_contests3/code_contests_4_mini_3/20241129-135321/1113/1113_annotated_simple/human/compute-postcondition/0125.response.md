According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the current iteration index, and we need to account for one more execution. 

Assuming `t` starts at 0 for the first iteration, after the last iteration, `t` would be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be 1 and `T` must be greater than 1.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is the last non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to the last row processed, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 1 and `t` is 1.**
