According to the code, the for loop will execute a total of 9 times, with the loop variable `i` ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have reached its maximum value of 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9. However, since the range specified in the for loop is `range(9)`, the loop will not execute again once `i` reaches 9, as the range only goes up to 8. 

Given that, the loop cannot execute any more times. Therefore, the relevant states must reflect that `i` has reached its limit and cannot continue.

State: **`nRow` is the result of concatenating each character from `row`, replacing '9' with '1'; `res` now contains the previous values along with the new value of `nRow` appended to it; `row` remains a non-empty iterable, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute no more times `i` must be less than 9.**
