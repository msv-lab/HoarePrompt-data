`res` is a list that will have `nRow` appended to it. The variable `nRow` is a string that has had every '9' replaced by '1', while other characters remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated state of `res` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string where every '9' is replaced by '1', and `res` now includes that updated string.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' is replaced by '1', `res` now includes that updated string**
