The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in the string `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but it will be updated by concatenating `i` to it. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `i` is the next character in `row`; `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character left; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `i` is the next character in `row`; `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`**.
