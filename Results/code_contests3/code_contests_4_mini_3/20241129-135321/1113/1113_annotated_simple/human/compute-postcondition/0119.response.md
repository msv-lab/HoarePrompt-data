The string `nRow` is concatenated with the character '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is '11', so after the execution, `nRow` becomes '111'. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '111', `i` will be the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is '111', `i` will be the next character in `row`**
