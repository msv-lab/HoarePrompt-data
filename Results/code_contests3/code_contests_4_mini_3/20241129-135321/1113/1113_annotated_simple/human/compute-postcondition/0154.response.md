According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` iterable. Since `row` is non-empty, it can execute at least one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` was increased by appending '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` was increased by the value of `i`. 

After the current iteration, `row` still has elements left. The next value of `i` will be the second element in `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be set to the next element in `row`, and `nRow` will be modified according to the new value of `i`.

State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the second element in `row`**.
