The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` does not have a prior value defined, we cannot determine its updated state. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its previous value, which is unknown; `input` is assigned from standard input; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `i` is 8; `row` is a non-empty string; the first character of `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its previous value (unknown); `input` is assigned from standard input; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `i` is 8; `row` is a non-empty string; the first character of `row` is '9'**.
