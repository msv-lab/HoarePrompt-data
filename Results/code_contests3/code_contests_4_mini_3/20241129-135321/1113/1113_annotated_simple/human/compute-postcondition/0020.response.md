Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by 1.***
