According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The variable `row` must be a non-empty string for the loop to iterate through its characters. As `i` starts at 1, it doesn't reflect the first character of the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least 1 character, and `i` should be adjusted to 0 to point to the first character in the string.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
