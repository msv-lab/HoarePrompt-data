According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it can execute again as long as there are more characters to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `i` is the current character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `row`, and the index of `i` would increase by 1.

If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1', and if `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is '0'. The next character in `row` (the next value of `i`) will determine the state of `nRow` for the upcoming iteration.

State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be the next character in `row`, and if `i` is equal to '9' then `nRow` will be '1', otherwise it will be '0'.**
