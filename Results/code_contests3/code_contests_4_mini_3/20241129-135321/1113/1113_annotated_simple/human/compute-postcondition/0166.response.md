The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The value of `res` containing 11 modified strings, the value of `row` as an input string after stripping whitespace, and the unchanged state of `nRow` prior to this assignment are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is now an empty string**
