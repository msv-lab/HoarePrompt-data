According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either '9' or the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is either 'nRow1'1 or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` must be either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the current character in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `row`, and `row` must have at least one additional character.

State: **`nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.**
