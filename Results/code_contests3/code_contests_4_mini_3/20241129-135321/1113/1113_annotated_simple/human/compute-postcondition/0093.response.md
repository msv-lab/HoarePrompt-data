The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first element of `row` (which is not equal to '9'), `nRow` will now contain the value of `i`. The variable `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, and the states of `row` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is the first element of `row`, which is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is now equal to `i`, `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is the first element of `row`, which is not equal to '9'.**
