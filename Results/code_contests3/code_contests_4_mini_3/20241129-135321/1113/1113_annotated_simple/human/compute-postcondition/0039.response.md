Postcondition: ***`nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is now either 'nRow1'1 or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` remains either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`, and `row` must contain more characters for the loop to execute again, with `i` being the next character in `row`.***
