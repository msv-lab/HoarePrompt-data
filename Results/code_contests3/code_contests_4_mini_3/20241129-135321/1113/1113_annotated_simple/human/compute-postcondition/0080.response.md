According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9'. If `row` has more elements, `i` will be incremented, allowing the loop to execute again. 

Since `i` is currently '9', for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 10 elements, and `i` will be updated to '10'. 

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1', resulting in its new value. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 10 elements and `i` will be '10'.**
