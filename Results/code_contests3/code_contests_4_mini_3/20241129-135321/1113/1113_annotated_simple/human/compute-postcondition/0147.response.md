The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`, which means that the previous value of `nRow` is overwritten. The other variables (`res`, `row`, `T`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is the user's input; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `nRow` is an empty string; `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is the user's input; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `nRow` is an empty string; `i` is 9**.
