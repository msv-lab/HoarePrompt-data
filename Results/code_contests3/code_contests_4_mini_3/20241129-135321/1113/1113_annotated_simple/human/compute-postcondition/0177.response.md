According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 13 characters, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains at least 12 characters, and `i` is the 12th character in `row`. For the loop to execute a second time, `row` must have at least 13 characters, and `i` will then be the 13th character in `row`.

State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` contains at least 13 characters, and `i` is the 13th character in `row`.**
