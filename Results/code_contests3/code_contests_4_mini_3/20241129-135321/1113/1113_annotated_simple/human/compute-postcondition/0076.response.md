According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which iterates over the `row`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next value in the `row`. 

Since it is stated that `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is increased by 8, we need to determine the current state of `nRow` based on the last value of `i`. 

If `i` was '9', then `nRow` has been appended with '1', and if `i` was not '9', then `nRow` increased by 8. Now, the loop should take the next element in `row`, and we need to ensure that `row` has more elements to iterate over.

Let's assume `i` is the last element in `row`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the next value in `row` and the total number of elements in `row` must be greater than the current index of `i`.

State: **`nRow` is updated accordingly based on the last value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have more elements, and `i` will take the next value in `row`.**
