The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous values of the other variables (`res`, `row`, `T`, `t`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is the new input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is '', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 1**
