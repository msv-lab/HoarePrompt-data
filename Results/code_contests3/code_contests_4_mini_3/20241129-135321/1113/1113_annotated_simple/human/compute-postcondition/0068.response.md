Output State: **`input` is assigned from standard input; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `i` is 8; `row` is the last non-empty string after stripping whitespace; `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to the last row; the loop is still limited to 9 iterations only.**
