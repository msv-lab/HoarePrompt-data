The loop processes each character in the `row` string. For each character, if it is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`. If it is any other character, it appends that character to `nRow`. After all iterations of the loop, `nRow` will be formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping the other characters unchanged. 

If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is a string where every '9' in `row` is replaced by '1', and other characters from `row` are retained.**
