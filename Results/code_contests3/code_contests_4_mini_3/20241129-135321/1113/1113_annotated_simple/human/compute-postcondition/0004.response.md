The variable `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and no other variables are impacted. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value of reading from the standard input stream using `io.BytesIO`; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the value of reading from the standard input stream using `io.BytesIO`; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity.**
