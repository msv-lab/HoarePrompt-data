Postcondition: ***`nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the value of `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is either 'nRow11' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1', while `i` remains as the next character in `row` with at least one more character for the loop to execute again. Otherwise, `nRow` is either 'nRow1' or increased by the character `i`, and `i` is the next character in `row` with at least one more character available in `row`.***
