According to the code, the loop executes based on the characters in the `row` string. The variable `i` represents the current character being processed from the `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is reset to 0, meaning the loop has not yet processed any characters from `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute at least once for each character in `row`.

If `i` is currently 0, it means the loop will start processing the first character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment to 1 after the first iteration. Since `nRow` is either '1' or '0' based on whether `i` equals '9', for the loop to execute a second time, `nRow` must be '0', which indicates that `i` is not yet 9.

Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1, and `nRow` will remain '0'.

State: **`nRow` is '0', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 1, and `row` is a non-empty string.**
