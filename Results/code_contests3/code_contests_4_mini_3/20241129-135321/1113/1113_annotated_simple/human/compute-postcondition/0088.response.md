The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect the other variables. The previous state of `nRow` was a string with every '9' replaced by '1', but it is now overwritten with an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` has been assigned a value from input, and `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, `row` has been assigned a value from input, and `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute a second time.**
