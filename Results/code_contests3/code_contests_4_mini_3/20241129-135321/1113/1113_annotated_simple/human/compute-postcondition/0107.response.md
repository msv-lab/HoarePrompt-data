The code initializes `nRow` as an empty string. It does not affect any of the previous state variables, including `res`, `row`, or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous values along with the new value of `nRow`, `row` is the user input string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the previous values along with the new value of `nRow`, `row` is the user input string, `i` is 9**.
