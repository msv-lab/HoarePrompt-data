According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is '1' and `res` is an empty string. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` equals `i`, and `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`. 

Assuming `row` remains a non-empty iterable, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next value from `row`. If `i` is currently '9', then the next value will be the next element in `row`, and `nRow` will still be '1' while `res` will remain an empty string. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` will be set to the next value of `i`, and `res` will be updated with the previous value of `nRow`.

State: **`nRow` is '1' or equal to `i`, `res` contains the previous value of `nRow`, for the loop to execute again `row` must remain a non-empty iterable and `i` will be the next element in `row`.**
