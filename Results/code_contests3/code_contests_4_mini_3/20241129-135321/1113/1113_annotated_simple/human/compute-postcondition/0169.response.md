`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 modified strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'**
