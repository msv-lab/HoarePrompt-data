The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is designed to handle multiple test cases of Sudoku solutions. Specifically, it will be called with an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) that indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 9 lines, with each line containing 9 characters that can be any digit from '1' to '9', representing a valid Sudoku solution. After processing these test cases, the function will return whether each Sudoku solution is valid or not.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases of Sudoku solutions and returns validation results for each test case, indicating whether the provided Sudoku solutions are valid.**
