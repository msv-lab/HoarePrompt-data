The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Initially, `nRow` is '01', so after the execution of the code, `nRow` becomes '011'. The values of the other variables `res` and `i` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '011', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`nRow` is '011', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 2**
