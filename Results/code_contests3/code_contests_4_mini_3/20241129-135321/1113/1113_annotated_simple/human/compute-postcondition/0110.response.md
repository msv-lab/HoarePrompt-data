`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` contains previous values, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` contains previous values, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'**
