Output State: **`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `i` is not equal to '9'; `nRow` is increased by `i`, but since `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged.**
