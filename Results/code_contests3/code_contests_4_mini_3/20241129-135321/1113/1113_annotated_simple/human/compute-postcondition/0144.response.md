The `res` list is modified by appending `nRow` to it. `nRow` is the modified string resulting from replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', and since `res` already contains 9 modified strings, after the execution, it will contain 10 modified strings. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, and `nRow` is the modified string resulting from replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `nRow` is the modified string resulting from replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'**.
