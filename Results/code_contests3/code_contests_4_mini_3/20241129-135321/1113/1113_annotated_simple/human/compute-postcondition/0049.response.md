According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in `row`, and for the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. Currently, `nRow` being an empty string does not affect the loop's execution directly, but the value of `row` is crucial. We also have `i` set to 9, which will be overwritten in the loop. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted: `row` must be a non-empty string, and since `i` will be reset to the first character of `row`, we can consider `i` as the starting index of the iteration, which will be 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the updated string, `i` is reset to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
