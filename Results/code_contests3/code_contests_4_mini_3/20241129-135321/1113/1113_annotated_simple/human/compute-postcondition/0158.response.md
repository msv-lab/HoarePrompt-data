According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `row`. If `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is '9'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next value from `row`. Since `nRow` was modified by appending '1' to its previous value because `i` was '9', we need to adjust `nRow` accordingly. So, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `row`.

State: **`res` contains 10 modified strings, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `nRow` is modified by appending '1' to its previous value, and `i` is the next value from `row`.**
