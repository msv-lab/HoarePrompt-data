`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The value of `res` still contains the previous value of `nRow`, which was an empty string. The values of `row` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `res` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is '9'**
