The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The variable `nRow` is formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's. Since `res` is initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is the modified version of `row`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains `nRow`, `i` is the last index of `row`, `row` is the original non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is the modified string.
