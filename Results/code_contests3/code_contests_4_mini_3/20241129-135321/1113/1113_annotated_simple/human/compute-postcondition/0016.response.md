Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` remains unchanged as `i` is 0.***
