The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Depending on its previous value, which can either be 'nRow1' or an increased version based on `i`, the new value of `nRow` will be either 'nRow11' or an updated string based on that previous value followed by '1'. The variable `i` and `row` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either 'nRow11' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'; `i` remains as the next character in `row`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`nRow` is either 'nRow11' or the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'; `i` remains as the next character in `row`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.**
