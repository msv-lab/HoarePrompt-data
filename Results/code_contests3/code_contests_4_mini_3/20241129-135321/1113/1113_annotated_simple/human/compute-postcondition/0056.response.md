`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '0', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '01'. The values of `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '01', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 1, and `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is '01', `res` contains the updated string, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string**
