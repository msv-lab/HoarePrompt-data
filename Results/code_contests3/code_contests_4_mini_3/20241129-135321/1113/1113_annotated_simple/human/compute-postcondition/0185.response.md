Output State: **`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `9 * T` modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1', `T` is the total number of outer loop iterations, `t` is `T - 1`, `row` is the last non-empty string processed after all iterations, `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to the last row processed; the output is the result of joining all strings in `res` with newlines and writing them to standard output.**
