The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the 13th character in `row`. The initial value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will be modified by adding the character `i`. Other variables, `res` and `row`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` contains at least 13 characters, and `nRow` is updated to include the 13th character `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 modified strings, `row` contains at least 13 characters, and `nRow` is updated to include the 13th character `i`.**
