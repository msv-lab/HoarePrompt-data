The variable `nRow` is reassigned as an empty string. The previous value of `nRow`, which was a string where every '9' is replaced by '1', is now lost. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is now an empty string; `res` contains the updated string; `i` is 9; `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`nRow` is now an empty string; `res` contains the updated string; `i` is 9; `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
