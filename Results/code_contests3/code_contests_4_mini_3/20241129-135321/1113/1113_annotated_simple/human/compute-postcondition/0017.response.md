According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the `row` string. The variable `i`, which is currently 0, will take the next character from `row` in the next iteration. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, meaning the first character of `row` has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 to 1, and the loop will process the second character of `row`.

State: **`input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 characters.**
