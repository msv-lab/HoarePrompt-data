#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function will be called with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, where each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters from '1' to '9' representing a valid Sudoku solution.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `input` is assigned from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `9 * T` modified strings where every '9' is replaced by '1' from the `9 * T` input rows, `T` is the total number of outer loop iterations, `t` is `T - 1`, `row` is the last non-empty string processed after all iterations, and `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to the last row processed.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of 9 lines, each containing a string of 9 characters (digits '1' to '9') representing Sudoku rows. It processes each row, replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1', and then outputs the modified rows for each test case. However, it does not validate the Sudoku solutions or check if they are valid solutions; it only modifies the input as described.
