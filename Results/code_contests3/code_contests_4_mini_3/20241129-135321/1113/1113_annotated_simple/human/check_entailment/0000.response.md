Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for creating an anti-sudoku from a correct sudoku solution. 

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Modification Limitations**: The problem states that at most 9 elements can be changed to make the original sudoku into an anti-sudoku. However, the program only changes the digit '9' to '1'. This means if the sudoku solution does not have enough occurrences of '9' (fewer than 9), the program will not be able to produce a valid anti-sudoku as it may not meet the criteria of having at least two equal elements in each row, column, and block.

2. **General Transformation**: The program only replaces the number '9' with '1' and does not address the requirement of ensuring that each row, column, and block contains at least two equal elements. There is no logic implemented to check or ensure that the final output meets the anti-sudoku criteria.

3. **Insufficient Logic**: The problem description allows for various ways to create an anti-sudoku. The code lacks flexibility and fails to explore or implement any of these alternatives. It does not evaluate the positions of numbers in rows, columns, or blocks to ensure the required repetition.

Given these points, the program does not adhere to the problem description's requirements and can lead to outputs that do not qualify as anti-sudoku solutions. Thus, it is incorrect.
