The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of 9 lines, each containing a string of 9 characters (digits '1' to '9') representing Sudoku rows. It processes each row, replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1', and then outputs the modified rows for each test case. However, it does not validate the Sudoku solutions or check if they are valid solutions; it only modifies the input as described.
