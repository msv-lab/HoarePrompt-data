`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it had some previous value (possibly an empty string or any other string). The output state will reflect that `nRow` is now updated to its previous value plus '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the second character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'.
