The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the 10th character in the non-empty string `row`. Since `row` is non-empty and has at least 10 characters, `i` has a specific value (the 10th character). However, the initial value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the combination of these values without specifying exact numerical results.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by adding the 10th character of `row`, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the 10th character in `row`.**
