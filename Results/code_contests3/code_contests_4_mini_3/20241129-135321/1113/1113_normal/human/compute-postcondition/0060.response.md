The value of `nRow` is increased by the string '1'. Since `nRow` is previously a numeric value (as it contains `nRow` plus its previous elements), adding a string '1' will result in a TypeError if attempted in a numerical context. However, since the prompt does not specify the type of `nRow`, we can assume that it can handle string concatenation.

After executing the code, `nRow` will become the string representation of its previous value concatenated with '1'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is `next_char`, and `nRow` is now the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'.
