The value of `nRow` is incremented by the current value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, and the current value of `i` is also unknown, but the operation indicates that `nRow` is updated. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is increased by `i`.
