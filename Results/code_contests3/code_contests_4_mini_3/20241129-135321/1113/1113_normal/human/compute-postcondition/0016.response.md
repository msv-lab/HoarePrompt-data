Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the string representation of `i`, which is "0" if `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
