The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `row` is a non-empty string, but it is now replaced by whatever input is provided by the user. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus `nRow`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is the user input string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and the loop has ended as `i` cannot be 9.
