Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases of valid Sudoku solutions formatted as 9 rows of 9 characters each. The function processes these inputs by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' in each row of the Sudoku solutions and outputs the modified rows. It does not validate the Sudoku solutions; it merely alters the character '9' to '1' and prints the resulting strings. **
