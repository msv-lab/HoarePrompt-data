The variable `nRow` is being assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` is not relevant since it was not defined before this assignment. The states of the other variables (`write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, `row`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 8, `row` is input string, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 8, `row` is input string, and `nRow` is an empty string.**
