The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `nRow`, and `i` is defined as the third character in `row`, which is a string containing at least 2 characters. Since `i` is a character, `nRow` will be incremented by that character. Therefore, the output state is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` contains at least 2 characters, and `i` is the third character in `row`; `nRow` is incremented by the character `i`.
