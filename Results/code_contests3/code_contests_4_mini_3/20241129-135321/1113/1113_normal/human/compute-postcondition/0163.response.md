The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` contains 19 strings. Since `nRow` is derived from `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', it will be a modified version of `row`. The value of `res` will now be 20 strings after the append operation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
