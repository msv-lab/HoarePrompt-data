To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the loop code and the initial state provided. 

The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For each character, if the character is '9', it appends '1' to the string `nRow`. If the character is not '9', it appends the character itself to `nRow`.

Given that:
- `row` is a non-empty string, we can assume it contains at least one character.
- The loop will execute once for each character in `row`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `nRow` will contain a string that replaces every '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged.
- The value of `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged as these are not modified by the loop.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes for all characters in `row` will be:
Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.**
