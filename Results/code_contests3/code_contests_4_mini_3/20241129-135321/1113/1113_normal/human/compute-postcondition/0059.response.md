According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not exhausted, the loop will execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', and `nRow` is increased by '1'. 

Now, the next character to be processed in the string `row` will be the one after '9'. Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to this next character, and `nRow` will be adjusted accordingly based on its value. 

Assuming `row` has at least one more character after '9', the loop will continue for the next character. Let's denote the next character after '9' in `row` as `next_char`. 

State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is `next_char`, and `nRow` is increased by the value of `next_char` (or by 1 if `next_char` is '9').**
