The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. However, the initial state does not provide the current value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact content after the operation. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is modified by appending '1', but we do not know its previous state.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to '9', and `nRow` has '1' appended to its previous value.**
