The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` plus `i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is a number less than or equal to 8, the resulting value of `nRow` will be the string representation of that number. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now a string representation of `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.
