Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, and if `i` is the 10th character of `row` and equals '9', then `nRow` is increased by the string '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the 10th character of `row` to its current value.***
