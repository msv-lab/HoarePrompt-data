Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` contains at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of the second character `i` in `row.***
