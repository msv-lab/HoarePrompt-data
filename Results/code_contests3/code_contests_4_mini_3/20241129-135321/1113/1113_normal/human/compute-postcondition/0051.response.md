`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is equal to '9' and is 8 (or lower) for the loop to execute the first time.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is equal to '9' and is 8 (or lower) for the loop to execute the first time.**
