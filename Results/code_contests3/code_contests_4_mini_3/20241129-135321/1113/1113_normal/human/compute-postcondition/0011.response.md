According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop is designed to iterate over each character in the `row` string. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character after stripping whitespace. 

Given the current state, `row` is an input string, and for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must not be an empty string. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` has at least one character.

State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**
