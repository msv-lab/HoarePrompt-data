Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
