After all iterations of the loop have executed, the `res` list will contain a total of 18 strings (the original 9 strings plus the 9 modified `nRow` strings). Each `nRow` will be formed from user input strings, replacing every '9' in those strings with '1'. The values of `write`, `maxint`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1.**
