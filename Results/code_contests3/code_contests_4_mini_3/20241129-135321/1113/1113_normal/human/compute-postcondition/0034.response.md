The operation `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` (which is 8) to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, the result of this operation will be the string representation of `i`, which is '8'. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now '8', `i` is 8.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now '8', `i` is 8**
