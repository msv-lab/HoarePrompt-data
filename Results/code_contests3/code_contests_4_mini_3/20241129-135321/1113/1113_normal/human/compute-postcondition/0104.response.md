The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The current state of `res` is a list containing 9 strings, and `nRow` is already defined as the string formed from `row` with all '9's replaced by '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `res` with the new string added.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (original 9 strings plus `nRow`), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, `nRow` is the string formed from `row` with all '9's replaced by '1'.**
