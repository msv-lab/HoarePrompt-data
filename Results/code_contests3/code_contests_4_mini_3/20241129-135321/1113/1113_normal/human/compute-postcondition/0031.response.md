Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now an empty string, `i` is 8, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must contain at least 1 character, and `i` is equal to '9'.***
