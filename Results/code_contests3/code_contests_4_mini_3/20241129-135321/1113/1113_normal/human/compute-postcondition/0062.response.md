Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is `next_char`, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is now the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `next_char` (or by 1 if `next_char` is '9').***
