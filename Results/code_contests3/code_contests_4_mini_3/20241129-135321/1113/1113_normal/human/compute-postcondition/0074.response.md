The operation `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the current value of `nRow` (which is an empty string) with the value of `i` (which is 0). Since `nRow` is an empty string, the result of this operation will be that `nRow` becomes the string representation of `i`, which is '0'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
