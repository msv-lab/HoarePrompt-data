The value of `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Given that the previous state does not specify the value of `nRow`, we can only state that its value is now `nRow + '1'`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` has been updated to `nRow + '1'`.
