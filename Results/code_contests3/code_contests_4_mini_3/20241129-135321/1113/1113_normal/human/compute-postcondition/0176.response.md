Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to contain '1' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`.***
