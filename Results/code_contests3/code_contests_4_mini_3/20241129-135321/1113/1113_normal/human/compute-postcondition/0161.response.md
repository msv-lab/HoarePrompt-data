Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is increased by concatenating '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
