The variable `nRow` is incremented by appending the string '1' to its previous value, which is currently an empty string. Therefore, `nRow` will now hold the value '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.**
