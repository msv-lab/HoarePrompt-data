According to the code, the loop is set to execute 9 times, with the variable `i` starting from 0 and increasing by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8. After the last iteration, `i` would be 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 9, which is the termination condition of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time (which would actually be the 10th execution overall), `i` must be 9.

State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9**
