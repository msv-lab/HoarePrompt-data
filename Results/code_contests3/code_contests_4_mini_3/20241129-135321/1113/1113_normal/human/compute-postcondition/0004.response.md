The variable `maxint` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. The other variables and the output function remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity**
