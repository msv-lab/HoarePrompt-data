The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes an input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `row` is a non-empty string, but the exact content is unknown as it depends on user input. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9.
