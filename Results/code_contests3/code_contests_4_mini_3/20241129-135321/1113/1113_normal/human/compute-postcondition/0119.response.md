The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that '1' is concatenated to the existing value of `nRow`. However, there is no prior state given for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact content before the operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `nRow` has been updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` contains at least 2 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.**
