The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the second character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.
