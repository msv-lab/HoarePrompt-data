The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means we are appending the character `'1'` to `nRow`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`. Since we do not know the previous value of `nRow`, we can assume it is an empty string or has some characters. The other variables remain unaffected during this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` will be the 10th character in `row`, with `nRow` being increased by the string `'1'`.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will be the 10th character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by the string '1'.**
