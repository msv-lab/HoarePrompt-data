The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after this operation, `nRow` will become '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 8, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 8, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
