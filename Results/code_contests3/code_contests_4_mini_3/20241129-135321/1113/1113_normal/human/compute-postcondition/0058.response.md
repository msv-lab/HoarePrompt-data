Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is increased by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
