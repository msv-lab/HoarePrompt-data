The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. However, since the initial state does not define `nRow`, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the third character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1'.
