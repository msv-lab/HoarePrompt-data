Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the third character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters; if `i` is '9', `nRow` is increased by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
