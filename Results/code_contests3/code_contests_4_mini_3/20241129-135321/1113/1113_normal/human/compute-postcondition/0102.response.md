Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, and `row` has at least one more character after `i`.***
