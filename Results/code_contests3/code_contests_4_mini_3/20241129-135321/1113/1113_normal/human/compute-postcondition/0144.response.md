The `append` method is called on the list `res`, which adds the value of `nRow` to the end of the list. The list `res` initially contains 18 strings, and the value of `nRow` has been defined as a string that is formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', while other characters remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will be updated to contain 19 strings.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
