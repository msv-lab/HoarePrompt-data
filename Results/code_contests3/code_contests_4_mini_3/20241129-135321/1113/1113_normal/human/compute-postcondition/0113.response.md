Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, and `t` is 1. If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, where `i` is any character other than '9'.***
