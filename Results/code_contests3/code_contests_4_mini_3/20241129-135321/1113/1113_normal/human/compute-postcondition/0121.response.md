Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` contains at least 2 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the character `i`.***
