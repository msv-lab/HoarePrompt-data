The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to `nRow`. The variable `nRow` is impacted by this operation, as it will now include the current value of `i`. The other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Since `i` is the next character in `row`, the value of `i` will depend on the current index in `row`, which is less than the length of `row` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is now updated to include `i`.
