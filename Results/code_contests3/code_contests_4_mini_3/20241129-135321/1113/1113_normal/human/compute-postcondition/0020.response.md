Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is now updated to `nRow + '1'`. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
