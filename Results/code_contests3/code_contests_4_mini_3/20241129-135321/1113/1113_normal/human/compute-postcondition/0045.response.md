The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous state indicates that `res` is a list that already contains `nRow`, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1'. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be added to the existing elements in `res`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a string with characters, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters the same.**
