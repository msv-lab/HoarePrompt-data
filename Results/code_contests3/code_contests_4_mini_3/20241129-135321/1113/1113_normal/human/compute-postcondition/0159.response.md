`nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + '1'`, which means that '1' is concatenated to the end of the current value of `nRow`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the third character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `nRow` is increased by concatenating '1'.
