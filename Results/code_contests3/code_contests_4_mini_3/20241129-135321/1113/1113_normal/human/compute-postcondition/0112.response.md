In the provided code, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', it will retain its value which is any character other than '9'. The initial state of `nRow` is an empty string. After appending `i` to `nRow`, `nRow` will now contain the character value of `i`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is any character other than '9'.**
