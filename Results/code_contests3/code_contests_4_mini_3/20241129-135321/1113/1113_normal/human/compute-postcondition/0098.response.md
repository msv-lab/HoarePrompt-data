Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to `i + '1'`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, where `nRow` is initially equal to `i` (or '1' if `i` is '9').***
