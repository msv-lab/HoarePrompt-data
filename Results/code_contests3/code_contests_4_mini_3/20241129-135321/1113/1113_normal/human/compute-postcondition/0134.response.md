Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 18 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` has '1' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`.***
