The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, concatenating it with '1' results in `nRow` being '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.
