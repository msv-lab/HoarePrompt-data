The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `res` will now contain one element, which is the value of `nRow`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters the same.**
