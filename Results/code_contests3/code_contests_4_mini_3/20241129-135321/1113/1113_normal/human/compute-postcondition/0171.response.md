`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 0, the result of this operation will still be an empty string (as adding 0 to an empty string results in an empty string). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is 0.**
