The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, where `i` is the second character in `row`. Since `row` must contain at least 2 characters for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is a valid character. However, the specific values of `nRow` and `i` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is increased by the second character `i` in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is increased by the second character `i` in `row**
