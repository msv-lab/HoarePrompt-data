To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the provided loop code and understand how it modifies the variable `nRow`.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For each character `i`:
- If `i` is equal to '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If `i` is not equal to '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

Given that the initial state indicates `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute once for each character in `row`. 

After all iterations, the variable `nRow` will contain:
- A '1' for every '9' found in `row`.
- Every other character from `row` as they are.

If `row` contains no '9's, `nRow` will simply be the same as `row`. Conversely, if `row` consists entirely of '9's, `nRow` will consist of '1's equal to the number of '9's in `row`.

Since `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution, they will retain their initial values.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and keeping all other characters unchanged.**
