The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
