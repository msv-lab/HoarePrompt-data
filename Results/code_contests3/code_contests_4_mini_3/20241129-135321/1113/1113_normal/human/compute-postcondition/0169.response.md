The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, appending '1' to it results in `nRow` becoming '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `row` is '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 20 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `row` is '9'.**
