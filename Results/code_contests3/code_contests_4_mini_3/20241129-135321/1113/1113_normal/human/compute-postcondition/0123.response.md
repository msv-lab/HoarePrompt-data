The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The variable `res` initially contains 10 strings, and now it will contain 11 strings after the operation. The other variables (`write`, `maxint`, `T`, `t`, `row`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` contains at least 1 character, and `nRow` is the concatenation of all characters from `row`, replacing every '9' with '1'.
