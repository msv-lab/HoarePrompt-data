The variable `T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, and `T` is an input integer.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer**
