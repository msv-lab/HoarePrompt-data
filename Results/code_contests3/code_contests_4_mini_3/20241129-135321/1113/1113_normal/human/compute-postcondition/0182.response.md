The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The state of `res` will change as an additional string (which is `nRow`) is added to it. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 21 strings (20 original strings + 1 new string `nRow`), `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 21 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'**.
