Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow` plus its previous elements, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now an empty string, `i` is equal to '9' and is 8 (or lower) for the loop to execute the first time.***
