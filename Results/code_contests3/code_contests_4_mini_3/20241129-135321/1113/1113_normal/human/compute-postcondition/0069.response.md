The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The other variables are not affected, and since `nRow` has no prior value to consider, it simply becomes an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; `row` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `nRow` is an empty string.
