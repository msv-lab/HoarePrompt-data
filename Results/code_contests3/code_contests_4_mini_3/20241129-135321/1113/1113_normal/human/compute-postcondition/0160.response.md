The value of `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is the third character in `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters. Therefore, `i` is a specific character from `row`. The state of `nRow` will change based on the value of `i`, but we do not know the exact value of `nRow` prior to this operation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the third character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.**
