The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of the other variables, including `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `i`, and `row`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**.
