The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9', but its specific value is not provided. When concatenating an empty string with `i`, the result will just be the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `nRow` is now equal to `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty user input string, `nRow` is equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
