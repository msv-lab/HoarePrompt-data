The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the other variables, `write` and `maxint`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, and `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, and `res` is an empty list.**
