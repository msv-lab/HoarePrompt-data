According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is iterating from 0 to 8 in the given range. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have reached 8 (the last value in the range for the loop). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9. However, since the range is set to 9, there are no more iterations for `i` to take on a value of 9.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be 9, but it will not execute again as the loop condition is not satisfied. 

State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus `nRow`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', for the loop to execute again `i` must be 9 (but it cannot be as the loop has ended).**
