`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string '1' is appended to the existing string `nRow`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, so we do not know its previous state. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.
