The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input consisting of an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each comprising 9 lines of 9 characters that represent a valid Sudoku solution. Each character is a digit from '1' to '9' without any whitespace.

The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the validity of the Sudoku solutions provided in each test case. The specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, but it can be inferred that the function verifies the Sudoku solutions and returns an indication of their validity.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer t representing the number of test cases followed by t test cases of valid Sudoku solutions and returns a result indicating the validity of each Sudoku solution.**
