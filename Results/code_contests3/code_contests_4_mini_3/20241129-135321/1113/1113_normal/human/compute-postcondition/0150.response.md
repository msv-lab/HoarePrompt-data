`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 19 strings, `T` is greater than 2, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.
