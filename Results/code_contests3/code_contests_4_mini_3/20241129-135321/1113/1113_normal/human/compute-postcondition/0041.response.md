The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown since it is part of the initial state as a list. However, we know that after execution, `nRow` will contain its original elements followed by the character '1' at the end. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
