Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is updated to '8'.***
