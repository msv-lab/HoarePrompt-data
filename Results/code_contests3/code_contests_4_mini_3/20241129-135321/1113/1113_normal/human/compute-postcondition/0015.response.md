In the code snippet provided, `nRow` is being concatenated with the value of `i`. The previous state indicates that `nRow` is currently an empty string, while `i` is a number (since it is not equal to '9'). Therefore, `nRow` will now hold the string representation of `i` after the operation.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is now equal to the string representation of `i` (which is "0" if `i` is 0), and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
