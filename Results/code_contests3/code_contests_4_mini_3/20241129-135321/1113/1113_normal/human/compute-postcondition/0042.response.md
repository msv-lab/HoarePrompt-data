The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the next character in `row`, and since `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is a valid character. However, the impact of adding a character to a numeric variable (`nRow`) is not defined without knowing the type of `nRow`. Assuming `nRow` is numeric, adding a string character to it would typically result in an error in Python. Therefore, we cannot determine a valid output state without additional information about the type of `nRow`. 

If `nRow` is a string and we are concatenating `i`, then `nRow` would be effectively updated with the character `i` appended to it, but this contradicts the assumption that it is numeric due to its initial context.

Given that `nRow` is initially set and the operation is adding `i` to it, the output state is ambiguous unless defined otherwise.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated with the next character `i` from `row`, but the type conflict may lead to an error.**
