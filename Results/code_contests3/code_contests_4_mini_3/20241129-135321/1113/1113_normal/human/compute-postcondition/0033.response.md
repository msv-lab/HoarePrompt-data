Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now an empty string, `i` is 8, and `i` is not equal to '9' (i.e., `i` is a numeric value, specifically 8)***
