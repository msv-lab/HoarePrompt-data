The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will now be '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'**.
