The variable `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The initial state does not provide the value of `nRow`, but since it is being modified, we know it will now have '1' appended to whatever it was before. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.
