`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is derived from `row` by replacing every '9' with '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus the new string `nRow`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.
