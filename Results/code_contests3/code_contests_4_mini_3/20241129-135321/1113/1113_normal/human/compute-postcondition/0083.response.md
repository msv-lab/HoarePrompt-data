Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include `i`, the next character in `row`.***
