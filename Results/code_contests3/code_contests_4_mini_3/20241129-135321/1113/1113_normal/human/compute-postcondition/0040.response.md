According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take on the next character in `row`. Therefore, `row` must still be a non-empty string, and `i` will be the next character in the string.

State: **`write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
