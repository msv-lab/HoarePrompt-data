#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases where each test case consists of 9 lines of 9 characters representing a valid sudoku solution, with each character being a digit from '1' to '9' without any whitespace.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `9 * T` strings formed by replacing each '9' in the input rows with '1', `T` is the input integer, `t` is `T - 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases of valid Sudoku solutions formatted as 9 rows of 9 characters each. The function processes these inputs by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1' in each row of the Sudoku solutions and outputs the modified rows. It does not validate the Sudoku solutions; it merely alters the character '9' to '1' and prints the resulting strings.
