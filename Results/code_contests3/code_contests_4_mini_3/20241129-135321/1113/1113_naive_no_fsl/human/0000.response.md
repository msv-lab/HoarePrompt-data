Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of transforming a valid Sudoku solution into an anti-Sudoku. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a 9x9 grid representing a valid Sudoku solution.
2. For each character (digit) in the Sudoku grid, if the digit is '9', it changes it to '1'; otherwise, it leaves it unchanged.
3. The resulting grid is then output as the transformed anti-Sudoku grid.

However, this approach fails to ensure that the resulting grid meets the requirements of an anti-Sudoku:

- Each row must contain at least two equal elements.
- Each column must contain at least two equal elements.
- Each 3x3 block must contain at least two equal elements.

### Example of a Failure Case:
Consider the input of a valid Sudoku grid:
```
154873296
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```
The program's output for this input would be:
```
154873196
386592714
729641835
863725149
975314628
412968357
631457982
598236471
247189563
```

In this output:
- The first row contains unique digits without any duplicates, violating the anti-Sudoku condition that requires at least two equal digits in each row.
- Similar checks for other rows and columns will show that the program does not satisfy the conditions for an anti-Sudoku.

Thus, the program does not handle the transformation correctly as per the requirements described in the prompt. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
