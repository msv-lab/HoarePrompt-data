Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from input. It then constructs a string consisting of the digit '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd, or an empty string if `n` is even. This string is printed to the output. The function does not return any value, and the specific role of the integer `m` and visitor ranges is not utilized in the code. **
