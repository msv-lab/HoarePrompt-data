The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as it is defined without any input parameters. However, the constraints indicate that it operates on variables `n`, `m`, and for each visitor `i`, it uses values `l_i` and `r_i`. 

Since `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 1000\), and for each visitor `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\), we can infer that `func` is likely designed to process data based on these values internally or through some other means not shown in the function signature.

The output behavior is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, without additional information about the output, we cannot determine what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters, but it operates on integers n and m (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000) and potentially processes visitor ranges defined by integers l_i and r_i (where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
