The values of `n` and `m` are assigned the integers obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which means they will receive input from the user. Since the specific values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can only state that they will be integers within the range specified (1 to 1000). Thus, the output state reflects that `n` and `m` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000**
