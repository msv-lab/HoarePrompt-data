The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on integers `n` and `m`, which are constrained to be in the range of 1 to 1000. Additionally, for each visitor `i`, there are pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` that also fall within the range of 1 to `n`, with the condition that `l_i` is less than or equal to `r_i`. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided details, so we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the constraints alone. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the given constraints of `n`, `m`, `l_i`, and `r_i`, but the specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates on integers n and m within the range of 1 to 1000, and pairs of integers l_i and r_i for each visitor i, where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
