Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of flowers) and `m` (the number of visitors), but it does not utilize the `m` parameter in its operations. It generates and prints a string of '10's for every pair of flowers (i.e., half of `n`), followed by '1' if `n` is odd. Therefore, the function outputs a string representing the arrangement of flowers based solely on the integer `n`, ignoring the visitor assignments entirely. **
