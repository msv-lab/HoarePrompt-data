The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on two positive integers, `n` and `m`, which represent the number of flowers and the number of visitors, respectively. Each visitor is represented by a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` that satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. 

The output varies based on the visitors' input pairs. The function will return specific results based on how the flowers are distributed among the visitors according to their specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function operates on the positive integer parameters n (number of flowers) and m (number of visitors), with each visitor defined by a range of integers; it returns results based on the interaction of visitors with the flowers they are assigned.**
