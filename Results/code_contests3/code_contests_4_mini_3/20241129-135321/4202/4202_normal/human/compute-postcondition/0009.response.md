According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters of the input received from `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute at least once, there needs to be at least one character provided in the input. The variables `pa`, `a`, `b`, and `pb` do not directly affect the execution of the loop as they are not involved in the loop's control structure.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the input. Therefore, the state should reflect that `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string. The loop variable `i` will then take the value of the first character in that input string.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that input string**
