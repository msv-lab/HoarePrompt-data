The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true, meaning if `i` is '1', `pa` will increase by 1. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. The output state depends on the previous value of `pa` and the value of `i`. Thus, if `i` is '1', `pa` becomes 2; if `i` is '0', `pa` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`**
