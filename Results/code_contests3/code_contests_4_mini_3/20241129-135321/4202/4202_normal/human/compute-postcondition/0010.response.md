The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The variable `i` holds the first character of the input string, which can either be '0' or '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', then `pb` will be increased by 1; if `i` is '0', then `pb` remains the same. The previous value of `pb` is 0. Consequently, `pb` will either be 1 or 0 after executing this line.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pb` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string**
