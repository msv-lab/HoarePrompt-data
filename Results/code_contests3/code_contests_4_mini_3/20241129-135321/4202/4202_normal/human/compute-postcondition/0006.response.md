In the given code, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` evaluates to `True`. The previous value of `pa` can either be 1 or 2, and the value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1', then `pa` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `pa` being 2 or 3. 
If `i` is not '1', then `pa` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state is conditional based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string; `pa` is either 2 or 3 if `i` is '1', or remains 1 or 2 if `i` is not '1'**
