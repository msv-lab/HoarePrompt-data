The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are 01-strings, meaning they are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1". The lengths of these strings are between 1 and 1000 characters inclusive. The function performs operations on these strings based on their binary nature. However, the specific output based on these inputs has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two 01-strings, `a` and `b`, of lengths between 1 and 1000 characters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are 01-strings of lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**
