The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` can be either 0 or 1. The value of `i` is the third character of the input string, which means `i` must exist. Therefore, `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pb` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the third character of the input string**.
