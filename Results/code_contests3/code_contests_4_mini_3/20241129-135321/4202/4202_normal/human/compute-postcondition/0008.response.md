The variable `pb` is assigned the value `0`. This means that `pb` is now explicitly set to `0`, while the values of `pa`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, and `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, and `pb` is 0.**
