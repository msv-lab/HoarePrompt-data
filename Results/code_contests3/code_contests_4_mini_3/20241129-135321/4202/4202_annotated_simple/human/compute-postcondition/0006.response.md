The code updates the variable `pa` based on the condition of whether `i` is equal to '1'. Since `i` is defined as the third character of the string returned by `raw_input()`, its value is either '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', then `pa` is incremented by 1; if `i` is '0', `pa` remains unchanged. The previous value of `pa` was either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `pa` based on the evaluation of `i`.

If `i` is '1', `pa` becomes 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1). If `i` is '0', `pa` remains the same as its previous value.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 1 or 2 or remains the same as 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, `i` is the third character of the string returned by `raw_input()`**.
