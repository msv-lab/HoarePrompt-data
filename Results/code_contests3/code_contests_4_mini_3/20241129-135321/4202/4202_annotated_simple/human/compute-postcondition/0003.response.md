According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string returned by `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the non-empty string returned by `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string.

Since `i` is the first character at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that there are more characters left in the string. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be the second character of the string returned by `raw_input()`. 

Assuming `raw_input()` returns a string of length greater than 1, `pa` will depend on the next character in the string (whether it's '0' or '1'). 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be updated to the next character in the string, and `pa` will be set accordingly.

State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on if the next character in the string is '1' or not; `i` is the second character of the string returned by `raw_input()`**
