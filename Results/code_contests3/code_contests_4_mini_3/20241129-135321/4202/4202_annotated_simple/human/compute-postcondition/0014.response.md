The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1', otherwise it remains unchanged. The previous value of `pb` is either 0 or 1, and it will be 1 if `i` is '1', and it will remain the same if `i` is '0'. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible new values of `pb` based on the comparison with `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is the count of '1's in the string returned by `raw_input()`, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, and `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
