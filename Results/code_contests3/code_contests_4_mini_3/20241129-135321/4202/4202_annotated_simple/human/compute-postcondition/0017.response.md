The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on two string inputs, `a` and `b`, which consist only of the characters '0' and '1', with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function likely processes these binary strings in some manner but does not provide explicit output information in the description. 

Since there is no output detail provided, we cannot ascertain the specific return value of the function related to the processing of `a` and `b`. Therefore, we cannot define a clear functionality statement based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
