The variable `pa` is assigned the value `0`. Other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is 0**
