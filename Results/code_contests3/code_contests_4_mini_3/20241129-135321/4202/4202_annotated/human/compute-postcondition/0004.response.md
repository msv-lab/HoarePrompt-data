The code `pa += i == '1'` evaluates the expression `i == '1'`, which checks if the value of `i` is equal to the string '1'. Since the initial state does not provide a value for `i`, we cannot determine the outcome of the evaluation. However, we know that `pa` is initially 0.

1. If `i` is '1', then `i == '1'` evaluates to `True`, which is treated as 1 in numeric context. Therefore, `pa` would be incremented by 1, resulting in `pa` being 1.
2. If `i` is anything other than '1', then `i == '1'` evaluates to `False`, which is treated as 0 in numeric context. Thus, `pa` would remain 0.

Since no specific value for `i` is provided in the initial state, we cannot definitively determine the final value of `pa`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`.**
