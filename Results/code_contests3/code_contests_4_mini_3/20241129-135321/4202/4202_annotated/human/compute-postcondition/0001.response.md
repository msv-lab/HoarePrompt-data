According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `raw_input()`. If there is at least one character input, the loop will execute. Since `a` and `b` are strings of '0' and '1', they do not directly influence the loop execution but may be relevant depending on the loop body. The variable `pa` being 0 does not affect the execution of the loop either.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there is at least one character inputted. Therefore, the initial state can remain as it is for `a`, `b`, and `pa`, but we must note that the input must not be an empty string.

State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input from raw_input() must be a non-empty string**.
