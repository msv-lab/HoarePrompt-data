According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input received from `raw_input()`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is input to process. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is '0', `b` is '1', and `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to reflect the next input line from `raw_input()`. 

Since the loop reads from `raw_input()`, we can assume that if the user provides another input, `i` will increment accordingly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be updated to the next value based on the input provided.

State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be incremented to the next input from raw_input()**
