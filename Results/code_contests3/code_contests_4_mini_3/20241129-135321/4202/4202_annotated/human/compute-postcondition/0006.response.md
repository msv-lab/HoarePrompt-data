The expression `pa += i == '1'` checks if `i` is equal to the string `'1'`. If it is true, the expression evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to 1, and `pa` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not equal to `'1'`, it evaluates to `False`, which is equivalent to 0, and `pa` remains unchanged.

The variable `pa` can either be 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Thus, if `i` is '1', `pa` is incremented by 1; if `i` is not '1', `pa` remains the same. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can conclude that:

- If `i` is '1', `pa` becomes `pa + 1`.
- If `i` is not '1', `pa` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state must reflect the possible values of `pa` based on the condition of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, after execution `pa` is either 1 or remains the same**.
