The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` can either be 2 or 1, depending on the current value of `i`. If `i` is '1', then `pb` will increase by 1, making it either 3 or 2. If `i` is not '1', `pb` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is greater than or equal to 0, `pb` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is greater than or equal to 0, `pb` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `i`**
