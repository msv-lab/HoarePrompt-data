The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Given that `pb` is initially 1 if `i` is '1' and 0 otherwise, the new value of `pb` will be either 2 (if `i` is '1') or 1 (if `i` is not '1'). The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is greater than or equal to 0, `pb` is either 2 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be the second character of the input string.
