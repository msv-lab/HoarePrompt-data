The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings consisting solely of the characters '0' and '1', with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function processes these input strings and returns a result based on the defined operations. However, since the specific output behavior is not provided in the output section, we can't detail the exact return value or conditions.
