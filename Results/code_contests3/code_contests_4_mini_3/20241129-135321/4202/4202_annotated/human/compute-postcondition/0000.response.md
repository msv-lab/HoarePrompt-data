`pa` is assigned the value `0`. Since the initial state indicates that `a` and `b` are strings consisting solely of the characters '0' and '1', and there are no other operations affecting other variables, the output state reflects only the assignment to `pa`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of '0' and '1'; `pa` is 0.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of '0' and '1'; `pa` is 0**
