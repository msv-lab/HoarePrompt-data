The variable `pb` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of other variables, `a`, `b`, and `pa`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0**
