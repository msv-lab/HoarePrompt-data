The code assigns new values to `n` and `k` by reading them from input. The previous values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged until the input is processed. The values of `n` and `k` will be updated to integers provided by the user through `raw_input()`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now set to the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
