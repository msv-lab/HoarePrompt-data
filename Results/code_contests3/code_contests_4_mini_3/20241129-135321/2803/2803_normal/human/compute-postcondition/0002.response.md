The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `n` and `k` are integers with the conditions that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. However, since the function does not explicitly take these parameters as inputs, we cannot determine how they are utilized or what output they may produce without further information on the function's behavior or return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output cannot be determined without additional context.**
