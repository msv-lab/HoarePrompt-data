Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates and prints `2` raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 1. If `k` is equal to 1, it simply prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters directly and its output is determined by the values of `n` and `k` processed from the input. **
