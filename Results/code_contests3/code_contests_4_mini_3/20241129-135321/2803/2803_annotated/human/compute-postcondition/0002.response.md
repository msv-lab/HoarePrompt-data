The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters according to the given signature. However, based on the constraints mentioned (that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18), it can be inferred that `n` and `k` must be provided or defined within the context of the function.

Since there is no output specification provided regarding what the function returns, we cannot describe the return values or the conditions under which different outputs might occur.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully determinable without more information about its behavior or return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters explicitly but relies on the existence of integers n and k, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
