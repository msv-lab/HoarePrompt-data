The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is then split into two parts and converted to integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, we can conclude that `n` and `k` will be updated to the values provided in the input as long as they follow these constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` have been updated but does not specify their exact values since they are based on user input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to new integer values based on input, satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
