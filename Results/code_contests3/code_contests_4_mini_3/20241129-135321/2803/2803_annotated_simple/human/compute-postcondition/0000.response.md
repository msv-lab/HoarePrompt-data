The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by splitting the input received from `raw_input()` and converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that both `n` and `k` are already integers within the specified range (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18). Hence, after execution, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided, but the exact values are unknown.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated based on input integers within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
