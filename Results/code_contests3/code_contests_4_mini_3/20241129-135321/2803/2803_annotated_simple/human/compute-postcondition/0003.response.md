Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18) from user input. It returns `n` if `k` is equal to 1; otherwise, it calculates and returns `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which represents the maximum power of 2 that can be formed with the binary representation of `n`. If `k` is greater than 1, the function does not consider any edge cases related to the input range. **
