The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, based on the provided constraints, it implies that the function operates with two integers, `n` and `k`, where the relationship is defined as 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, without additional information on the output based on the parameters, the functionality cannot be clearly defined. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
