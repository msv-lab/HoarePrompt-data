The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: 

1. `N`, which is an integer satisfying the constraint \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\).
2. `K`, which is a non-negative integer satisfying the constraint \(0 \leq K \leq 200000\).
3. `H`, which is a list of integers where each element \(H[i]\) (for \(1 \leq i \leq N\)) is in the range \(1 \leq H[i] \leq 10^9\).

Based on the output provided, the function behavior is not explicitly defined in terms of cases, but it processes the input parameters and returns a value based on them. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N, a non-negative integer K, and a list of integers H, and it processes these inputs to return a result based on them.**
