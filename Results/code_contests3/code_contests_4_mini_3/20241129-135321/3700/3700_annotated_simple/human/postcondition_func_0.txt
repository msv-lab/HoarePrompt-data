The function accepts two integers, `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. If this sum is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning it. If `a + b` is less than `mod`, it returns `a + b` directly. There are no checks for the validity of the input ranges beyond the stated constraints.
