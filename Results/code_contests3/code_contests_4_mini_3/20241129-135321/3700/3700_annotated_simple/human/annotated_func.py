#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000. Additionally, there is a list of integers representing the health of each monster (H_i) such that 1 <= H_i <= 1000000000 for each monster.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is an integer representing the number of monsters (N); `b` is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K); `c` is `a + b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to `a + b - mod`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of c, which is either a + b or a + b - mod if a + b is greater than or equal to mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. If this sum is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning it. If `a + b` is less than `mod`, it returns `a + b` directly. There are no checks for the validity of the input ranges beyond the stated constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each H[i] (1 <= i <= N) is in the range 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers, `N` is the length of `H`, and `s` is the sum of integers from a new input list. If `s` is greater than or equal to the values in list `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N and a list of integers H from user input. It then calculates the sum of another list of integers from user input and checks if this sum is greater than or equal to H. If the sum is greater than or equal to H, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. Note that the variable K is mentioned in the annotations but is not utilized in the function, indicating a possible missing functionality or misunderstanding in the annotations.
