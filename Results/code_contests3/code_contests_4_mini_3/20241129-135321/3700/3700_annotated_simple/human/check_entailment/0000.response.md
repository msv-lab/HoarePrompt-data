Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attack actions needed given a number of monsters and their healths, along with a limited number of special moves. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not implement this logic. `func_1` simply returns the sum of two numbers after a conditional check that is unrelated to the problem at hand. `func_2` attempts to read input and checks if the sum of a new input list is greater than or equal to another list `H`, but it does not calculate the required number of attacks or apply the logic of special moves effectively.

2. **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_2` is incorrect. It tries to read input for `H` and `N`, but it does not properly assign `H` as a list of health values. The line `H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]` fails to correctly separate the health values from `N`.

3. **Missing Calculation Logic**: The core logic to determine the minimum number of attack actions is completely absent. The problem requires a calculation that considers both the total health of the monsters and how many special moves can be used to bring their health to zero. The program does not compute this.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. It fails to accurately calculate the number of attacks needed to defeat the monsters given their health and the constraint on special moves.
