The function accepts two integers, `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), calculates their sum, and returns this sum adjusted by a global variable `mod` if it exceeds or equals `mod`. If the sum is less than `mod`, it returns the sum directly. The function does not handle the case where `mod` is not defined or not initialized, which could lead to a runtime error.
