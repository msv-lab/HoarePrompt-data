Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, and `s` is the sum of the integers from the input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed, indicating that `s` is less than the sum of the integers in `H`.***
