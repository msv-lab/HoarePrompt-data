Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `H` and computes the sum `s` of a list of integers inputted afterward. It checks if this sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H` and prints 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it is not. The function does not utilize the parameters `N` and `K` in its logic, and it also lacks error handling for cases where input may not adhere to the expected format. **
