#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of monsters N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200,000), b is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves K (0 ≤ K ≤ 200,000), followed by a list of integers representing the health H_i of each monster (1 ≤ H_i ≤ 1,000,000,000).
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is an integer representing the number of monsters N, `b` is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves K, and `c` is assigned the value of `a + b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to the value of `a + b - mod`, which is greater than or equal to 0.
    return c
    #The program returns the updated value of c, which is the sum of the number of monsters a and the maximum number of Special Moves b, adjusted by the value of mod if necessary, ensuring that c is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), calculates their sum, and returns this sum adjusted by a global variable `mod` if it exceeds or equals `mod`. If the sum is less than `mod`, it returns the sum directly. The function does not handle the case where `mod` is not defined or not initialized, which could lead to a runtime error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, and `s` is the sum of the integers from the input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the sum of the integers in `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed, indicating that `s` is less than the sum of the integers in `H`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `H` and computes the sum `s` of a list of integers inputted afterward. It checks if this sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H` and prints 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it is not. The function does not utilize the parameters `N` and `K` in its logic, and it also lacks error handling for cases where input may not adhere to the expected format.
