You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Fennec is fighting with N monsters.

The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

Fennec can do the following two actions:

* Attack: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will decrease by 1.
* Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.



There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.

Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.

Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
H_1 ... H_N


Output

Print the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.
