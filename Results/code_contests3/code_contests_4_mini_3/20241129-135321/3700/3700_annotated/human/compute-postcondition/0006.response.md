Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers, `N` is the integer representing the length of `H`, and `s` is the sum of integers obtained from a new input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the total of integers in list `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the total of the integers in list `H`, 'No' is printed, and no changes are made to the values of `H`, `N`, or `s`.***
