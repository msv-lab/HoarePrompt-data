The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it relies on external variables or inputs that should conform to specific constraints. According to the provided constraints, `N` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 200000 \), `K` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq K \leq 200000 \), and `H` is a list of `N` integers where each \( H_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9 \).

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the prompt, so we cannot determine the exact return value without additional information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but relies on external variables N, K, and H, where N is an integer within the range 1 to 200000, K is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 200000, and H is a list of N integers each between 1 and 10^9. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
