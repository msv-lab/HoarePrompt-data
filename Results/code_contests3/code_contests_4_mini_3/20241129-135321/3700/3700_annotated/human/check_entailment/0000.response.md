Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. 

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attacks needed to bring all monster healths to zero, given that Fennec can use a limited number of special moves. However, the functions provided (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not implement this logic:
   - `func_1` simply returns the sum of two integers and does not address the health of the monsters or the special moves.
   - `func_2` reads integers from input and checks if the sum of another input is greater than or equal to a single integer `H`, which is not relevant to the problem of defeating monsters.

2. **Missing Logic**: There is no handling of the monster healths or the utilization of special moves in the provided code. The problem description requires a specific algorithm to compute how many attacks are needed after possibly using some special moves. The provided functions do not address this at all.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not consider edge cases, such as when `K = 0`, where Fennec cannot use any special moves. The correct implementation should explicitly handle cases where the health of monsters is significantly high compared to the allowed special moves.

Since the provided code does not follow the problem description and fails to implement the necessary logic to solve the problem, I conclude that it is incorrect.
