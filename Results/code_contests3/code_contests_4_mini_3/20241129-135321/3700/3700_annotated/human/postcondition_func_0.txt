The function accepts two integers, `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is greater than or equal to a predefined constant `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum to ensure the result is non-negative. There is no handling for the potential case where `mod` is not defined or has not been initialized.
