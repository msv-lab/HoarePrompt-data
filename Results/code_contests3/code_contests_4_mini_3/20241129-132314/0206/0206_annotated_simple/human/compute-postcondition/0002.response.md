To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved. 

1. `np.max(a)` finds the maximum value in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `N` integers represented as strings, these strings will need to be converted to integers to find the maximum value properly.
2. `np.min(a)` finds the minimum value in the list `a`, similarly requiring the conversion of strings to integers.
3. Then, `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values found in the list.

Since `N` is specified to be a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers, the output will depend on the specific values within `a`. However, since we are not given specific values for `a`, we can only describe the result in general terms.

The output state will reflect that:
- `ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the integers in list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers as strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.**
