The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take input as a string, split it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assign that list to `a`. The initial state indicates `N` is a positive integer and `a` is an empty list before this assignment. After executing the code, `a` will contain the input values split into a list. The previous value of `N` does not affect the assignment directly, but it informs that the input will contain `N` integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers as strings.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers as strings.**
