The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will perform operations based on the input values of `N` and `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `a`, while ensuring that the constraints on `N` and the elements of `a` are upheld.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a list of N integers a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each integer a_i).**
