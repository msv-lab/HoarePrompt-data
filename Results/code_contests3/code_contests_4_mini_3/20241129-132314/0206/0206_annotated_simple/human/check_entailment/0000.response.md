Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement. While it calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which gives the distance between the two furthest houses, it does not account for the fact that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any position. 

The minimum distance to be traveled should be the total distance covered from the furthest house at one end to the furthest house at the other, which is indeed the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates. However, the function does not correctly handle the input format as the function is missing the necessary imports and uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it should use `input()` instead). 

Moreover, the variable `a` is read as strings and not converted to integers before calculating the maximum and minimum values. The correct approach would involve converting the elements of `a` from strings to integers.

In summary, while the logic of calculating the distance between the furthest houses seems correct, the program contains incorrect input handling and format issues that would lead to failure in execution. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
