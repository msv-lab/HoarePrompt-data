To execute the provided code snippet, we first need to analyze the initial state and the operations being performed.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 100 \).
   - `a` is a list of `N` strings obtained from input.

2. **Code snippet**:
   ```
   ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
   ```

3. **Impact of the code**:
   - The code uses NumPy functions to find the maximum (`np.max(a)`) and minimum (`np.min(a)`) values of the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the absolute difference between these two values and assigns it to `ans`.
   - Since `a` consists of strings, we assume that the strings can be compared, and the max and min functions will work based on lexicographical order.

4. **Previous values**:
   - The values of `a` are strings, and their maximum and minimum will depend on the specific strings present in the list.
   - The output of `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will result in two strings, which will be subtracted (after converting to a numerical representation if necessary).

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - If we consider the strings in `a`, the result of `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` will determine the numerical difference in their lexicographical order.

Since we don't have the specific values of `a`, we can't compute an exact numerical output for `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in `a` based on lexicographical order.**
