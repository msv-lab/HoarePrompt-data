Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer N from input, followed by a list of N integers. It calculates and prints the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., if N does not match the number of integers provided) or where the input contains non-integer values. **
