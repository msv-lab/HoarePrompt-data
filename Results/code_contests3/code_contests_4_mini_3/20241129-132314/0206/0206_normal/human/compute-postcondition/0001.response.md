The value of `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes a space-separated input string and splits it into a list of strings. Since `N` is a positive integer that indicates the number of integers in the list, the list `a` will contain `N` string elements. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings obtained from input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings obtained from input.**
