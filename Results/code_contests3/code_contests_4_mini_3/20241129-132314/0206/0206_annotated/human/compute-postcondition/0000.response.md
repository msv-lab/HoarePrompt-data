The value of `N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input as a string. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 1 and 100, but since the input is taken as a string, `N` remains a string after this operation. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input string representing an integer between 1 and 100, and `a_i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an input string representing an integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` is a list of N integers where each a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000) represents the coordinates of the houses.**
