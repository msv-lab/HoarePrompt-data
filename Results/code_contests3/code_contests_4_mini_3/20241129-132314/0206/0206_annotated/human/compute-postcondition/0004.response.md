The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the provided signature. However, the context implies that it utilizes a list `a_i` of integers that represent the coordinates of houses, with the constraints that `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\) and each \(a_i\) (where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 1000\)) represents the coordinates of the houses.

Based on the output requirements, the function likely processes these coordinates in some manner. However, without specific return conditions or cases defined in the output, we can only summarize the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing coordinates of houses and operates within the constraints of N being between 1 and 100, and each coordinate value being between 0 and 1000.**
