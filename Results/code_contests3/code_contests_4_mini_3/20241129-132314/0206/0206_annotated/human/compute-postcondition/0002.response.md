To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the operation being performed.

1. The variable `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `N`. Each element of `a` represents a coordinate of a house.
2. The code snippet calculates `ans` as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

However, since `a` is a list of strings, we need to convert these strings to integers before applying `np.max()` and `np.min()`. 

Assuming the list `a` can be converted successfully to integers, `np.max(a)` will give the maximum integer value in the list and `np.min(a)` will give the minimum integer value. The absolute difference will then be calculated.

Thus, the output state will depend on the maximum and minimum integer values derived from the string representations in `a`.

Output State: **`N` is an input string representing an integer between 1 and 100; `a_i` is a list of `N` integers where each `a_i` (0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000) represents the coordinates of the houses; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a` converted to integers.**
