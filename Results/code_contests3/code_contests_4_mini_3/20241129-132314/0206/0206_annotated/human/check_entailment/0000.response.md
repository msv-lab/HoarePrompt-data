Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, the correct function is `input()`. This makes the program non-functional in a standard Python 3 environment.

2. **Output Requirement**: The problem description specifies that the program should print the minimum distance to be traveled. However, the program computes the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which is effectively the range of the coordinates, not the minimum distance to travel. The minimum distance to be traveled should be the distance between the farthest two houses, which is correctly represented by `max(a) - min(a)`.

3. **Input Type Handling**: The program does not convert the input coordinates from strings to integers. The variable `a` is a list of strings, which is incorrect because the calculations (`np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)`) are expected to operate on integers.

4. **No Return Value**: The function does not return any value. While it prints the result, the problem description does not specify that output should be done this way. It should ideally return the computed minimum distance.

In conclusion, the program incorrectly handles input data types and has compatibility issues with Python 3. It does not accurately compute and print the minimum distance as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it fails to follow the problem requirements in multiple aspects.
