Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. 

1. **Data Type Handling**: The input values from `raw_input()` are strings and should be converted to integers before performing any calculations. The program currently uses `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` on a list of strings, which will not return the correct numerical maximum and minimum values.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance calculation `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` is intended to find the minimum distance AtCoDeer needs to travel, but it does not account for the requirement that he can start and end his travel at any position. The correct approach should be to find the distance between the furthest apart houses because that represents the range he must cover. 

An example where the program fails is:
- Input:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
Expected Output: `7` (distance from house at 2 to house at 9)
Actual Output: The program will likely raise an error or give incorrect output due to string handling.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
