To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements:

1. For each query represented by a positive integer \( n_i \), the task is to find the maximum possible number of composite summands that can sum up to \( n_i \).
2. If no such composite summands exist, the output should be -1.

The program provided is as follows:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Handling Odd Values**:
   - If \( a \) (the input number) is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets \( c = 1 \). This is an attempt to make \( a \) even since all composite numbers (other than 4) are even.

2. **Checking for Small Values**:
   - It checks if the adjusted value of \( a \) (after potentially subtracting 9) is in the set \( (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) \). If it is, it prints -1, indicating that no valid composite summands can be formed.

3. **Calculating Maximum Summands**:
   - If \( a \) is not in the small numbers set, it calculates the number of summands as \( a / 4 + c \), where \( c \) is either 0 or 1 depending on whether 9 was subtracted.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle cases where \( n_i < 4 \) correctly. Specifically:
  - For \( n_i = 1, 2, 3 \): The expected output is -1, which is handled correctly.
  - However, for \( n_i = 4 \): The code would output \( 4 / 4 + 0 = 1 \), which is correct because 4 can be represented as itself, but it doesn't consider that 4 is the smallest composite number.
  - For \( n_i = 5, 7, 9, 11 \): The output will be -1, which is correct as these cannot be split into composite summands.
  - For \( n_i = 6 \): The program will output \( 6 / 4 + 0 = 1.5 \), which is incorrect since maximum summands should be 1 (i.e., 4 + 2 or 6 as a single composite number).
  
### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle cases for \( n_i = 6 \) and other even numbers that can be represented as the sum of composites but are not accounted for properly in the logic used to calculate the number of summands.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the case when \( n_i = 6 \), where it should output 1 instead of 1.5.
