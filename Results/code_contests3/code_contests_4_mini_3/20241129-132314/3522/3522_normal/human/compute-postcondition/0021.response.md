To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, we will analyze the conditions and operations that take place.

1. The initial value of `c` is 0.
2. The condition checks if `a` is odd and equal to 9. If this condition holds true, `c` would be set to 1. However, since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we cannot make a determination about `c` without knowing `a`.
3. The code snippet evaluates the expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c`. This means:
   - If `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`, it will output `-1`.
   - If `a` is not in that tuple, it will compute `a / 4 + c`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `a`, we cannot determine the precise output, but we can outline the possible outcomes based on the value of `a`:

- If `a` is any of the values in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `a` is not in that set, the output will be `a / 4 + c` (where `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `a`).

Thus, the output state will reflect the conditions and potential values.

Output State: **`a` is the input value; `c` is 0 if `a` is not odd and equal to 9; output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
