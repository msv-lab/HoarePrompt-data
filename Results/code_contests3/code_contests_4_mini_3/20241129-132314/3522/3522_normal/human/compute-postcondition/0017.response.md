The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, which changes its previous state. The previous state of `c` was either `1` or `0`, but after this assignment, `c` is definitively `0`. The variable `a` remains unchanged and is still the input value. The loop's ability to execute another iteration is now determined by the value of `c`, which is now `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input value, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is the input value, `c` is 0**
