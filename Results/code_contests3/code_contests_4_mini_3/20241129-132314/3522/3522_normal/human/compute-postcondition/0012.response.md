The value of `c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, and the values of `q` and `a` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the input value decreased by 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the input value decreased by 9; `c` is 1**
