The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5. For each query `ni`, it is a positive integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. The function processes these queries and returns a result based on the values of `ni`. However, the specific output based on the queries is not provided in the prompt. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries and process each query `ni`, which is also a positive integer, returning a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries and processes each positive integer query `ni`, returning results based on these inputs.**
