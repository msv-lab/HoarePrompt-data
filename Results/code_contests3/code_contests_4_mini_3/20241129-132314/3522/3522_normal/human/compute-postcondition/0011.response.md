`a` is reassigned the value of `a - 9`. Since `a` is an input value, its specific value is unknown, but it will be decreased by 9. The values of `q` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the input value decreased by 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the input value decreased by 9; `c` is 0**
