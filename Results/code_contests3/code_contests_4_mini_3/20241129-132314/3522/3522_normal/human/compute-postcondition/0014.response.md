To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to examine the variable `a` and determine its value (odd or even) in relation to the conditions provided in the initial state. Depending on whether `a` is odd or even, `c` will be set accordingly, which will influence the output of the print statement.

1. If `a` is odd:
   - `a` is decreased by 9.
   - `c` is set to 1.

2. If `a` is even:
   - `c` remains 0.

Now, let's evaluate the print statement:
- It checks if `a` is in the set of values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11):
  - If true, it prints `-1`.
  - If false, it computes the expression `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `c` can either be 0 or 1, the output will depend on the value of `a` after the conditions are applied.

Since `a` is not specified as a particular value, we can't definitively determine the output without knowing whether `a` is odd or even, and its specific value. However, we can outline the possible outcomes based on the conditions set.

Output State: **`a` is odd; `c` is 1, output is -1 or `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`; or `a` is even; `c` is 0, output is -1 or `a / 4`.**
