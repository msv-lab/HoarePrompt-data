`c` is assigned the value 0, which changes its previous value of 1. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is assigned an input value; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is assigned an input value; `c` is 0**
