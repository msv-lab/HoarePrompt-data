Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query `a`, it checks if `a` is odd and, if so, subtracts 9 from `a`. It then returns -1 if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. Otherwise, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is 1 if `a` was odd and 0 if `a` was even. This function effectively processes up to 100,000 queries, each being a positive integer up to 1 billion, and produces the corresponding output based on the defined conditions.**
