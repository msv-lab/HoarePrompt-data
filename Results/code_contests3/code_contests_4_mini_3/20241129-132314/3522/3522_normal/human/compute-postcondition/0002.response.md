The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The values of `q` and `a` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0**.
