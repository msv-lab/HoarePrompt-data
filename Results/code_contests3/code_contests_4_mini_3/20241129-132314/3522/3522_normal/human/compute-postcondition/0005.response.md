The value of `c` is assigned the value 1. The value of `q` and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string reduced by 9; `c` is 1; the value of `a` is an odd number.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string reduced by 9; `c` is 1; the value of `a` is an odd number.**
