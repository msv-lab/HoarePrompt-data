To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the code, the problem requirements, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to represent a given positive integer `n_i` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1 if there are no such splittings. A composite number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is not prime.

### Program Code:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query `a`, it checks if `a` is odd and, if so, subtracts 9 from `a`. It then returns -1 if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. Otherwise, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is 1 if `a` was odd and 0 if `a` was even.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program handles odd numbers by subtracting 9, which is a composite number, and increments a counter `c`. However, for certain values of `a`, specifically if after subtraction the value becomes one of the cases in {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, it will return -1.
   - If `a` is less than 9, subtracting 9 will make it negative, which leads to undefined behavior since negative numbers are not composite.

2. **Valid Composite Numbers**: The smallest composite number is 4, and any number less than 4 cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.

### Specific Cases:
- If `a = 1`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 2`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 3`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 4`, it is not explicitly handled since `4/4 + 0 = 1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 5`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 6`, the output is `1`, which is correct (6 can be represented as 4 + 4).
- If `a = 7`, the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- If `a = 8`, however, the output is `2`, which indicates it can be represented as two 4s, which is correct.
- If `a = 9`, the output will be `-1` since after subtracting 9, it becomes 0 and not in the composite range.

### Output Hints Validation:
The hints indicate that the values returned are based on the conditions provided in the program. They seem to agree with the code, but we should be cautious about values like `9` or any odd number less than `9` which could lead to an incorrect interpretation by returning negative or incorrect values.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle all edge cases, particularly for numbers just below composite values (e.g., 4, 6, 8) or certain odd numbers. Specifically, the handling of negative results and the fact it does not account for all possible composites is an issue.

Thus, there are indeed cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
