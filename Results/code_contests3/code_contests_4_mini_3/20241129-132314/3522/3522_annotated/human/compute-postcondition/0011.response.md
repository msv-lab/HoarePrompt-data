The value of `a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its current value. The variable `result` is not affected, and `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value minus 9; `result` is not updated; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input value minus 9; `result` is not updated; `c` is 0**
