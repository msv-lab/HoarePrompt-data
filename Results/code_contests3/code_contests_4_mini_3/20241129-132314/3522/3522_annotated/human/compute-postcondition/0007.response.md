The `print` statement evaluates the condition based on the value of `a`. Since `a` is specified to be an even integer, it cannot be among the odd integers in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Therefore, the else clause is executed. 

The value of `c` is set to 1 if `a` is odd, but since `a` is even, `c` is not assigned any value and remains undefined in this context. However, we can infer that `c` is implicitly 0 in this case since it is only set when `a` is odd, and will thus not affect the output.

The expression `a / 4 + c` evaluates to `a / 4 + 0`, which simplifies to `a / 4`. 

Thus, the output will be the result of `a / 4`.

Output State: **`a` is an even integer; result is `a / 4`**
