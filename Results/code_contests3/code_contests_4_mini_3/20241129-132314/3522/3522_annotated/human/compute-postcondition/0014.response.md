To determine the output state, we must first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state provides that `a` is an input value, with conditions based on whether `a` is odd or even.
2. If `a` is odd, it will be updated to `a - 9`, `result` will remain unchanged, and `c` will be set to 1.
3. If `a` is even, `result` remains unchanged and `c` remains 0.
4. The print statement will output `-1` if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it will output `a / 4 + c`.

Since we do not have a specific input value for `a`, we must consider both scenarios (odd and even) for our output state. 

- If `a` is odd and `a` is updated to `a - 9`, `c` is set to 1. The output will depend on whether the updated `a - 9` is in the set or not.
- If `a` is even, `c` remains 0, and the output will depend on whether `a` is in the set or not.

Since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we will represent the results in a general form.

Output State: **`a` is an input value; if odd, `a` becomes `a - 9`, `c` is 1; if even, `c` is 0; output is `-1` if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
