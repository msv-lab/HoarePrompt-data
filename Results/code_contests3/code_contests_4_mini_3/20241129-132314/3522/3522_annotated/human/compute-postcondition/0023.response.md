The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it handles a number of queries, denoted as `q`, where `q` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100,000. For each query, it processes an integer `ni`, which is also a positive integer constrained between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The function returns results based on the queries processed, but the details of these results are not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle multiple queries specified by the positive integer `q` and process each corresponding positive integer `ni` in the range specified.

Functionality: **The function handles a number of queries specified by a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 100,000) and processes each query with a positive integer ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 1,000,000,000).**
