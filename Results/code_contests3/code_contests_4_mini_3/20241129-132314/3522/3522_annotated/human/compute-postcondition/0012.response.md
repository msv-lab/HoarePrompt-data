The value of `c` is assigned the value 1, changing it from its previous value of 0. The other variables `a` and `result` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value minus 9, `result` is not updated, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is an input value minus 9, `result` is not updated, `c` is 1**
