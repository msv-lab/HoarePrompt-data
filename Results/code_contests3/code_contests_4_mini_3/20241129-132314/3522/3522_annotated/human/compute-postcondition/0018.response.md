The value of `a` is decremented by 9, and since `a` is an input value that may be odd or even, the new value of `a` will be either odd or even, depending on its previous state. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value (odd or even) decreased by 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input value (odd or even) decreased by 9; `c` is 0**
