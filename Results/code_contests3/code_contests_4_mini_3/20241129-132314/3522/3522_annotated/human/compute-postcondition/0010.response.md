The value of `c` is initialized to 0, but no other variables are affected by this assignment. The state of `a` remains as an input value, and `result` is still not updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value; `result` is not updated; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input value; `result` is not updated; `c` is 0**
