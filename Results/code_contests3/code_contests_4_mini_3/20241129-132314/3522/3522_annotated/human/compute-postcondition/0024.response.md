Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input q, representing the number of queries. For each query, it checks the value of a positive integer a. If a is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets a counter c to 1. It then checks if the adjusted a is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, the output is -1; otherwise, it calculates and outputs a / 4 + c. The function processes up to 100,000 queries with values of a that can be as large as 1,000,000,000. **
