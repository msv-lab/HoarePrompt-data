To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided Python code based on the initial conditions of variable `a`.

1. **Identifying the state of `a`:** 
   - `a` is an input value that may be odd or even. 
   - If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1. 
   - If `a` is even, `c` remains 0.

2. **Code execution:**
   - The expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c` checks if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`.
   - If `a` is in that tuple, it prints `-1`.
   - If not, it computes `a / 4 + c`.

3. **Impact on variables:**
   - Depending on whether `a` is odd or even, `c` will either be 1 (if `a` is odd) or 0 (if `a` is even).
   - The output will depend on the value of `a` and its membership in the specified tuple.

Since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we can conclude the output state in terms of the possibilities for `a` being odd or even.

Output State: **`a` is an input value that may be odd or even; if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0; print -1 if `a` in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c**
