`c` is assigned the value `0`, but the previous value of `c` was determined based on the parity of `a`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value that may be odd or even; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input value that may be odd or even; `c` is 0**
