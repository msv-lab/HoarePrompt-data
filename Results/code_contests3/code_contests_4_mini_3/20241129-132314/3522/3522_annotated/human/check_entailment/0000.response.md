Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Handling of Odd Numbers**: The program subtracts 9 from the input `a` if it is odd and sets a counter `c` to 1. However, this adjustment does not guarantee that the resulting number can be expressed solely as a sum of composite numbers. For example, if `a` is 13, after subtracting 9 it becomes 4, which is composite, but the program will output `1` because it will compute `4 / 4 + 1`, which equals `2`. This is incorrect as the maximum number of composite summands for 13 should be 2 (i.e., 4 + 4 + 5).

2. **Incorrect Outputs for Certain Values**: The program checks if the adjusted `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to print `-1`, which means it considers these values as outputs that cannot be split into composite summands. However, it fails to account for all scenarios where a number greater than 11 could also not be split into valid composite numbers. For instance, the program does not correctly handle the case for `ni = 6`, which should output `1` (as it can be split into `4 + 2`, but 2 is not composite).

3. **Division and Integer Output**: The program uses integer division (`a / 4`) which in Python 2.x produces a float output. However, the expected output is an integer, and this could lead to incorrect results when summands are calculated.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Checks**: The program does not systematically ensure that all valid composite summands are accounted for. Just checking the adjusted `a` against a small set of numbers does not cover all cases.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description correctly as it miscalculates the number of composite summands and does not provide the correct output for various cases. The reasoning behind the calculations is flawed and does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
