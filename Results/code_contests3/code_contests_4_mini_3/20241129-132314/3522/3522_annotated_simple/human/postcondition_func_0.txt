The function accepts a positive integer `q`, representing the number of queries, and processes `q` positive integers `a`. For each integer `a`, if it is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets a counter `c` to 1. It then checks if the modified (or unmodified) `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, returning -1 for those values. Otherwise, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`. The function handles up to 100,000 queries, but does not explicitly check the range of `a` for each query, so it assumes valid input as per the problem statement.
