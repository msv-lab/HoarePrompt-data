To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. The variable `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9. This means that `a` can take any value greater than or equal to 1 (as it is positive), but since it has been reduced by 9, `a` must actually be at least 9 (to keep it positive).
2. The variable `c` is set to 1 if `a` is odd, and 0 if `a` is even.
3. The print statement checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. If not, it computes `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9, let's analyze the possible values for `a`:

- If `a` is odd: The possible odd values of `a` that are greater than or equal to 9 could be 9, 11, 13, etc. If `a` is 11, then `c` would be 1, and since 11 is in the set, it would print -1. If `a` is 13, then `c` would still be 1, and since 13 is not in the set, it would evaluate `13 / 4 + 1 = 3.25 + 1 = 4.25`.
- If `a` is even: The possible even values of `a` that are greater than or equal to 9 could be 10, 12, 14, etc. If `a` is 10, then `c` would be 0, and since 10 is not in the set, it would evaluate `10 / 4 + 0 = 2.5`. If `a` is 12, then it would also evaluate `12 / 4 + 0 = 3`.

Thus, we have various outcomes depending on the specific value of `a`:

- If `a` is 9, 11, it prints -1.
- If `a` is 10, it results in 2.5.
- If `a` is 12, it results in 3.
- For odd values greater than 11 (like 13, 15, etc.), it computes the respective value.

However, since we do not have a specific input value for `a`, we cannot determine a single output state. Instead, we can summarize the possible outcomes based on the conditions given.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, 0 if `a` is even; outputs are -1 for `a` in (9, 11), or `a/4 + c` otherwise.**
