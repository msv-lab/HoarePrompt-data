`c` is assigned the value of 0. There are no changes to the other variables `q` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input positive integer; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input positive integer; `c` is 0**
