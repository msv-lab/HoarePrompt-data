The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. This directly affects the value of `c`, but does not change the value of `a`, which remains as a positive integer reduced by 9. The condition for `c` being 1 or 0 based on the parity of `a` is overridden by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is 0**
