The function `func` does not directly accept any parameters as its signature does not include any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it processes `q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and for each query `ni`, which is also a positive integer.

The function handles multiple queries based on the constraints provided:
- Case_1: If `q` is a positive integer that falls within the range 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, it processes the queries.
- Case_2: Each query `ni` must also be a positive integer where 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9.

The output of the function will depend on the outcomes of processing the queries, but specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, and positive integers `ni` for each query, ensuring that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. The specific output based on the queries is not defined.**
