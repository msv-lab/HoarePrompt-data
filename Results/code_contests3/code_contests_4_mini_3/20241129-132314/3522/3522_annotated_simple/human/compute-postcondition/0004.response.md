The variable `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is a positive odd integer, after subtracting 9, `a` will still remain a positive integer (assuming `a` is greater than or equal to 9). The value of `c` and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a positive integer (now reduced by 9), and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a positive integer (now reduced by 9), `c` is 0**
