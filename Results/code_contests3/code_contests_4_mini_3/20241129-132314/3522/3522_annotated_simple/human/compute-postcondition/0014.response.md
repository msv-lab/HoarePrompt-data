To evaluate the provided code snippet, we first need to analyze the implications of the initial state on the variables involved.

1. The variable `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9. This means `a` must be at least 10 (since it is positive after reduction).
2. If `a` is odd, then `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0. 

Now, we need to check the output of the provided print statement based on the conditions given:

```python
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

- The condition `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)` checks if `a` is one of those specific values. Given that `a` must be at least 10, this condition will always evaluate to `False`.
- As a result, the code will execute the `else` part: `a / 4 + c`.

For `c`, we need to determine its value based on whether `a` is even or odd. Since `a` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 10, the possible scenarios are:

- If `a` is even (e.g., 10, 12, 14, ...), then `c` is 0.
- If `a` is odd (e.g., 11, 13, 15, ...), then `c` is 1.

In both cases, we compute `a / 4 + c`:
- If `a` is even, it becomes `a / 4 + 0 = a / 4`.
- If `a` is odd, it becomes `a / 4 + 1`.

Since `a` is not specified but must be at least 10, we summarize the output state based on these scenarios without needing specific values for `a`:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is either 0 (if `a` is even) or 1 (if `a` is odd); print outputs a/4 (if `a` is even) or a/4 + 1 (if `a` is odd)**.
