The variable `a` is assigned the value of `a - 9`. Since `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9, the new value of `a` will be the original value minus 9. The variable `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer reduced by 9; `c` is 0**
