`c` is assigned the value `0`, which directly sets `c` to `0`. The value of `a` remains unchanged and the previous value of `c` (which was either `0` or `1` depending on the parity of `a`) is now overridden. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input value, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input value, `c` is 0**
