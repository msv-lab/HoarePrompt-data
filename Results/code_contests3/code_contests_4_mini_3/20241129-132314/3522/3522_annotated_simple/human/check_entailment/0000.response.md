To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic and how it handles the inputs according to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given several queries, each containing a positive integer `ni`.
2. We need to represent `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands and return this maximum number, or `-1` if no such summands exist.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program processes multiple queries and checks each integer `a` (which is the input for each query) to determine how many composite summands can be formed from it.

1. **Handling Odd Numbers**: 
   - If `a` is odd, the program reduces `a` by 9 (to make it even) and increments `c` to 1, indicating that one composite number (9) is added to the sum.

2. **Checking for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the adjusted `a` is in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. If it is, the output is `-1`, meaning that `a` cannot be composed of composite numbers.
   - If `a` is not in that set, the program calculates the maximum number of summands as `a / 4 + c`. This is based on the fact that the smallest composite number is 4, allowing us to create as many 4s as possible from `a`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **For `ni < 4`**: The program correctly returns `-1` for numbers like 1, 2, 3, since they are less than the smallest composite number.
2. **For Odd Numbers**: The program effectively handles odd numbers by subtracting 9 to make them even, which is valid as 9 is composite.
3. **Composite Check**: The set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)` covers all small primes and numbers less than 4, ensuring that only composite sums are considered.
4. **Calculation of Number of Summands**: The formula `a / 4 + c` correctly computes the maximum number of 4s that can be summed and adds 1 if an odd number was reduced by 9.

### Edge Cases:
- For `ni = 6`, `6` can be expressed as `4 + 4`, which gives an output of `1`, aligning with the problem requirements.
- For `ni = 8`, `8` can be expressed as `4 + 4`, giving an output of `2`, which is also correct.
- For `ni = 12`, multiple combinations exist, but the program calculates for maximum summands correctly as `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic to satisfy the requirements of the problem description. It handles all specified edge cases correctly and computes the results as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is validated.

Correctness: **True**
