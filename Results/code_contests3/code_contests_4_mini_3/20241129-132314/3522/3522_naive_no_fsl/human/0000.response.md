To analyze the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic of the program and see if it meets all the requirements.

The goal is to find the maximum number of composite summands for a given integer \( n_i \).

### Key points from the problem description:
1. **Composite Numbers:** A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime (it has divisors other than 1 and itself).
2. **Valid Splittings:** For any integer \( n_i \), we must determine if it can be expressed as a sum of composite numbers. If so, we need to find the maximum number of such summands.
3. **Output:** If \( n_i \) cannot be expressed in this way, we output -1.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:
1. The code begins by processing multiple queries.
2. It checks if the number \( a \) is odd. If so, it subtracts 9 and adds 1 to the count of summands \( c \). This seems to be a strategy to handle odd numbers, which typically cannot be split into even composite numbers.
3. For numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, the code directly outputs -1 (since these numbers cannot be split into composite summands).
4. For other numbers, it calculates \( a / 4 + c \), which indicates the maximum number of summands.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly:
  - **For \( n_i = 9 \):** The code would subtract 9, resulting in \( a = 0 \), and then it would output \( 0/4 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 \), which is incorrect because 9 cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.
  - **For any odd \( n_i \) greater than 11:** After subtracting 9, the code does not check if the resulting even number can be represented as a sum of composite numbers correctly. For example, \( n_i = 15 \) would become \( 6 \) after the adjustment. The code would output \( 6/4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is incorrect since 6 can only be expressed as \( 4 + 2 \), and 2 is not composite.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, such as \( n_i = 9 \) and other odd numbers greater than 11. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to provide correct outputs for certain inputs, specifically odd integers and specific cases like 9 that cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
