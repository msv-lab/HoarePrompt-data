The code assigns the values of `n` and `V` by taking input from the user and mapping it to integers. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, the output state will reflect that these variables are now assigned user-provided integer values within their specified ranges. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `b` is a list of n integers where each integer bi satisfies 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100.**
