The values of `a` and `b` are both reassigned to new lists created from the input. The input consists of two lines, where the first line is split into floats for `a` and the second line is split into floats for `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are replaced with these new float values. The constraints on the integers in `a` and `b` do not change, but now they are represented as floats.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of n floats; `b` is a list of n floats.**
