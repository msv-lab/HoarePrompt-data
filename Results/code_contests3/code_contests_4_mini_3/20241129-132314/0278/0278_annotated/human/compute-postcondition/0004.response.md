The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and a positive integer `V` (where 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000). It also takes two lists of floats: `a` (of length `n`, where each element satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) and `b` (of length `n`, where each element satisfies 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100). The function calculates a minimum value by reducing over the list `a`, applying a lambda function that computes a minimum ratio of elements in lists `b` and `a`. The final result is the minimum obtained from the calculations, constrained by `V`. 

However, it is important to note that the function lacks proper handling for edge cases such as:
1. The input values for `b` could potentially be zero, which might lead to a division by zero error when calculating the ratio `ab[0] / ab[1]`.
2. The return type is not explicitly defined, nor is it returned; instead, it is printed directly.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integer parameters `n` and `V`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It computes a minimum value based on ratios of elements in `b` and `a`, but it does not handle potential division by zero errors and prints the result instead of returning it. **
