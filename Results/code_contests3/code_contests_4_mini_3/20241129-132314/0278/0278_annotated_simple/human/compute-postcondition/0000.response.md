Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `V` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `b` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 100. `n` and `V` are assigned the values from `raw_input()` split and mapped to integers.**
