In this case, `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26`, which means it is a non-negative integer and the result of `added_index % 26` will be in the range of 0 to 25. Since `index` is also between 0 and 25, `new_index` will also be between 0 and 25.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` is a string with at least 1 character; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, which is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26`; `new_index` is between 0 and 25 as a result of the modulo operation.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` is a string with at least 1 character; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, which is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26`; `new_index` is between 0 and 25.**
