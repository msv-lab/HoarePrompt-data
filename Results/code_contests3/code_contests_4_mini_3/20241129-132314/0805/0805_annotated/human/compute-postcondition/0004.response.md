According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `strings`. For the loop to execute at least once, `strings` must contain at least one character. Given that `S` is a string with a length between 1 and 10^4, it implies that `strings` is valid and will have at least one character. Additionally, the loop variable `s` will take on the value of the first character of `strings` during the first iteration. 

The state provided indicates that `N` is a non-negative integer, which does not directly impact the execution of the loop. However, `new_strings` starts as an empty string, but this does not affect the loop's execution either.

Therefore, to summarize the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute:

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a string with at least 1 character, `s` is the first character of `strings`, and `new_strings` is an empty string.**
