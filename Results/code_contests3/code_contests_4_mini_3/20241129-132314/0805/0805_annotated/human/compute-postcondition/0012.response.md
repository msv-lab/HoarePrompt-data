The value of `added_index` is assigned the result of `index + n`. The variable `index` is within the range of 0 to 25, and `n` is a non-negative integer that can range from 0 to 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` can range from `index` (when `n` is 0) to `index + 26` (when `n` is 26). However, since `index` can be at most 25, `added_index` can take values from 0 to 51. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 2 characters; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s` for the next character; `index` is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26`. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 2 characters; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s` for the next character; `index` is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26**.
