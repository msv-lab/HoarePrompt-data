The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`. Since `N` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 26, thus `added_index` will range between `index` (when `N` is 0) and `index + 26` (when `N` is 26). When taking `added_index % 26`, the result will be in the range of 0 to 25.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 3 characters; `s` is the third character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`; `new_index` is in the range of 0 to 25. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 3 characters; `s` is the third character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`; `new_index` is in the range of 0 to 25.**
