The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is known to be between `index` and `index + 26`, which means `added_index` can vary but will always yield a result between `0` and `25` when taken modulo `26`. Therefore, `new_index` will also be between `0` and `25`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 2 characters; `s` is the second character of `strings`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s` for the next character; `index` is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26; `new_index` is between 0 and 25.**
