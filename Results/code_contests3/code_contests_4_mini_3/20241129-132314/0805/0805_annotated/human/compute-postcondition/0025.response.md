Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `N` (0 <= N <= 26) and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters (length between 1 and 10,000). It shifts each character in the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and outputs the resulting string. **
