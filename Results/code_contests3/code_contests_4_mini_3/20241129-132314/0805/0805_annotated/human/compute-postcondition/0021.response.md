The value of `new_strings` is incremented by the value of `new_s`, which is assigned from `letters[new_index]`. The previous value of `new_strings` is unknown, but it now includes the value of `new_s`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, and `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`.

Output State: **`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`**
