The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is a non-negative integer that satisfies the constraint 0 <= N <= 26. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, with a length that can range from 1 to 10,000 characters. Based on the output description, the functionality of the function `func` involves processing these inputs in a way that depends on the value of `N` and the content of the string `S`. However, since the output conditions are not specified, we cannot determine the exact return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer N (0 <= N <= 26) and a string S (uppercase English letters, length between 1 and 10,000) but the exact return value is not specified.**
