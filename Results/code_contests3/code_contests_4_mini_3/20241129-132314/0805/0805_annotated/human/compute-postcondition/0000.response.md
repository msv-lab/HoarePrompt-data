The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and `S` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4; `n` is an input integer.**
