The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The variable `index` is between 0 and 25 and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` can range from `index` (when `n` is 0) up to `index + 26` (when `n` is 26). The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` is a string with at least 1 character; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, which is between 0 and 25; `added_index` is between `index` and `index + 26`.**
