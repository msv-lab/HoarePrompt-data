The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are used directly for the calculation, and since `N` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 26, `n` can take values within this range. The previous values of the affected variables are `index` (the position of `s` in `letters`) and `n` (the non-negative integer). Therefore, after execution, the value of `added_index` will be the sum of these two values.

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` has at least 3 characters; `s` is the third character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`.**
