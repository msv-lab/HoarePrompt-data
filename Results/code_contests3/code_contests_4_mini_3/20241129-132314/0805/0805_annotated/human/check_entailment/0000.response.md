Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from standard input, which matches the specifications given.

2. **Character Shifting Logic**: 
   - It uses a fixed string `letters` that contains all uppercase English letters in order.
   - For each character `s` in the string `S`, it finds the current index of `s` in `letters`, adds `N` to this index, and uses modulo 26 to wrap around if the new index exceeds 25 (which corresponds to 'Z'). This logic correctly handles the wrap-around behavior specified in the problem description.

3. **Output**: The program constructs a new string `new_strings` by concatenating the shifted characters and prints it, as required.

4. **Constraints**: 
   - The program only operates on valid inputs where `N` is in the range [0, 26] and `S` contains only uppercase letters with a length of up to 10,000 characters.
   - The use of `index` and `new_index` ensures that all characters are processed correctly, and since it directly maps to the alphabet, it adheres to the problem statement.

5. **Examples Verification**: The program has been designed to work correctly for the provided examples, including edge cases like shifting by 0 and the maximum shift value of 13 with the full alphabet.

In summary, the program meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description, ensuring that it reliably produces the expected output for all valid inputs.
