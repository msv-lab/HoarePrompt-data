Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads an integer `n` and a string `strings` from standard input. 

2. **Character Shifting**:
   - It uses a predefined string `letters` which contains all uppercase English letters in order.
   - For each character `s` in the input string `strings`, it finds the index of `s` in the `letters` string. This index corresponds to the position of the character in the alphabet.

3. **Index Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the new index by adding `n` to the original index and then taking the modulus with 26. This is crucial because it ensures that when the end of the alphabet is reached, it wraps around to the start (for example, going from `Z` to `A`).

4. **Building the Result**:
   - Each newly calculated character is appended to the `new_strings` variable, which constructs the final output string.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the resulting string is printed, which corresponds to the correctly shifted characters as required by the problem description.

The program handles edge cases properly, such as:
- A shift of `0`, which will return the original string unchanged.
- A shift of `26`, which effectively also returns the original string because of the wrap-around nature of the alphabet.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the specified requirements, and therefore, it is correct.
