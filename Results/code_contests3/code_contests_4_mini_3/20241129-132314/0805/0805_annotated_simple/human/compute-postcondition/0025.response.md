The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it reads input from the user, expecting an integer `n` (between 0 and 26) and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It processes this string by shifting each letter forward in the alphabet by `n` positions, wrapping around if necessary (i.e., if the shift exceeds 'Z', it continues from 'A'). The function then prints the resulting transformed string.

However, the function does not handle cases where the input for `n` is outside the expected range (such as negative numbers or values greater than 26) and does not validate the input for `strings` to ensure it consists only of uppercase letters. Additionally, while the function modifies the string based on the provided input, it does not return any value, which is a notable aspect of its implementation.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string of uppercase letters, shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions in the alphabet, and prints the transformed string. It does not validate inputs for ranges or letter cases and does not return any value. **
