The value of `index` is assigned the position of the character `s` in the list `letters`. The previous state indicates that `added_index` is `index + n + 1`, and `new_index` is `(added_index + 1) % 26`, but we do not know the actual value of `s` or its corresponding index in `letters`. Thus, the output state reflects that `index` has been determined but other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n + 1`, `new_index` is `(added_index + 1) % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`**
