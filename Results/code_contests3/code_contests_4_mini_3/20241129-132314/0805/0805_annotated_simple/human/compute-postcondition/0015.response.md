The variable `new_strings` is incremented by the value of `new_s`, which is defined as `letters[new_index]`. The values of `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are based on previous calculations. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `new_strings` after adding `new_s` to it.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, `new_strings` is updated by adding `new_s`**
