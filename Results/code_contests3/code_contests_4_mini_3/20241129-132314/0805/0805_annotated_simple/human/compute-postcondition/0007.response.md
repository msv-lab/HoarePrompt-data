To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first analyze the implications of the code:

1. `added_index` is a calculated value derived from `index + n`. 
2. `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, which effectively wraps around any value greater than 25 back into the range of valid indices for the string `letters`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `index` is the index of `s` in `letters` (which is a character from `strings`).
- `n` is an input integer in the range of 0 to 26.
- Thus, `added_index = index + n` could range from `index` to `index + 26`.

Calculating `new_index`:
- Since `added_index` could go from `index` to `index + 26`, the result of `added_index % 26` will yield a value between 0 and 25, effectively mapping any overflow back into the valid index range of `letters`.

Therefore, we summarize the output state based on the analysis above:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
