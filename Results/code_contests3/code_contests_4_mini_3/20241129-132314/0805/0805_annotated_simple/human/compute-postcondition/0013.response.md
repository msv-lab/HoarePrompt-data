The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. Since `added_index` is defined as `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**
