The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous value of `index` is determined by the position of the first character `s` of `strings` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer that satisfies 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be the result of adding `index` and `n`. The values of `S`, `N`, `strings`, `letters`, `new_strings`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`**.
