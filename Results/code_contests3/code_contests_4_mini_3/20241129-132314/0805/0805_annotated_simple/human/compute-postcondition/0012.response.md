The value of `added_index` is assigned the result of `index + n`. The previous value of `index` is unknown but is determined by the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer that can range from 0 to 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` will vary based on the values of `index` and `n`. 

Since `index` can take values from 0 to 25 (as it represents positions in a string of 26 letters), `added_index` can range from `index` (when `n` is 0) to `index + 26` (when `n` is 26). However, since `N` is capped at 26, we can say that `added_index` will be at least equal to `index` and at most `index + 26`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n` where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer.**
