The value of `new_index` is reassigned to `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is `index + n`, and since it is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_index`, but we know it will be a value between 0 and 25 (inclusive) due to the modulo operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`**
