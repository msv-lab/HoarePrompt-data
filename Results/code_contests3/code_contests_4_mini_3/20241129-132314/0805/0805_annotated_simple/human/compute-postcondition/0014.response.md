`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `new_index` is derived from the previous state as `added_index % 26`. The values of `added_index` and `new_index` are known from the initial state, but the result for `new_s` depends on the content of the `letters` list or string at the index `new_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`.

Output State: **`added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is `letters[new_index]`**
