Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character of the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order, handling the wrap-around from `Z` to `A` appropriately. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase letters.
2. It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
3. For each character in `S`, it finds its index in the `letters` string.
4. It calculates the new index by adding `N` to the current index and then taking the result modulo 26 to handle the wrap-around.
5. It constructs the new string by retrieving the character at the new index and concatenating it to `new_strings`.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting string.

The program is expected to function correctly for all valid inputs as defined by the problem constraints, including edge cases such as:
- When `N` is 0 (the output should be the same as `S`).
- When `N` is 26 (the output should also be the same as `S` due to the wrap-around).
- When the string `S` consists of letters near the end of the alphabet, such as `XYZ`.

Since the program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
