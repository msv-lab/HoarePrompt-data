`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` will determine the value of `added_index`. Since `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `index` must also be within this range (assuming `index` is a valid index for the string). Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of `index` and `n`, which could result in a value between `index` and `index + 26` depending on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is equal to index + n.**
