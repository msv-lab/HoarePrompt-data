The function `func` accepts a non-negative integer input `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each character in the string `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary (for example, shifting 'Z' by 1 results in 'A'). The function then constructs a new string `new_strings`, which contains the shifted characters, and prints this new string. 

However, the functionality described in the annotations is inaccurate. The function does not return an empty string if `n` is 0, nor does it return the first `n` characters of `S`. Instead, if `n` is 0, the output will be the original `strings` unchanged, as there is no shifting applied. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string of uppercase letters, shifts each letter in the string by `n` positions in the alphabet, and prints the resulting string. If `n` is 0, the original string is printed unchanged. **
