The code `print(new_strings)` outputs the value of `new_strings`, which was previously calculated as the result of each character in `strings` shifted by `n` positions in the alphabet. The values of `S`, `N`, and `n` do not change with this command. Therefore, the Output State focuses on the value of `new_strings` that has been computed.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `new_strings` is the result of each character in `strings` shifted by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.**
