The variable `added_index` is defined as `index + n`. The calculation of `new_index` takes the value of `added_index` and applies the modulus operation with 26, wrapping around if the value exceeds 25. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index found in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.
