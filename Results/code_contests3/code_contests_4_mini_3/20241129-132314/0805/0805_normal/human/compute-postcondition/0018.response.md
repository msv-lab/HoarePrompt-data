The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are known: `index` is a valid index in the `letters` and `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 26. The value of `added_index` depends on the specific values of `index` and `n`, but since we do not know the exact values, we can only express the relationship. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index found in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index found in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
