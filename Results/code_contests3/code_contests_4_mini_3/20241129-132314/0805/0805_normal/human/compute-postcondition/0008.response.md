To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. `s` is the first character of `strings`.
2. `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, which is an assumed string of uppercase English letters (A-Z).
3. `added_index` is calculated by adding `n` to `index`.
4. `new_index` is determined by taking the modulo of `added_index` with 26.
5. `new_s` is then assigned the character from `letters` at the position `new_index`.

Since `letters` is typically "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", we can infer the positions of its characters.

The final output state will include:
- `s` as the first character of `strings`
- `index` as the position of `s` in `letters`
- `added_index` as `index + n`
- `new_index` as `added_index % 26`
- `new_s` as the character from `letters` at `new_index`

Putting this all together, the output state will reflect these values. Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `new_strings` is an empty string; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is equal to `index + n`; `new_index` is equal to `added_index % 26; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at `new_index`.**
