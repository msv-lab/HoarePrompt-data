To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

From the initial state, we have:
- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq N \leq 26 \).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `strings` is a non-empty string.
- `index` is the index found in `letters`.
- `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`.
- `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`.

The code snippet assigns `new_s` the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `letters` is presumably a string of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z' (though it's not explicitly stated in the initial conditions).

The impact of the code:
1. `added_index` is calculated using the `index` and the input integer `n`.
2. `new_index` is then determined by taking `added_index` modulo 26.
3. Finally, `new_s` is assigned the value at the `new_index` position in `letters`.

Since we don't have specific values for `index`, `n`, or `letters`, we can describe the output state in general terms based on the calculations made.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_s` is assigned based on the calculations of `new_index`, but we cannot specify the exact character it will hold without knowing the specific values of `index`, `n`, and `letters`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index found in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26; `new_s` is assigned letters[new_index].**
