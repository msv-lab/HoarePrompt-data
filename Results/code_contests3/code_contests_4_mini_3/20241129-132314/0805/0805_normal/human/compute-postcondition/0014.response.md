To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state of the variables:

- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `strings` is a non-empty string.
- `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is equal to `index + n`.
- `new_index` is equal to `(index + n) % 26`.

The code snippet assigns the value of `letters[new_index]` to `new_s`. 

1. `new_index` has already been computed as `(index + n) % 26`.
2. The value of `new_s` is determined by accessing the `letters` string at the position `new_index`.

Since `letters` is assumed to be a string consisting of the uppercase English letters (A-Z), `letters` would typically be "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".

Therefore, the output state will reflect the computed values:

- The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged.
- `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters` at the position `new_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is equal to index + n; `new_index` is equal to (index + n) % 26; `new_s` is letters[new_index].**
