The value of `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`. The `new_index` is then assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `index` and `n` will determine the resultant `new_index`, but since the specific values of `index` and `n` are not provided, we describe the relationship instead. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string; `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is equal to index + n; `new_index` is equal to (index + n) % 26.
