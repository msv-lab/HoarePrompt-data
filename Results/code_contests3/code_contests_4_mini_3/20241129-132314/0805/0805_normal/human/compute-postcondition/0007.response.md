The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is known (it is `index + n`), but since `index` and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `new_index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, and `new_index` is equal to `added_index % 26`.
