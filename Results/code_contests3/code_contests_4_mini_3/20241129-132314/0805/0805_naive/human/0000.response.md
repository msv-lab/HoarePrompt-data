Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character of the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order, wrapping around from `Z` back to `A` as specified in the problem description. 

Here's how it works:
- The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from the input.
- It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters for reference.
- For each character `s` in `S`, it finds the index of `s` in `letters`, adds `N` to this index, and then takes this sum modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around correctly.
- It constructs the new string by appending the character at the new index to `new_strings`.
- Finally, it prints the resulting shifted string.

The program handles all edge cases:
- A shift of `0` results in the original string, which is correctly implemented.
- The wrap-around from `Z` to `A` is handled correctly with the modulo operation.
- The constraints specified (0 ≤ N ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^4) are respected by the input handling and logic.

Since I could not find any potential case where the program does not follow the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
