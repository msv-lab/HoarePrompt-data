To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic of the code against the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program must calculate the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses exactly N city blocks, with N being an integer in the range 1 to 1,000,000. The output should be the minimum possible perimeter that can be achieved.

### Analyzing the Program:
```python
n = int(input())
x = int(n ** 0.5)
if x ** 2 == n:
    answr = x * 4
elif x * (x + 1) > n:
    answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
else:
    answr = 4 * (x + 1)
answr = int(answr)
print(answr)
```

1. **Calculate `x`:** The variable `x` is determined as the integer square root of `n`. This variable represents the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Check if `n` is a perfect square:** 
   - If `x ** 2 == n`: This checks if the area can be represented as a perfect square (e.g., for `n = 4`, the perimeter is `8`).
   
3. **Calculate perimeter for non-square areas:**
   - In the second condition `elif x * (x + 1) > n`: This condition checks if the area cannot fit in the perfect rectangle of `x` by `x+1`. If this is true, the perimeter is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
   - The final condition handles the case where the area can fit in a rectangle of `x + 1` by `x + 1`, and the perimeter is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Check the case for N = 1:**
   - Expected perimeter: 4 (since it's a 1x1 square).
   - The program will compute `x = 1`, recognize `1 ** 2 == 1`, and return `4`. This is correct.

2. **Check the case for N = 2:**
   - Expected perimeter: 6 (since it's a 1x2 rectangle).
   - The program will compute `x = 1`, and since `1 * 2 = 2` is not greater than `2`, it falls to the last case, returning `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is incorrect.

3. **Check the case for N = 3:**
   - Expected perimeter: 8 (since a 1x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 8).
   - The program will compute `x = 1`, and since `1 * 2 = 2` is not greater than `3`, it falls to the last case, returning `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is correct.

4. **Check the case for N = 5:**
   - Expected perimeter: 12 (since a 1x5 rectangle has a perimeter of 12).
   - The program will compute `x = 2`, and since `2 * 3 = 6 > 5`, it falls into the second condition and returns `(2 + 2 + 1) * 2 = 10`. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to return the correct perimeter for several cases, such as `N = 2` and `N = 5`. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
