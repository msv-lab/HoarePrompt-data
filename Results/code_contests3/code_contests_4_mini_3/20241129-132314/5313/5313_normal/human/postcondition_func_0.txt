The function accepts a positive integer `n` (input by the user) and calculates a value `answr` based on the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1) > n`, it returns `4 * x + 2`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. Finally, it prints the computed value `answr`. The function does not return any value, and its output is directly printed.
