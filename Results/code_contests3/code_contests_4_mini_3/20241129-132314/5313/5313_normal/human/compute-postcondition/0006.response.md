The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The variable `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`, and since `x` is not a perfect square, we know that `x * (x + 1) > n`. However, we do not have a specific value for `x` provided in the initial state, only that it is a positive integer. The expression `(x + x + 1) * 2` simplifies to `2x + 1 * 2`, which is `4x + 2`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `answr` based on the value of `x`, which we know is greater than `0`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, which is not a perfect square; and `answr` is `4x + 2`.**
