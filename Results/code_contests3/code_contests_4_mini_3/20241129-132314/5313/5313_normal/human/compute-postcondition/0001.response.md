The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the square root of `n` and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is given as an input integer, and since `N` is a positive integer and `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6`, `n` will also fall within this range. The specific value of `x` depends on the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.**
