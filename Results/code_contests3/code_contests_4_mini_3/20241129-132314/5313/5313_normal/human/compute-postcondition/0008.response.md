To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state and the effects of the code.

Given:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. This implies \( x = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) \).
- The value of `n` is not a perfect square, and it holds that \( x \cdot (x + 1) \leq n \).

The code snippet:
```
answr = 4 * (x + 1)
```

The impact of this code snippet is that it calculates `answr` by multiplying 4 with \( (x + 1) \).

1. The previous value of `x` is determined from the equation \( x = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) \). Given that \( n \) is not a perfect square, \( x \) must be less than the actual square root of \( n \).
2. Thus, the calculation for `answr` will yield a specific integer value based on the computed value of `x`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `n`, we can represent `x` as \( \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) \).

The output state will therefore reflect the computed answer in terms of `x`:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).**
