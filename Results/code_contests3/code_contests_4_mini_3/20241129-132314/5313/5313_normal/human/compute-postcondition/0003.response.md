Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` with the condition that the square of `x` equals `n`, we can deduce the following:

1. Since `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` and the square of `x` is equal to `n`, it follows that `n` is a perfect square, specifically `n = x^2`.
2. The code `answr = x * 4` assigns the value of `x * 4` to `answr`.

Thus, the value of `answr` will be `4` times the integer square root of `n`, which is `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is a perfect square; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4`.**
