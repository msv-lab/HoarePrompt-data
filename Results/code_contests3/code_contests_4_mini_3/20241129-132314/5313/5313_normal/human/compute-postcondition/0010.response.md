Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; if `n` is a perfect square, then `answr` is equal to `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square and if `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is `4x + 2`; otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.***
