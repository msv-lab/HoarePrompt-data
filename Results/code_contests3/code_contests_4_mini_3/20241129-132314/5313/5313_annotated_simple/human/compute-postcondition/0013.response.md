The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a positive integer `N`, which is constrained to the range of 1 to 1,000,000. The function's output is not explicitly described in the provided information, therefore we cannot determine the return value based solely on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a positive integer N within the range of 1 to 1,000,000, but the return value is unspecified.**
