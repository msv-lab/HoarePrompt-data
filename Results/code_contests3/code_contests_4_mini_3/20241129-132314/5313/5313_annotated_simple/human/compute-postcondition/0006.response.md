The variable `answr` is assigned the value of the expression `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and since `n` is not a perfect square, we can analyze the calculation. The expression simplifies to `2x + 1`, and then multiplying it by 2 yields `4x + 2`. 

However, the exact value of `x` is not provided, so we can't determine a specific numerical result for `answr`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `4x + 2`.
