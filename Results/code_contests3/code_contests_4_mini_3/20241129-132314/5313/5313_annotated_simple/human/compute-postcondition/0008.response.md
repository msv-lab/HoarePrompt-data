In the given code, `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The variable `x` is defined as the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is not a perfect square, `x` will be the largest integer such that `x * x < n`. Additionally, it is given that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`, which implies that `x + 1` is the next integer after `x`, and multiplying it by 4 will yield a value based on `x`.

Since `N` is a positive integer satisfying the range, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is defined by the square root of `n`, we can compute `answr`.

The overall impact of the code is to compute the value of `answr` based on `x`. The final value of `answr` will depend on the value of `x`, which is derived from `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**.
