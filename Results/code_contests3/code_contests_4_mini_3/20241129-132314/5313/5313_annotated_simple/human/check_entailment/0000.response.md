To verify the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the annotated program.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program takes a single integer `N` as input, representing the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.
2. The output should be the minimum perimeter that can be achieved for a shape that encloses exactly `N` blocks.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program first computes the integer square root `x` of `N`.
2. It checks if `N` is a perfect square:
   - If `N` is a perfect square (`x ** 2 == n`), it computes the perimeter as `x * 4`.
3. If `N` is not a perfect square, it further checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`:
   - If true, it sets the perimeter to `(x + x + 1) * 2` (which simplifies to `4x + 2`).
   - If false, it sets the perimeter to `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Perimeter Calculation:
- The perimeter for a square shape enclosing `N` blocks is indeed `4 * sqrt(N)` when `N` is a perfect square.
- For non-square values of `N`, the perimeter is calculated based on finding the closest rectangular arrangement (where one side could be `x` and the other could be `N/x`).
- The conditions check whether to increase the perimeter based on the arrangement possibilities.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
1. **Perfect Square Case**: The program correctly returns the perimeter for perfect squares by the formula `4 * sqrt(N)`.
2. **Non-Perfect Square Case**: The perimeter is calculated correctly based on the conditions to ensure that the minimum perimeter is always chosen for rectangular arrangements. 

### Conclusion:
The program effectively calculates the minimum perimeter for any given `N` as required by the problem description. It handles both perfect squares and non-perfect squares appropriately, ensuring the output meets the requirements of enclosing exactly `N` blocks with the minimum perimeter.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
