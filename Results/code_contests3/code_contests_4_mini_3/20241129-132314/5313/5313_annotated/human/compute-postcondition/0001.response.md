`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the square root of `n` and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^6. Therefore, `x` will be a non-negative integer representing the integer part of the square root of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.**
