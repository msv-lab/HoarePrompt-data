To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided initial conditions and the code snippet. 

1. The variable `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`, which is less than the square root of `n` because it is specified that `x` squared does not equal `n`. Therefore, `x` is a positive integer.
2. The code snippet calculates `answr` as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. This simplifies to `(2x + 1) * 2`.

Now, we can express the output state based on the calculations:

- The value of `answr` will be `4x + 2`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical value of `answr`, but we can represent it in terms of `x`.

Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`.**
