The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6. Since there are no specified output conditions or cases given in the output, the functionality of the function cannot be determined. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns based solely on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
