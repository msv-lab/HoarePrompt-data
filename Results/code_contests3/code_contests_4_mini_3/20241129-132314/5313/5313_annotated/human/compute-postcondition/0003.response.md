The value of `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` and `x` squared is equal to `n`, we can calculate `answr` based on the value of `x`. Since `n` is an input integer with the property that it is a perfect square, we can determine that `answr` will be `x * 4`. 

As `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`, we know that:

- `n = x^2` (since `x` squared equals `n`),
- Therefore, `answr = x * 4`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between `n`, `x`, and `answr`, but since the specific values for `n` and `x` are not provided, we express the results in terms of `x` and `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4.**
