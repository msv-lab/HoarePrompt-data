Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) from the user and calculates a value based on the integer part of the square root of `n`, denoted as `x`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, it returns `2 * (2 * x + 1)`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not return a value but outputs the result directly to the console. **
