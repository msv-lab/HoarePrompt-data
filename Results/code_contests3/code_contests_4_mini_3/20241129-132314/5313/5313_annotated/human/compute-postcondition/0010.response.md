Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, then `answr` is equal to `x * 4`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is `4x + 2`. If `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, then `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`.***
