You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly N city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly N blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.

Input

Input will consist of a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.

Output

Print the minimum perimeter that can be achieved.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = int(n ** 0.5)
    if (x ** 2 == n) :
        answr = x * 4
    else :
        if (x * (x + 1) > n) :
            answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
        else :
            answr = 4 * (x + 1)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is `4x + 2`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, then `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x
    answr = int(answr)
    print(answr)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) from the user and calculates a value based on the integer part of the square root of `n`, denoted as `x`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, it returns `2 * (2 * x + 1)`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not return a value but outputs the result directly to the console.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
