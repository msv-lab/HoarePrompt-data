Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum perimeter for the given area `N`. The main issues are as follows:

1. **Handling Non-Square Areas**: The logic applied for calculating the perimeter when `n` is not a perfect square is flawed. The condition `if (x * (x + 1) > n)` is not guaranteed to correctly account for all possible configurations of blocks that can form the given area. This condition aims to determine if the area can be formed with dimensions `x` and `x + 1`, but it does not cover all configurations or shapes that could yield the minimum perimeter.

2. **Minimum Perimeter Calculation**: The minimum perimeter for a given area is generally achieved by a rectangle that is as close to a square as possible. However, the program does not systematically find the best integer dimensions (length and width) that yield the required area `N` while minimizing the perimeter. It only checks a specific condition which may not always yield the correct result.

3. **Example Cases**: For the example of N = 11, the correct minimum perimeter is 14, which can be achieved with a rectangle of dimensions 3x4 (or 4x3). The provided logic does not explore this possibility adequately and could lead to incorrect results in various cases.

To summarize, the program does not guarantee the correct minimum perimeter for all integer values of `N` from 1 to 10^6, thus failing to meet the requirements of the problem description.
