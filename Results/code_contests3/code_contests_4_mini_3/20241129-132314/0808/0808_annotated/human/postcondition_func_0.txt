The function reads multiple datasets consisting of positive integers \( n \) (with \( 1 \leq n \leq 999,999 \)) from standard input and counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each \( n \). It prints the count for each input. The function does not handle cases where the input may be invalid (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-bounds integers), and it assumes that the input will always be valid and within the specified range.
