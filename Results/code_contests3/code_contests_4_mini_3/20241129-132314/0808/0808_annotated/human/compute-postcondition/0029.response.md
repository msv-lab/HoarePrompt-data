The loop iteratively checks each number starting from 2 up to 999,999. For each prime number found (where `a[i - 1]` is `True`), it marks all multiples of that prime number as `False` in the list `a`. 

After all iterations of the loop are complete, the list `a` will contain `True` at indices corresponding to prime numbers and `False` at indices corresponding to non-prime numbers. The final state of the list will reflect the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which identifies all prime numbers up to 1,000,000.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, where `True` represents prime indices and `False` represents non-prime indices.**
