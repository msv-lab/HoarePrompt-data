According to the code, the loop executes as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the starting value for `j` is:
```
i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
```

Since `j` is 3 at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `j` for the next iteration will be:
```
j = j + i = 3 + 2 = 5
```

For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` will be 5, which is much less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with `a[3]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
