The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`. The previous value of `a[5]` is not specified but can be assumed to be `True` since it is part of a list initialized with `True` values. Thus, after execution, `a[5]` is now `False`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, and `a[3]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[3]` set to `False` and `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[3]` set to `False` and `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
