According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `j` is 11. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is \(3^2 - 1 = 8\), and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration.

The next value of `j` after the current value of 11 will be \(j + i = 11 + 3 = 14\). Since 14 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[11]` set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 14 for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
