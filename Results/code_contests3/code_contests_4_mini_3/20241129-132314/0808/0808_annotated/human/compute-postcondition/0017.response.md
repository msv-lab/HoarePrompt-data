In this case, `a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The current value of `j` is 14, so `a[14]` will be set to `False`. The initial state of `a` has `a[11]` already set to `False`, but the assignment to `a[14]` does not affect other indices. The other variables, `i` and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[11]` is False, `a[14]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 14.

Output State: **`a[11]` is False, `a[14]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
