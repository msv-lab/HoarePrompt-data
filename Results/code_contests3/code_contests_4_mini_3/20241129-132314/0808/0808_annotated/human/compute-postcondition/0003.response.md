According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the calculated range for `j`. The starting value for `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `1000000`, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is `2`) on each iteration. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that the starting value of `j` (which is `3`) is less than `1000000`. This condition is satisfied. 

Since `i` is `2`, the first value of `j` will be `3`, and it will continue to increment by `2` on each iteration. The values of `j` will be `3, 5, 7, 9, ...` up to `999999`, and since `j` starts at `3`, the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the first time**
