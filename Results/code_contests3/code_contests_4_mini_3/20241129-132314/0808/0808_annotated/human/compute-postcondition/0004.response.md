The value of `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, all set to `True`. The code sets the value at index `j` (which is 3) of the list `a` to `False`. Therefore, after execution, the value at index 3 changes from `True` to `False`, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. The variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, with `a[3]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3**
