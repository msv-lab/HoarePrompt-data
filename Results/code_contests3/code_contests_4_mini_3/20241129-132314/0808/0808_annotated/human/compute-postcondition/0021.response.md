To determine the state needed for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement. The `for` loop iterates over a range defined by `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`, with a step of `i`. 

Currently, it is given that `i` is at 1,000,000, which means the range becomes:

- Start: `i ** 2 - 1 = 1000000 ** 2 - 1 = 999999999999`
- End: `1000000`
- Step: `1000000`

Since the starting point (999999999999) is greater than the ending point (1000000), this means that the loop will not execute at all under the current state.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust `i` so that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than or equal to `1000000`. The simplest way to achieve this is to set `i` to a value such that `i ** 2 - 1` is less than or equal to `1000000`. 

For example, if we set `i` to 32, then:

- Start: `32 ** 2 - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023`
- End: `1000000`
- Step: `32`

This configuration allows the loop to execute, since 1023 is less than 1000000.

Therefore, the necessary states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, `i` is 32, for the loop to execute the first time `j` starts at 1023**
