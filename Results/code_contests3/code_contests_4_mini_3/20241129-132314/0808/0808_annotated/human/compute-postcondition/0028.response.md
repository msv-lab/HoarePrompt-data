Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `i` is 32 and `j` is the last value calculated in the loop (which is less than 1,000,000), with all indices `j` starting from `i`. If `a[i - 1]` is False, the else part does not apply since there is no else block.***
