According to the code, the loop execution depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The current value of `j` is 8, and `i` is 3. The loop will calculate the next value of `j` using the expression `j + i`, which will be 8 + 3 = 11. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to 11, which is still less than 1,000,000. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, `i` is 3, `j` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
