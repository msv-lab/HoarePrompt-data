According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` and the range defined for `j`. The expression `i ** 2 - 1` calculates the starting point of `j`. Since `i` is 3, we have:

- \( i^2 - 1 = 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8 \)

The loop starts at 8 and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches 1,000,000.

Given that `j` starts at 8, and will take values 8, 11, 14, ..., up to but not including 1,000,000, the loop will execute as long as `j` remains within the bounds of the range.

Thus, to ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that:

1. The starting value of `j` (which is 8) is valid and within the range.
2. The loop will continue to execute until `j` becomes equal to or exceeds 1,000,000.

Since the initial conditions are already set for `i` and `j`, they do not need further adjustments for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, `i` is 3, `j` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time**
