The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it reads multiple datasets consisting of positive integers. Each integer `n` is constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 999,999\), and there are no more than 30 datasets. After processing the datasets, the function will return output based on the provided integers. However, since the specific return value is not detailed in the output provided, we can only describe the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple datasets consisting of positive integers n, where each n is constrained to be between 1 and 999,999, and there are no more than 30 datasets.**
