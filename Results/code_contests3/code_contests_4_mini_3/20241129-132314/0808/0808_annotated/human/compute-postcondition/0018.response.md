The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`) and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) until `j` reaches 1,000,000. The loop sets `a[j]` to `False` for each value of `j`. 

After all iterations of the loop execute, `j` will take values starting from 8 and incrementing by 3 each time. The loop continues until `j` equals or exceeds 1,000,000.

The last value of `j` before exceeding 1,000,000 can be calculated as follows:
- The last value of `j` is the largest number less than 1,000,000 that can be expressed as `8 + 3*n` for some integer `n`.
- This means we need to find the largest `n` such that `8 + 3*n < 1,000,000`.
- Rearranging gives `3*n < 999,992` or `n < 333,330.67`. Thus, the largest integer `n` is 333,330.
- Therefore, the last value of `j` is `8 + 3 * 333,330 = 999,998`.

At the end of the loop, all values of `a[j]` where `j` is a multiple of `3` starting from `8` up to `999,998` will be set to `False`. This means that `a` will have `False` values at indices `8, 11, 14, ..., 999,998`, which represents one-third of the list as `a` contains `1,000,000` elements.

Since `i` remains unchanged throughout the loop, its final state will still be `3`, and `j` will be `999,998` after the last iteration.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[j]` set to `False` for all `j` from `8` to `999,998` (inclusive) where `j` is a multiple of `3`, `i` is 3, `j` is 999,998.**
