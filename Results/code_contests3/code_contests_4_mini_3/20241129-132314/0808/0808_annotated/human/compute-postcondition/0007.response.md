According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 5. The next value of `j` will be calculated using the formula `j += i`, which means `j` will be increased by 2.

To determine whether the loop will execute again, we calculate the next value of `j`:

- Current `j` is 5. 
- The next `j` will be `5 + 2 = 7`.

Now, we check if `j` is still less than 1,000,000. Since 7 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[3]` set to `False` and `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 7 for the loop to execute a third time.**
