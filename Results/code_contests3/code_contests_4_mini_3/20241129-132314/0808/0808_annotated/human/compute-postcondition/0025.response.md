According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is \(32^2 - 1 = 1023\), and increments `j` by `i` (which is 32) in each iteration until it reaches 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1055, and for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than 1,000,000. The next value of `j` will be calculated as \(j + i = 1055 + 32 = 1087\).

Since 1087 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values with `a[1055]` set to False, `i` is 32, `j` is 1087, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
