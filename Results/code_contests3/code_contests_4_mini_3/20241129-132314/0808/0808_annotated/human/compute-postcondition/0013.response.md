The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`. Initially, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, and since the specific values are not provided, we cannot determine the previous value at `a[j]`. However, we know that `i` is 3 and `j` is 8, so the operation affects `a[8]`. The states of the other variables are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, `i` is 3, `j` is 8; `a[8]` is set to False.**
