According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 32, and `j` is 1023. The loop starts from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `32 ** 2 - 1 = 1023` and increments `j` by `i` (32) each time it executes.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to calculate the next value of `j`. The current value of `j` is 1023. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 32, resulting in `j = 1023 + 32 = 1055`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` (now 1055) must still be less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 boolean values, `i` is 32, `j` is 1055; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
