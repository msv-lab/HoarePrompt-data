According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `j` and `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 14. 

The starting point for `j` in the next iteration would be calculated as follows:
- The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration.
- Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + i = 14 + 3 = 17`.

Now, we need to check if this new value of `j` (which is 17) is still less than 1,000,000:
- Since 17 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be updated to 17.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17 for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
