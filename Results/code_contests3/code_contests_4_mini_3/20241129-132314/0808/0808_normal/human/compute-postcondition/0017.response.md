`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 17. Therefore, `a[17]` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables (`a`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is `False`, `a[17]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17**
