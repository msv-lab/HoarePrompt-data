Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 (except for index 2 itself) are `False`. If `i` is 2 and `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the loop continues and `j` is the last index processed by the loop that is less than 1,000,000. If `a[i - 1]` is `False`, the loop will not execute further.***
