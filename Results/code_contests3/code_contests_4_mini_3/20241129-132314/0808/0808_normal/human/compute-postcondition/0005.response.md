According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i` each time, as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is 3. 

First, we calculate the starting point for `j` in the next iteration:

- The current value of `j` is 3.
- The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `3 + 2 = 5`.

Next, we need to check if `j` (which will be 5) is still less than 1,000,000 to determine if the loop can execute again. Since 5 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute once more.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `j` should be updated to 5. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
