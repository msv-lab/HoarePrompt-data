To analyze the loop, we see that it starts with `j` initialized to `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop then iterates by increasing `j` by `i` (which is 3) each time, marking certain indices of the list `a` as `False`.

Given the initial state where `a[2]` is `True`, we can summarize the effects of the loop:

- In the first iteration, `j` starts at `8`, so `a[8]` is set to `False`.
- In the second iteration, `j` becomes `11`, and `a[11]` is set to `False`.
- In the third iteration, `j` becomes `14`, and `a[14]` is set to `False`.
- In the fourth iteration, `j` becomes `17`, and `a[17]` is set to `False`.

The loop continues until `j` reaches or exceeds `1,000,000`, marking indices `a[j]` as `False` for every iteration.

After all iterations of the loop, the variable `j` will be the last value calculated before exiting the loop, and `a` will have several indices set to `False`, while `a[2]` will remain `True`.

To summarize the final output state:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[8]`, `a[11]`, `a[14]`, `a[17]`, and all subsequent indices marked by the pattern `8 + 3k` for `k` being a non-negative integer are `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is the last calculated value before exiting the loop (greater than 1,000,000).**
