Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, if `a[2]` is `True`, then `a[8]`, `a[11]`, `a[14]`, `a[17]`, and all subsequent indices marked by the pattern `8 + 3k` for `k` being a non-negative integer are `False`, `i` is 3, and `j` is the last calculated value before exiting the loop (greater than 1,000,000).***
