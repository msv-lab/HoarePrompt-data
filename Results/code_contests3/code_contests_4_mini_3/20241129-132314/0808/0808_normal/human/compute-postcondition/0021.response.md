According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute a fourth time when `i` is 4, we need to consider the starting point of the loop defined by `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals `16 - 1 = 15`. The loop continues until `j` reaches 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 4) in each iteration.

To execute a fourth time, `j` must take on the values of 15, 19, 23, and 27 during its iterations. Thus, the loop will successfully execute four times if `j` starts at 15 and increments by 4 each iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 4, `j` is 15 for the loop to execute the fourth time**
