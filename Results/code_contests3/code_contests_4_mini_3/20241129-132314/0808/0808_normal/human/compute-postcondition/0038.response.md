Functionality: ** The function reads multiple datasets of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) from standard input, processes them to identify prime numbers up to 1,000,000, and prints the count of prime numbers for each dataset. It does not accept any parameters and does not handle cases where the input integer is less than 1 or greater than 999,999, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
