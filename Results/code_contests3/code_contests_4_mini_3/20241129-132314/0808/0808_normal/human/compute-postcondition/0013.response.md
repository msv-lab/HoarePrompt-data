The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 11. Since `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements and the assignment specifically changes the value at index 11, the previous value of `a[11]` is not specified, but it will now be `False`. The other variables `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
