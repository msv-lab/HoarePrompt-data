The code assigns `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. The previous value of `a[7]` is not specified, but it is being set to `False`. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `a[7]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `a[7]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
