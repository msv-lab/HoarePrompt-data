According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by the for loop. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 15, and the loop's range is defined from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 15) to 1,000,000 with a step of `i` (which is 4). 

To determine the next value of `j`, we need to add `i` (4) to the current value of `j` (15). Thus, the next value of `j` will be 19. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 4, `j` is 19; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
