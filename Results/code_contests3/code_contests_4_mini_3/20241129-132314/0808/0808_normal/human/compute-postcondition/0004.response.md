`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 3. Since `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all initially set to `True`, the element at index 3 is changed to `False`. The values of `i` and the other elements of `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
