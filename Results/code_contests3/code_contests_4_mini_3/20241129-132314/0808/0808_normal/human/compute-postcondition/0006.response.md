`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is 5, so `a[5]` is set to `False`. This operation affects only the element at index 5 in the list `a`, while the other elements remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
