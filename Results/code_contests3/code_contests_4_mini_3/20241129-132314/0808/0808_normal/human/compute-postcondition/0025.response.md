According to the code, the loop executes based on the range defined by `j` and the values of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, which means the value of `i ** 2 - 1` is 15. The range for `j` is then `range(15, 1000000, 4)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 19. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 19, the next value of `j` in the range will be 19 + 4 = 23.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to 23.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True` and `a[19]` is now `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 23**
