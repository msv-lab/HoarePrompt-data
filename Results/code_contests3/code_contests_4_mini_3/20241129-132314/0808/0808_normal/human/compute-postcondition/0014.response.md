According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the upper limit of the range. The for loop initializes `j` to `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1` or `8`, and continues while `j` is less than `1000000`, incrementing `j` by `i` which is `3` in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `11`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `3`, so `j` will become `14`. Since `14` is still less than `1000000`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
