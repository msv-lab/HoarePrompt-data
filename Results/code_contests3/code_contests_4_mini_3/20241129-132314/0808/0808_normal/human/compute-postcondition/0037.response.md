The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it reads multiple datasets directly. Each dataset contains an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`, and there can be a maximum of 30 datasets in total. After processing the datasets, the function returns results based on the values of `n` from those datasets. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read multiple datasets containing integers within the specified range and process them accordingly without accepting any parameters directly. 

Functionality: **The function reads multiple datasets containing integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) with a maximum of 30 datasets in total and processes these datasets without accepting any parameters.**
