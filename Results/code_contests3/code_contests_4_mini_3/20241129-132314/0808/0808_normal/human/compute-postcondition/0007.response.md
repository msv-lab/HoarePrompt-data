According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The expression `i ** 2 - 1` calculates the starting point of the loop. Given that `i` is 2, `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1`, which is `3`. Therefore, the loop starts at `j = 3` and increments `j` by `i`, which is `2`, at each iteration until `j` reaches `1000000`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by `i`, resulting in `j` becoming `7`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `1000000`. 

The current state indicates that `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, and since `j` is now `7`, it is still less than 1,000,000. Thus, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
