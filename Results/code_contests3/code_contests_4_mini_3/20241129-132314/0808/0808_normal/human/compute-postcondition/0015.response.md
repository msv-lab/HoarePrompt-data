The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Since `j` is 14, the element `a[14]` is set to `False`. The previous value of `a[14]` is not stated, but the other variables `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a[14]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
