The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`. Given that `j` is 19, the element `a[19]` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True` and `a[19]` is now `False`; `i` is 4; `j` is 19.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[2]` is `True` and `a[19]` is now `False`; `i` is 4; `j` is 19**
