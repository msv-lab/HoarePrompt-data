To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop code and the initial conditions.

The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is \(3^2 - 1 = 8\)) and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches 1,000,000. In each iteration, the value at index `j` in the list `a` is set to `False`.

Since `i` is 3, we calculate the values of `j` for each iteration of the loop:
- The first value of `j` is 8 (indexing starts from 0, so the 9th element is set to `False`).
- The subsequent values of `j` will be 11, 14, 17, 20, ..., until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

The maximum value of `j` would be calculated as follows:
- The last value of `j` before it exceeds 1,000,000 can be determined by starting from 8 and adding 3 successively until reaching the limit.
- The maximum value of `j` would be \( j = 8 + 3k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer and \( j < 1,000,000 \).

To find the maximum \( k \):
- Set \( 8 + 3k < 1,000,000 \)
- This implies \( 3k < 999,992 \) or \( k < 333,330.67 \)
- The largest integer \( k \) is 333,330.

Consequently, the loop will run 333,330 times, changing the values at indices:
- 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ..., up to the largest index satisfying the condition.

After all iterations of the loop have finished executing:
- The values at indices 8, 11, 14, ..., 999,998 will all be set to `False`.

The final output state will thus reflect these changes in the list `a`, while `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value, the 9th value, and all values at indices 8 + 3k (for k = 0 to 333,330) are `False`, `i` is 3.**
