To determine the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information.

1. The loop iterates over `j` in the range `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`, with a step of `i`.
2. The current state shows that `i` is 3, and `j` is 14 at the end of the previous iteration.
3. The calculation for the range is:
   - The starting point is `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.
   - The loop will continue until `j` is less than `1000000`, increasing by `i` (which is 3) each time.

Now, we need to find out the next value of `j`:

- The last value of `j` before the next iteration of the loop is 14. The next value of `j` will be `14 + 3 = 17`.

Now let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- The list `a` remains the same.
- `j` will be updated to 17.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `1000000`. Since `17 < 1000000`, the loop can execute once more.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000.**
