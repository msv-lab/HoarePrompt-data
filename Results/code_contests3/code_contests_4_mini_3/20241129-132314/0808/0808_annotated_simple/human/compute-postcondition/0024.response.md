`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 23. The previous value of `a[23]` is `True`, so after execution, `a[23]` becomes `False`. The other values in the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with index 19 set to `False`, `a[23]` set to `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 23.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with index 19 set to `False`, `a[23]` set to `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 23**
