According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i`. The loop is expected to execute starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and will continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` each time. 

Given that `i` is currently 3, we can calculate the starting point for `j`:
- `i ** 2 - 1` = `3 ** 2 - 1` = `9 - 1` = `8`.

For the loop to execute a third time, we need to determine the value of `j` during the iterations:
1. **First iteration**: `j` = 8 (initial value)
2. **Second iteration**: `j` = 8 + 3 = 11
3. **Third iteration**: `j` = 11 + 3 = 14

For `j` to be valid for the third execution, it must still be less than 1,000,000, which it is. 

Therefore:
- The state of `a` does not affect the execution of the loop.
- The value of `i` is appropriate since it allows the loop to execute.
- `j` will start at 8 and increment by 3 each time; hence, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` will be 14.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, `i` is 3, `j` is 14 for the loop to execute the third time**
