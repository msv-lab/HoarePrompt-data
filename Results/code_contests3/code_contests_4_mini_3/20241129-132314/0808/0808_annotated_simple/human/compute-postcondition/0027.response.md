To analyze the loop's output state after it has executed all iterations, we observe the provided initial state and the loop code:

1. The list `a` initially contains 1,000,000 `True` values.
2. The loop modifies entries of the list `a` starting from index `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 15 for `i = 4`) and continues to set every `i`-th index to `False` until it reaches the end of the list (1,000,000).

From the output states given after the first three iterations, we can deduce that:
- After the first iteration, index 19 is set to `False`.
- After the second iteration, index 23 is also set to `False`.
- After the third iteration, index 27 is set to `False`.

The pattern here is that the loop starts at index 19 and sets every 4th index (because `i` is 4) to `False`. The indices affected will be:
- 19 (for j = 19)
- 23 (for j = 23)
- 27 (for j = 27)
- 31 (for j = 31)
- ...
- Continuing this way until the last index that can be set to `False` before reaching 1,000,000.

To find the last index set to `False`, we calculate the largest value of `j` that is less than 1,000,000:
- The last value of `j` can be calculated as follows: 
    - Starting from 19 and moving in steps of 4, we can express `j` as `19 + 4k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer.
    - Setting `19 + 4k < 1,000,000`, we find the maximum `k`:
    - `4k < 999,981` which gives `k < 249,995.25`, so the maximum integer value for `k` is 249,995.
- This gives us the last index affected by the loop: 
    - `j = 19 + 4 * 249,995 = 999,999`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
- All entries starting from index 19 to index 999,999 with a step of 4 are set to `False`.
- The total number of indices set to `False` can be calculated, which is `(999,999 - 19) / 4 + 1 = 249,996`.

Finally, the output state can be summarized as:
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where indices 19, 23, 27, ..., 999,999 are set to `False`, and all other indices remain `True`.
- `i` is still 4.
- The last value of `j` after the loop finishes will be 999,999.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with indices 19, 23, 27, ..., 999,999 set to `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 999,999.**
