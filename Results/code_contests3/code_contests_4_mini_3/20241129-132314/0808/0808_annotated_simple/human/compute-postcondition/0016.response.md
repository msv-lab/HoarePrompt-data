According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` on each iteration until it reaches 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 17.

Calculating the starting point for the next iteration:
- The starting point is `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`.
- The current value of `j` is 17, which is less than 1,000,000.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by `i` (which is 3). Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `17 + 3 = 20`.

Since `j` is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False` and the 17th value is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 20**
