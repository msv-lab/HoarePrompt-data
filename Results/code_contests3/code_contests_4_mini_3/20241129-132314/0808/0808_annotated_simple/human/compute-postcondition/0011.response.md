According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. The loop updates the list `a` by setting all multiples of `i` greater than or equal to 4 to `False`. Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 3, and the loop will check the condition to see if `i` is less than 1,000,000. This implies that the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than 1,000,000.**
