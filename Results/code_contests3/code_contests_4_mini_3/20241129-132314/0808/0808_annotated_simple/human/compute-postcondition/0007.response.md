According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`, and increments by `i` (which is 2) until it reaches 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 5. The next value for `j` would be calculated as `j + i`, which in this case would be `5 + 2 = 7`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 5, the next value (7) is still less than 1,000,000, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7; for the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
