`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 3. In the initial state, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, so after execution, `a[3]` changes from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
