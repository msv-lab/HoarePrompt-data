According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `i`. Specifically, the starting point of the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000 and will increment by `i` (which is 2) on each iteration.

Initially, `i` is 2, so the first value of `j` will be 3. The loop will execute because 3 is less than 1,000,000. 

Therefore, the relevant states to ensure the loop executes correctly are:
- `i` remains 2.
- `j` starts at 3 for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the first time**
