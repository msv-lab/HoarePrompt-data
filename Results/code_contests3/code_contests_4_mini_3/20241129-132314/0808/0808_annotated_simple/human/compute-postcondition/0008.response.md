The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`. Since `j` is currently 7, `a[7]` is changed to `False`. The previous value of `a[7]` is unknown, but it will now be `False`. The states of the other variables (`a`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False` and `a[7]` is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False` and `a[7]` is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
