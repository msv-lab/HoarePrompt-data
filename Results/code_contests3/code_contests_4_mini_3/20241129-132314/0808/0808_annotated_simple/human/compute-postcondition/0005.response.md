According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. The starting point of the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) each iteration. 

Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased to 5 in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` (now 5) is still less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[3]` as `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5 for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
