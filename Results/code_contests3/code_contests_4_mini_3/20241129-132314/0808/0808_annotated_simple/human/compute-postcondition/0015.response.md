The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`, where `j` is 17. Therefore, the 17th value in the list `a` is changed to `False`. Other variables remain unaffected. The output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False` and the 17th value is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False` and the 17th value is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17**.
