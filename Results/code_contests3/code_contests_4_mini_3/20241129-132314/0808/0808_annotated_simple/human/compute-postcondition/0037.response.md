The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it processes multiple datasets, each containing a single integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`, and there can be at most 30 datasets. The function does not return a specific output based on these parameters in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe a specific return value without additional context on the output generated from these datasets. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers within the range of 1 to 999,999, but does not return any specific output based on the provided information.**
