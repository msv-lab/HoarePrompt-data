`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 14, the 15th element of the list `a` (which is currently `True`) is changed to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**.
