The value at index `j` of the list `a`, which is currently `True`, is assigned the value `False`. This operation changes the specific value at that index in the list while not affecting the other values in the list or the values of `i` and `j`. Therefore, after execution, the state of the affected variables is as follows: `a[j]` is now `False`, `i` remains 4, and `j` remains 19.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with index 19 set to `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 19**.
