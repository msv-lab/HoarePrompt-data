Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, where the 15th value, the 9th value, and all values at indices 8 + 3k (for k = 0 to 333,330) are `False`. If `i` is 3, and `a[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `a[2]`) is `True`, the condition holds, otherwise, there is no else part to execute.***
