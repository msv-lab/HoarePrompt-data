The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`. The previous value of `a[20]` is not specified, but since the assignment is made, it will now be `False`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where the 15th value is `False`, the 17th value is `False`, and now the 20th value is `False`; `i` is 3, `j` is 20.
