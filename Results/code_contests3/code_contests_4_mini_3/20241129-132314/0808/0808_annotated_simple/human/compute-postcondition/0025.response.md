According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `j` is 23. The next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which will be `23 + 4 = 27`. 

Since `27` is less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with index 19 set to `False`, `a[23]` set to `False`, `i` is 4, `j` is 27**
