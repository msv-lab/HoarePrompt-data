The function processes multiple datasets of integers, each representing a value `n` within the range of 1 to 999,999. It generates a list indicating whether each integer up to 1,000,000 is prime and then outputs the count of prime numbers for each input value `n`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the counts directly to the standard output for each dataset processed.
