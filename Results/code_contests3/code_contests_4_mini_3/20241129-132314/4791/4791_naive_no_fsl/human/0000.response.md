Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to set levels for the passages between rooms in such a way that the conditions stated in the problem description are satisfied. Specifically, the problem requires that for each room, if one leaves the room and returns by passing through passages of equal levels, the total number of passages traversed must be even. 

However, the code attempts to generate passage levels based on the binary representation of numbers, which does not guarantee that the levels assigned will always yield an even number of traversals for every room.

For example, if `N = 3`, the expected output must be a symmetric matrix representing the levels of the passages between each pair of rooms. Instead, the program may produce an output that does not adhere to the required conditions. 

A specific case where the program fails is when `N = 3`. The expected output should be something like:
```
1 2
1
```
This output ensures that all rooms can return to themselves through even traversal. However, the program's logic does not guarantee this arrangement and it can produce incorrect levels. 

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description for every potential case, leading to its correctness being marked as **False**.
