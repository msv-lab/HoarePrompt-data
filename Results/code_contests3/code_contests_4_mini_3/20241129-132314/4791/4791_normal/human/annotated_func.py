#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, and `j` is equal to -1. The output results are the positions of the first '1' in the binary representations of integers from 1 to the initial value of `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and expects to read an integer input `n` (though the input handling is incorrect since `input()` returns a string). It reduces the value of `n` in a loop until it reaches 0. For each value from 1 to the initial value of `n`, it calculates and prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of integers from 1 to `n`. However, since the function does not handle the input correctly, it will raise an error when attempting to subtract 1 from a string, making its functionality incomplete and erroneous.
