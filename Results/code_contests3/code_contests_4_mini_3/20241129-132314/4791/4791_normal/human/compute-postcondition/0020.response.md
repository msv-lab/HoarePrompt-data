The value of `n` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `n` is at least 1. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be at least 0. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` still equal to `n - 1`. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, and `j` is either 0 or -1 depending on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, `j` is either 0 or -1**
