According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; the output of the print statement will be 2.**
