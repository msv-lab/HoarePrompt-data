According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, the conditions allow the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2, as `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
