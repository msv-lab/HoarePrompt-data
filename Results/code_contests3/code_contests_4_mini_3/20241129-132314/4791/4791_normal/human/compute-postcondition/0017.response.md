To analyze the given code snippet step by step:

1. The variable `j` is given the value 2.
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. The binary representation of `3` is `0b11`.
4. The `bin(j + 1)` function will return the string `'0b11'`.
5. The `[::-1]` slice operation reverses this string, resulting in `'11b0'`.
6. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'11b0'`, which is at index `0`.
7. The result of `find('1')` is `0`, and adding `1` gives us `1`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be `1`, but it does not affect the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is `1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is `1`**.
