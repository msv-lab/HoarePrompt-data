The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes a user input as a string. The previous state of `N` remains unchanged, and `n` is now a string representation of the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input string**
