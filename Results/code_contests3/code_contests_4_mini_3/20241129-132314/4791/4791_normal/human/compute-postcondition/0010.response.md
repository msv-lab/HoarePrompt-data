According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as `n` is a non-empty string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer of at least 2. Therefore, `n` must not be modified for the loop to execute one more time, as it is already in a state that allows this. 

The variable `j` is defined as `n-1`, but since `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, this does not directly impact the loop's ability to execute again. 

Thus, no other states need to be adjusted, and we can simply repeat the program state as it is.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer of at least 2, `j` is `n-1`**
