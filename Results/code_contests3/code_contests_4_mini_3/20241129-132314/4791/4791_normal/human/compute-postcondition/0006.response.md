The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` takes the value of `j`, which is currently 1, increments it by 1 (resulting in 2), converts this value to its binary representation (which is `'10'`), reverses the string (resulting in `'01'`), and then finds the index of the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string. The index of the first `'1'` is 1 (considering 0-based indexing), and then 1 is added to it, resulting in the final output of 2.

The values of other variables (`N`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer of at least 2, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.**
