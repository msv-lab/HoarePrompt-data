Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and expects to read an integer input `n` (though the input handling is incorrect since `input()` returns a string). It reduces the value of `n` in a loop until it reaches 0. For each value from 1 to the initial value of `n`, it calculates and prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of integers from 1 to `n`. However, since the function does not handle the input correctly, it will raise an error when attempting to subtract 1 from a string, making its functionality incomplete and erroneous. **
