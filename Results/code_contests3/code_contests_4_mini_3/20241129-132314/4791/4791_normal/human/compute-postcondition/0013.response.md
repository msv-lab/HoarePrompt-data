The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated. 

1. The variable `j` is 0, so `j + 1` equals 1.
2. The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`, and when we slice it using `bin(j + 1)[::-1]`, it becomes `'1b0'`.
3. We then search for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed binary string, which is found at index `0`.
4. Finally, we add `1` to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

The state of other variables (`N` and `n`) is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is `1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is `1`.**
