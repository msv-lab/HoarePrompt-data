According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which means it is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop can execute again without needing any adjustments to the state.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
