To analyze the provided code snippet, we have the following initial state:

- `N` is an integer between 2 and 500
- `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 2
- `j` is 2

Now, let's break down the code:

1. We calculate `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1` = `3`.
2. Next, we convert `3` to its binary representation using `bin(3)`, which gives us the string `'0b11'`.
3. We then reverse this string (excluding the `'0b'` part), resulting in `'11'`.
4. We use the `.find('1')` method to find the index of the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'11'`, which is `0`.
5. Finally, we add `1` to this index, resulting in `0 + 1` = `1`.

Now we combine the results with the values of the other affected variables. The values of `N` and `n` do not change in this operation.

Therefore, the output state will summarize these findings:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
