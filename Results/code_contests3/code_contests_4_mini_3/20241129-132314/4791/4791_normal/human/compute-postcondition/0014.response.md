According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, meaning the loop has executed once and will execute again if `j` is incremented. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increase to 1. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute a second time.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
