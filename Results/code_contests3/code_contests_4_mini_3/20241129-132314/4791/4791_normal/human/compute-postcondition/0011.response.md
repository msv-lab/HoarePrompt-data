`n` is decremented by 1, so if `n` is a string representing an integer of at least 2, its integer value will be reduced by 1. The variable `j`, which is defined as `n-1`, will also be affected since it is based on the original value of `n`. After the decrement, `n` will now represent the integer value of `n` minus 1, and `j` will be updated accordingly to represent the new value of `n` minus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer value of at least 1; `j` is `n-2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer value of at least 1; `j` is `n-2`**
