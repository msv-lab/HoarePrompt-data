`n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a non-empty string, which when interpreted in the context indicates it will be converted to an integer. Therefore, `n` will be reduced by 1. The output state reflects the change in `n`, while `N` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a non-empty string decremented by 1**
