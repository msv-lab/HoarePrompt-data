In the given code, we have `j` which is initially 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`, and when we slice it with `[::-1]`, it remains `1`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index results in 1.

The other variables, `N` and `n`, are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
