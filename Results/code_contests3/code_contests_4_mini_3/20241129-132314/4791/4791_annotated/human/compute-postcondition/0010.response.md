According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (truthy), the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, which means it is currently a positive integer. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the output of the print statement includes the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to `n`.**
