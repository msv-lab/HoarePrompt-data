According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is greater than 1, it can execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
