The value of `j` is 1. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. Reversing this string gives `01`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 1. Adding 1 to this index results in 2. Therefore, the output of the print statement is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2**.
