According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
