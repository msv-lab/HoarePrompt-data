To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we analyze the loop and its implications based on the given initial state and output states from the iterations.

The loop iterates `n` times (where `n` is the initial value before the loop begins, specifically `n - 1` is the initial value of `j`). In each iteration, the loop prints the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, which corresponds to the position of the first '1' from the right.

Given that:
- The output of the print statement for `j = 0` is 1.
- The output for `j = 1` is 2.
- The output for `j = 2` is 1.

The outputs follow a pattern based on the binary representations:
- For `j = 0` (binary `1`), the output is 1.
- For `j = 1` (binary `10`), the output is 2.
- For `j = 2` (binary `11`), the output is 1.

Continuing this pattern, we can deduce that:
- For `j = 3` (binary `100`), the output would be 3.
- For `j = 4` (binary `101`), the output would be 1.
- This pattern continues where the output corresponds to the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of each successive number.

After `n` iterations:
- `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500.
- `n` decreases to 0 after all iterations.
- `j` will be `n - 1`, which after all iterations will be `n - n = -1`.

Since the loop will always execute `n` times (for `n` positive), the output states will contain the sequence of outputs for all values from `0` to `n-1`.

Thus, the final state reflects that:
- `n` is now 0.
- `j` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the output consists of the positions of the least significant '1' bits for values from 1 to the initial value of `n`.**
