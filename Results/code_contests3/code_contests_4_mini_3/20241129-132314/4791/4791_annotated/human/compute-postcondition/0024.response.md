The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` after reversing that representation. Given that `j` is 1, we calculate `j + 1`, which is 2. The binary representation of 2 is `'10'`. Reversing this gives `'01'`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at position 1 (0-indexed). We then add 1 to this index to convert it to a 1-indexed position, resulting in 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2**.
