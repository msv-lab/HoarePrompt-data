To execute the code snippet, we first analyze the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`.

1. **Calculate `j + 1`:** 
   - Since `j` is 2, this becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.

2. **Convert to binary:** 
   - The binary representation of 3 is `0b11`, which as a string is `'0b11'`. 

3. **Reverse the string:**
   - Reversing `'0b11'` gives `'11b0'`.

4. **Find the index of '1':**
   - The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'11b0'`, which is at index 0.

5. **Adding 1:** 
   - Adding 1 to the index gives `0 + 1 = 1`.

The output of the print statement will be `1`, and the values of `N`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the output is 1.**
