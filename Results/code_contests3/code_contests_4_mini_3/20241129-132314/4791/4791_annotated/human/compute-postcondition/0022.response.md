In the given code, `j` is currently 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, and when we slice it with `[::-1]`, we get `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` function looks for the first occurrence of `'1'` in this reversed binary string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1. The `print` function will output this value.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is now 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is now 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
