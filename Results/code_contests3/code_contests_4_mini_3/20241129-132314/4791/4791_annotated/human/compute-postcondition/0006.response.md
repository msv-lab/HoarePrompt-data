`j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. When reversed, it becomes '01'. The `find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 1 (0-based indexing). Adding 1 to this index results in 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.**
