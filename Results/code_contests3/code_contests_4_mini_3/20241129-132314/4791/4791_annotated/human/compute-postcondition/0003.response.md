According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since it has been stated that `n` has been decremented by 1, we need to ensure that `n` is now at least 1. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0 before the loop starts. At the beginning of the loop, `j` will start from 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
