The code prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for the integer `j + 1`. The value of `j` is currently 0, so `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`. When reversed, it remains `1`, and the position of the first '1' is found at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us the position as 1. The output of the print statement will thus be 1. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1**.
