According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the output of the print statement includes the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to `n`.**
