To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop code and the initial state provided.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`. During each iteration, it prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for the integer `j + 1`. This is done by converting `j + 1` to binary, reversing it, and finding the index of the first '1' bit, then adding 1 to that index (to convert it to a 1-based position).

Given that the initial state indicates `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, and `j` starts at -1 (or `n - 2` if `n` is greater than 1), we note:

- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains -1. 
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes `n` times.

Let's analyze the cases for `n` greater than 0. The positions printed will correspond to the least significant '1' bits of the integers from 1 to `n`:

1. For `j = 0` (which corresponds to the integer 1), the output is 1.
2. For `j = 1` (which corresponds to the integer 2), the output is 2.
3. For `j = 2` (which corresponds to the integer 3), the output is 1.
4. For `j = 3` (which corresponds to the integer 4), the output is 1.
5. Continuing this way, the outputs for all integers up to `n` will be generated.

After all iterations, `j` will be `n - 1` (the last index reached in the loop). The printed outputs will be the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to `n`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:

- `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is equal to `n - 1` (the last value of `j` after loop completion).
- The output of the print statement will have printed the least significant '1' bit positions for each integer from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the output of the print statement includes the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to `n`.**
