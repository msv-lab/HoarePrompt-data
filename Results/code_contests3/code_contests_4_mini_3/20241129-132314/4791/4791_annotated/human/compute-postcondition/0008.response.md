The value of `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 3, and `bin(3)` yields the binary representation `'0b11'`. Reversing this string results in `'11b0'`, and the `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 to this gives a final result of 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
