The value of `n` is decremented by 1, meaning that `n` will now be less than its previous value. Since `n` was greater than 0, it will still remain greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement. The values of `N` and `j` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 (but now reduced by 1), `j` is `n - 1` (which will also change accordingly).

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 (now less by 1), `j` is `n - 1`**
