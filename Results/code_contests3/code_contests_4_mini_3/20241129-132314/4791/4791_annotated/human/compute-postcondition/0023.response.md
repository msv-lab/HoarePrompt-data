According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
