The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle an integer `N`, which is constrained to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Based on this constraint, the function's implementation will lead to different outputs depending on the value of `N`. However, since no specific output cases were provided in the prompt, the exact return values cannot be detailed.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is intended to return values based on the internal handling of an integer N, constrained to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
