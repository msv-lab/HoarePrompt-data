In the code snippet, `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. The `bin(3)` function converts the integer `3` to its binary representation, which is `'0b11'`. The `[::-1]` slice reverses the string, yielding `'11b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is at index `0`. Adding `1` gives us a final result of `1`.

Since the code executes a print statement, it does not change the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`, but it does output a value. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the returned value from the print statement.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2; printed value is 1**
