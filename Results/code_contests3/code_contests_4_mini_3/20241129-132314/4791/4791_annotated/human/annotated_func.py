#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the output consists of the positions of the least significant '1' bits for values from 1 to the initial value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and reads an integer `n` from user input. It then decrements `n` down to 0 and, for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`, it prints the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The output consists of the positions of the least significant '1' bits for values from 1 to the initial value of `n`. However, the input handling does not enforce that `n` is between 2 and 500, which is a noted precondition. If `n` is less than 1, the function will not output any values.
