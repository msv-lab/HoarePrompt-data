#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The output is a 2D representation of levels for passages between rooms, where each passage level is a positive integer.
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the printed output consists of the positions of the least significant '1' bits for values from 1 to the original value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input `N` (expected to be between 2 and 500 inclusive), and generates a sequence of integers representing the positions of the least significant '1' bits for values from 1 to `N`. However, it lacks input validation and does not produce a structured 2D output as implied by the annotations.
