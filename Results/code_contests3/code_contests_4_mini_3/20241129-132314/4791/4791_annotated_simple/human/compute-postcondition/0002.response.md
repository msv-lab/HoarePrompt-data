`n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a non-empty string, which implies it can be converted to an integer value. `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, so the output state will reflect the change in `n`, but we don't know the exact value of `n` prior to the operation. So, `n` is decreased by 1. The values of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a non-empty string decreased by 1**
