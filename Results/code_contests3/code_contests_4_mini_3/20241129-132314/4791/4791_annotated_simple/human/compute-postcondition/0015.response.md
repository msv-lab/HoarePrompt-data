`j` is 1, so we first calculate `j + 1`, which is 2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`. When we reverse this string, we get `01`. The `find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 1. Adding 1 to this index gives us 2. Therefore, the printed value is 2. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2.**
