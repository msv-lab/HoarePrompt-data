The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, the new value of `n` will be positive. The variable `j` remains unchanged, still equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 (now decremented by 1), `j` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 (now decremented by 1), `j` is `n - 1**
