To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop. The loop continues as long as `n` is non-empty, which means `n` must be a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `N` is an integer between 2 and 500.
- `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 0.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- The result of the print statement is `1` printed `n` times, which suggests that `n` is still a valid non-empty string representing a positive integer.

Since `n` is currently a non-empty string that represents an integer greater than 0, the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any states.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`**
