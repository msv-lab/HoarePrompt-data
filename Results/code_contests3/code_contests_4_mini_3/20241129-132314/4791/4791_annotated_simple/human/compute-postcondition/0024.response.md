The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses it, finds the index of the first occurrence of '1', and adds 1 to that index. The initial state indicates `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. When reversed, it becomes '01'. The first occurrence of '1' is at index 1. Adding 1 gives us a result of 2.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `n`) are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
