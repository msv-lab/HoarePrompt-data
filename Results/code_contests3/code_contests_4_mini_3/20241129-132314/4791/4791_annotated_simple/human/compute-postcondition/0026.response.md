The expression `bin(j + 1)` converts `j + 1` to its binary representation. Given that `j` is 2, `j + 1` equals 3, and its binary representation is `0b11`. The slicing `[::-1]` reverses this string to `11b0`, and then the `find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Finally, adding 1 gives us 1. Thus, the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1**.
