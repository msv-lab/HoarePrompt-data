The value of `n` is decremented by 1, and since `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 0, it can be converted to an integer to perform the operation. The previous value of `n` is an integer greater than 0, thus `j` (which is initially `n - 1`) will also be affected by this change. 

After executing `n -= 1`, the new value of `n` will be `n-1`, and consequently, `j` will also update to reflect the new value of `n-1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0; `j` is `n - 1` (where `n` is now the decremented value).

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0; `j` is `n - 1`**
