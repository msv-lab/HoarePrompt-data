The code involves the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

1. First, we calculate `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 2, we have:
   - `j + 1` = 2 + 1 = 3.

2. Next, we convert this result to its binary representation:
   - `bin(3)` gives us the string `'0b11'`.

3. We then reverse this string:
   - `'0b11'[::-1]` results in `'11b0'`.

4. Now, we search for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string:
   - `'11b0'.find('1')` returns the index `0`, since the first '1' is at the 0th position.

5. Finally, we add 1 to this index:
   - `0 + 1` = 1.

The printed value will therefore be `1`.

Given that no other variables are affected, the output remains unchanged except for the printed value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 1.**
