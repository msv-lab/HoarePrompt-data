According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as `range(n)` generates a sequence starting from 0 up to `n-1`. Given that `j` is initialized as `n - 1`, it will take values from `0` to `n-1` during the loop iterations. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `j` is derived from `n`, it is implied that `j` will be updated during the loop iterations starting from 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 before the loop starts.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
