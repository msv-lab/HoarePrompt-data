According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is stated to be greater than 0, the loop can execute. The loop will iterate `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, we have `n` (which is greater than 0 after being decremented), and `j` is calculated as `n - 1`. This means that at the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
