`j` is 2, so we calculate `j + 1`, which is 3. The binary representation of 3 is `0b11`. When we reverse this string (excluding the `0b` prefix), we get `11`. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0. Adding 1 to this result gives us 1. The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
