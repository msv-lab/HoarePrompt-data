The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that string, and adds 1 to the index found. Given that `j` is initially `0`, `j + 1` equals `1`. The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`, and reversing the string after removing the prefix gives us `'1'`. The `find` method returns `0` (the index of '1'), and adding `1` results in `1`.

Since the values of `N`, `n`, and `j` do not change, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1.**
