According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
