Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The task is to generate the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but the function `func_1` seems to be checking if a given string is a palindrome, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. 

For instance, if we input `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the program does not produce this output at all. It does not even handle the input as intended, since it is designed to work with strings and check for palindromic properties rather than generating even-length palindromes. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for generating even-length palindromes, making it incorrect.
