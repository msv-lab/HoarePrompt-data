The given problem description asks for a function that outputs the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. Even-length palindromes are numbers that read the same forwards and backwards and have an even number of digits.

The provided program, however, does not follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input `n`, which it processes as a string to check if it is a palindrome. It extracts alphabetic characters, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is the same forwards and backwards. This is not related to generating even-length palindromes or finding the n-th one as specified in the problem description.

Furthermore, the output hints state that the function is designed to check for palindromes in strings, which is entirely different from generating even-length palindromes based on an integer input. The hints incorrectly suggest that `n` is a string, while the problem describes `n` as a positive integer.

The following edge cases further illustrate that the code does not meet the problem requirements:
1. The function will not handle large integer values as specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000) since it does not generate palindrome numbers at all.
2. The function does not return any even-length palindrome numbers, which is the core requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for any scenario.

Correctness: **False**.
