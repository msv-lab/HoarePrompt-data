Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, extracts all alphabetic characters from it, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). It returns True if the processed string is a palindrome and False otherwise. The annotations incorrectly suggest that `n` is a positive integer, which is misleading; `n` is expected to be a string. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` contains no alphabetic characters, which would result in returning True for an empty string. **
