The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10000000} \). After executing the function body, it returns True, as the output indicates that an empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return True, as demonstrated by the example involving the empty string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns True.**
