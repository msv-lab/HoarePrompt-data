The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000000} \). After executing the function body, it returns `True` because the empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` based on the comparison of the empty string with its reverse.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns True.**
