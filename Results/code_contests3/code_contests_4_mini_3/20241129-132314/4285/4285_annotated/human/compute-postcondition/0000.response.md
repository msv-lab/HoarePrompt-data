The code takes the variable `n`, which is a positive integer, and attempts to filter out the alphabetical characters from it. However, since `n` is specified to be a positive integer, there are no alphabetical characters present in `n`. As a result, the list comprehension will result in an empty list. The `join` method will then concatenate the elements of this empty list into an empty string. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, and since `x` is not defined prior to this code snippet, it will be assigned an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000; `x` is an empty string**
