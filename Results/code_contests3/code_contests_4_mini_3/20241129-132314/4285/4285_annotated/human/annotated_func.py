#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True because the empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `n`, converts all alphabetic characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). The function returns True if the string is a palindrome or empty; otherwise, it returns False.
