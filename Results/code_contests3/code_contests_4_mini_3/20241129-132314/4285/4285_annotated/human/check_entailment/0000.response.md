Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function that computes the n-th even-length palindrome number, taking a positive integer `n` as input. However, the annotated program defines a function that checks if a string is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and comparing the resulting string with its reverse.

Here are the key points highlighting the discrepancies:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that the input is a single integer `n`, while the function `func_1` is designed to accept a string and processes it in a manner suitable for checking palindromes, not generating even-length palindromes.

2. **Output Requirement**: The problem requires the output to be the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the program is set to return a boolean value indicating whether the input string is a palindrome.

3. **Palindrome Generation**: The program does not include any logic to generate or return even-length palindrome numbers, such as 11, 1001, etc. It simply checks for palindromic properties of a string, which is irrelevant to the task at hand.

Consequently, the program fails to fulfill the requirements of generating and returning the n-th even-length palindrome number as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is incorrect.
