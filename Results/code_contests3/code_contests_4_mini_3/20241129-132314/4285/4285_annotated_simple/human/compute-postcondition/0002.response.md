The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000. The function constructs a string `x` by joining the lowercase alphabetic characters from `n` and returns whether this string `x` is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return whether the string formed from its lowercase alphabetic characters is a palindrome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns whether the string formed by joining the lowercase alphabetic characters from n is a palindrome.**
