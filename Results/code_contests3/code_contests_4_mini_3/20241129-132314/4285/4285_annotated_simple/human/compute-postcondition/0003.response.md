Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, extracts all lowercase alphabetic characters from its string representation, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. Note that since `n` is treated as a string, if `n` contains no alphabetic characters, the function will return `True` as the empty string is considered a palindrome. **
