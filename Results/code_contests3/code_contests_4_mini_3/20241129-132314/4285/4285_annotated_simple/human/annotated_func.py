#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns whether the string x, formed by joining the lowercase alphabetic characters from n, is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, extracts all lowercase alphabetic characters from its string representation, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. Note that since `n` is treated as a string, if `n` contains no alphabetic characters, the function will return `True` as the empty string is considered a palindrome.
