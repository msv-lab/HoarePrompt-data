Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a program that outputs the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, whereas the given program checks whether a string (derived from the input `n` by filtering for alphabetic characters and converting them to lowercase) is a palindrome.

Here are the specific reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept a string and does not appropriately handle the numeric input specified in the problem. The input `n` should be treated as a large integer (up to 10^1000000), but the program processes it as a string and filters for alphabetic characters.

2. **Output Requirement**: The expected output is the n-th even-length palindrome number. However, the program does not generate or return any palindrome numbers. Instead, it only checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome, which is irrelevant to the task at hand.

3. **Even-length Palindrome Generation**: The program lacks the logic to generate even-length palindromes, which is central to the problem. It does not account for the sequence of even-length palindromes, such as 11, 22, 33, ..., 1001, etc.

In summary, the program does not implement any of the required functionality to determine or output the n-th even-length palindrome number, thus it does not meet the expectations set by the problem description.
