You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Pari has a friend who loves palindrome numbers. A palindrome number is a number that reads the same forward or backward. For example 12321, 100001 and 1 are palindrome numbers, while 112 and 1021 are not.

Pari is trying to love them too, but only very special and gifted people can understand the beauty behind palindrome numbers. Pari loves integers with even length (i.e. the numbers with even number of digits), so she tries to see a lot of big palindrome numbers with even length (like a 2-digit 11 or 6-digit 122221), so maybe she could see something in them.

Now Pari asks you to write a program that gets a huge integer n from the input and tells what is the n-th even-length positive palindrome number?

Input

The only line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10100 000).

Output

Print the n-th even-length palindrome number.

Examples

Input

1


Output

11


Input

10


Output

1001

Note

The first 10 even-length palindrome numbers are 11, 22, 33, ... , 88, 99 and 1001.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns whether the string x, formed by joining the lowercase alphabetic characters from n, is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
