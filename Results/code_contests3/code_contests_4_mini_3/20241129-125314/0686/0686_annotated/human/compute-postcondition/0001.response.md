The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers with values ranging from 1 to 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers with values ranging from 1 to 100. 

Since there is no output specified in the provided information, we cannot detail the specific return values or behavior of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and operates under the constraints that n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12), and a and b are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). The return value is not specified.**
