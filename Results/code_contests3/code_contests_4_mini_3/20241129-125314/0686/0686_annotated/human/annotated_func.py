#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and currently contains no implementation. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values. The annotations suggest constraints on the parameters n, m, a, and b, but since the function does not utilize them or define any parameters, it effectively does nothing.
