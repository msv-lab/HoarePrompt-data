The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained by the relationship 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers constrained by the relationship 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` under the defined constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m as positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12), and parameters a and b as integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100).**
