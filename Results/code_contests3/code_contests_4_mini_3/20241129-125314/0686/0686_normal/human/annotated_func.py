#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not contain any operational code and hence does not perform any actions or return any values. It is supposed to accept parameters `n` and `m` as positive integers, and `a` and `b` as integers, but since the function body is empty, it has no defined functionality.
