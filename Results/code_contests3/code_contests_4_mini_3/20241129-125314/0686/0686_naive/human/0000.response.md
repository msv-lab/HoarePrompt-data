Correctness: **False**. 

The program is empty (`{}`), meaning it lacks any implementation to solve the problem described. Therefore, it cannot compute the minimal amount of burles needed to ensure the number of commentary boxes is divisible by the number of delegations. 

For example, if we input the case `n=9`, `m=7`, `a=3`, `b=8`, the program should output `15` as per the problem statement, but since the program does not contain any logic, it cannot provide this output. This is a clear violation of the requirements in the problem description.
