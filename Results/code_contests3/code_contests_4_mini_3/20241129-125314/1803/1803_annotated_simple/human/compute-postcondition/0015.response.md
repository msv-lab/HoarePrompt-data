Functionality: ** The function accepts an input string formatted as '{letter1, letter2, ...}' and extracts characters at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., from the string. It then computes and prints the number of unique characters extracted from these indices. If the input string does not meet the expected format or length requirements, the function may not behave as intended, such as returning 0 for empty or invalid inputs. **
