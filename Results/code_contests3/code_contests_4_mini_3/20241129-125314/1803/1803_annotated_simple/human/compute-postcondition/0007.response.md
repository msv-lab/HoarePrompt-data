`Arreglo` is updated by appending the character at index `k` from the string `Cadena`. Since `k` is 4, the character `Cadena[4]` will be added to `Arreglo`. The previous value of `Arreglo` is its current state containing the second character of `Cadena`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', has a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', has a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
