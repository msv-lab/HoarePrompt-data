The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Initially, `k` is 7, so after execution, `k` becomes 10. The other variables `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', has a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 10.
