The variable `Arreglo` is assigned the previous value of `Arreglo` plus a new element, which is `Cadena[k]`. Given that `k` is 7, `Cadena[k]` is the character at index 7 of `Cadena`. The previous value of `Arreglo` consists of the second character of `Cadena` and the character at index 4 of `Cadena`. Therefore, `Arreglo` is expanded by appending the character located at index 7 of `Cadena`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', has a length greater than 4; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena` plus the character at index 7 of `Cadena`; `k` is 7.**
