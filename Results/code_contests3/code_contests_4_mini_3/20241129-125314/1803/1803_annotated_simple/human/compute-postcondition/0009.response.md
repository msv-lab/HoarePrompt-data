According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `len(Cadena)` and the comparison with `k`. The loop can execute again if `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 7, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4, which means `len(Cadena)` is currently greater than 2. However, we need to ensure that `len(Cadena)` is also greater than 7 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since we know that `len(Cadena)` is currently greater than 4, we need to adjust it to be greater than 7. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', has a length greater than 4 and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 7; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` plus the character at index 4 of `Cadena`; `k` is 7**
