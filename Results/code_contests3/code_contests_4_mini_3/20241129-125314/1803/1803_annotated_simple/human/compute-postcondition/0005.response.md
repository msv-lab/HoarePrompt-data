The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 1, after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and has a length greater than 2; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and has a length greater than 2; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
