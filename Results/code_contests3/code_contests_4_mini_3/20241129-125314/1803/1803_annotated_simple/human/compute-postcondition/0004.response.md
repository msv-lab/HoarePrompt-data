The code assigns the value `Cadena[k]` to `Arreglo` by concatenating it to the existing list `Arreglo`. The variable `k` is 1, so `Cadena[k]` refers to the second character of the input string `Cadena`. The initial state indicates that `Arreglo` is an empty list, thus after executing the code, `Arreglo` will contain the second character of `Cadena`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and has a length greater than 2; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`; `k` is 1**
