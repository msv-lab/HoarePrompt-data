The code takes the variable `Arreglo`, which contains specific characters from the string `Cadena` at the defined indices. It then converts `Arreglo` to a set to remove any duplicate characters and calculates the length of this set. 

Since `Arreglo` is derived from `Cadena`, and `Cadena` is a valid input string as described in the initial state, the output will reflect the number of unique characters that were captured in `Arreglo`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and has a length greater than 2; `Arreglo` contains characters at specified indices of `Cadena`; the length of unique characters in `Arreglo` is printed.**
