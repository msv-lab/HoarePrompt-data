To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the total number of distinct letters in a set represented as a string. The string starts with an opening curly bracket `{`, ends with a closing curly bracket `}`, and contains lowercase letters separated by a comma and a space.

### Program Analysis:
```python
Cadena = raw_input()
Arreglo = []
k = 1
while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
    Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
    k = k + 3
print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string input and assumes it follows the specified format.
2. **Extraction Logic**: The program attempts to extract every third character starting from the second character (index 1). This means it will only capture certain letters, specifically those that appear at positions 1, 4, 7, etc.
3. **Count of Unique Letters**: It converts the list `Arreglo` to a set to find unique letters and prints the length.

### Edge Cases:
- For an empty set represented as `{}`, the program will not enter the while loop (`k` starts at 1) and thus will return a count of 0. This is correct.
- If the set has repeated letters, such as `{a, b, a, c}`, the program might not correctly capture all distinct letters since it only checks every third character. Thus, it would only consider the letters at positions 1 (`a`), 4 (`c`), etc., ignoring the repetitions in between and potentially missing letters.

For example:
- Input `{a, b, c}` would yield a count of 1 (only capturing `a`).
- Input `{b, a, b, a}` would yield a count of 1 (only capturing `b`).
- Input `{a, b, c, d, e, f, g}` would yield a count of 2 (only capturing `a` and `d`).

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function extracts every third character starting from the second character and counts unique characters. This aligns with the implementation of the code but indicates a flaw in handling full input sets.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the prompt. Specifically, it fails to count distinct letters properly when they do not appear at the specified indices, leading to incorrect outputs in various scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly in cases where the letters are not positioned at the required indices, resulting in incorrect counts of distinct letters.
