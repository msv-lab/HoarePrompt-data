The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is not provided, but it is assumed to be a valid index within the range of `Cadena` (which has a length greater than 2). The state of `Arreglo` is also impacted, as it is updated to include `Cadena[k]` at the new value of `k`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]` at the new index, `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]` at the new index, `k` is increased by 3.**
