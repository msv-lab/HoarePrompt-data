The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes an input string that is a representation of a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with the letters separated by a comma and a space. The length of the string is guaranteed to be no greater than 1000 characters, and it is confirmed to start with an opening curly bracket and end with a closing curly bracket. The function outputs a value based on this string format.
