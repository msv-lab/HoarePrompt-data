Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input representing a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets, processes it to extract every third character starting from the second character (index 1), and prints the count of unique characters from this extracted set. If the input string is not properly formatted or does not contain enough characters, the output will depend on the characters present but will always result in a count of unique letters. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
