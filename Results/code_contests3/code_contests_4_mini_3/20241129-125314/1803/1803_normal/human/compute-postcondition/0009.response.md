According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `len(Cadena)` and `k`. The loop can execute again if both conditions `len(Cadena) > k` and `len(Cadena) > 2` are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been increased by 3, which means for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k + 3`. Since `k` is already increased by 3, we can say that `len(Cadena)` should be greater than the new value of `k`.

Thus, we need to adjust the condition to be `len(Cadena) > k + 3`, and since `len(Cadena)` also needs to be greater than 2, the current state also needs to ensure that `len(Cadena)` is greater than 2.

State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, k is increased by 3, and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k + 3` and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 2**
