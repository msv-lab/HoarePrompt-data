The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Parsing of Input**: The program extracts every third character starting from the second character of the input string. This means for an input like `{a, b, c}`, it would only extract `['a', 'c']`, leading to a wrong count of distinct letters. The correct approach would be to split the string on commas and spaces to get each letter.

2. **Handling of Empty Sets**: While the program does not explicitly handle the case of an empty set (`{}`), it would not function correctly since it relies on extracting characters based on specific indices. If the input is `{}`, it would not enter the while loop and would print `0`, which is correct, but this is more due to the way the loop condition is structured rather than proper handling of the input.

3. **Malfunction on Valid Inputs**: For inputs that contain letters, because the program is designed to pick every third character, it fails to count duplicates properly. For instance, an input of `{b, a, b, a}` would lead to an incorrect extraction, missing the necessary logic to handle duplicates correctly.

### Conclusion:
Due to these issues, the program does not accurately count the number of distinct letters as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
