The code appends the character at index `k` of `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`. Since `Arreglo` is a list containing the second character of `Cadena`, its previous state is known. The execution of this line will not change `Cadena`, but it will modify `Arreglo` by adding a new element.

Assuming `k` is within the valid range and `Cadena` has more than 4 characters (as per the loop condition), the output state reflects the updated contents of `Arreglo`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters; `Arreglo` now contains its second character plus the character at index `k`.**
