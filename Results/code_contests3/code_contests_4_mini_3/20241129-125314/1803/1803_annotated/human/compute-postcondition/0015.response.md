The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, where the letters are separated by commas followed by a space. The function collects every third character from this string starting from the second character (the first character after the opening curly bracket) and stores them in a list named `Arreglo`. After processing, it prints the count of unique characters in `Arreglo` by converting it to a set and calculating its length.

However, the function does not handle potential edge cases. For instance, if the input string does not follow the expected format (e.g., it lacks curly brackets or has fewer than two characters), the function could behave unexpectedly. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input formatted as a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, extracts every third character starting from the second character, and prints the count of unique characters from this extracted list. It does not return any value and does not handle malformed input properly. **
