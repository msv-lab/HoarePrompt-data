According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Cadena`. The loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. Right before the loop, `Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters. To ensure that the loop executes for the first time, the following conditions must hold:

1. `len(Cadena) > k`: Since `k` is 1, this means `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 1.
2. `len(Cadena) > 2`: This means `Cadena` must contain more than 2 characters.

For the loop to execute at least once, the string `Cadena` must contain at least 3 characters. 

Thus, if `Cadena` currently does not meet this condition, it needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, for the loop to execute the first time `Cadena` must contain at least 3 characters, `Arreglo` is an empty list, and `k` is 1**
