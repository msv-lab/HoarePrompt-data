The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `k`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters; `Arreglo` now contains its second character plus the character at index `k`, and `k` is increased by 3.
