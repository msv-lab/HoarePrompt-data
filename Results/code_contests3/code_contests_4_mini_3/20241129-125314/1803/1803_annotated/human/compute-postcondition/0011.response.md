The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` must be less than `len(Cadena) - 3` for the loop to execute again, it will now potentially be greater than or equal to that value depending on its previous state. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, `Arreglo` now contains its second character plus the character at index `k`, and `k` is increased by 3.
