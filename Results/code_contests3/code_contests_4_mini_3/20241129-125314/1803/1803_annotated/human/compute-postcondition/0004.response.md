The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo`, which is the result of concatenating the existing `Arreglo` with a list containing the character at index `k` of the string `Cadena`. Since `k` is 1, we look at the second character of `Cadena`. 

Assuming `Cadena` has at least 3 characters, `Cadena[k]` is valid, and `Arreglo` is initially an empty list. After execution, `Arreglo` will contain the second character of `Cadena` as its first element.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new status of `Arreglo` along with the existing values of `Cadena` and `k`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, `Arreglo` is a list containing the second character of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**.
