Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers, `T` and `X`, from standard input. The input constraints specify that both values will be within the range of 1 to 100, ensuring that there is never a case where `X` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error.

2. **Computation**: The function calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for `T` hours in World B using the formula `t / x`, which is equivalent to `T / X`. This matches the requirement of the problem description where `T` represents the study time in World B and `X` is the time dilation factor.

3. **Output**: The function prints the result of the division, which is the correct output as per the problem description. The output is in floating-point format, which aligns with the requirement to allow for a result with an absolute or relative error of at most \(10^{-3}\).

4. **Correctness of Results**: The division operation `t / x` directly corresponds to the described relationship between time spent in the two worlds. Given the constraints, this division will always yield a valid and meaningful result.

Since the program adheres to the problem description accurately and handles the input within the specified constraints, it is deemed correct.
