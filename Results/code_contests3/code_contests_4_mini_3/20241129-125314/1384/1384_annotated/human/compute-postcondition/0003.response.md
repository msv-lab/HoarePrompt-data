Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `t` and `x` (both within the range of 1 to 100) from user input, calculates the division of `t` by `x`, and prints the result. However, the function does not handle potential division by zero errors, which would occur if `x` were 0, even though the input constraints specify that `x` must be at least 1. Additionally, the function does not return any value. **
