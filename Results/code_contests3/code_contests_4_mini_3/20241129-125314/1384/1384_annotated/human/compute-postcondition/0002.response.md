The function `func` accepts two parameters: `T` and `X`. Both `T` and `X` are integers with the constraints that `1 <= T <= 100` and `1 <= X <= 100`. The function does not explicitly have a return value provided in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two integers `T` and `X` within the specified ranges, but it does not return a specific value or output based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters T and X, both integers within the range of 1 to 100, but does not return any specific value.**
