Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads two floating-point numbers from input, which are expected to be integers T and X within the range of 1 to 100. It then prints the result of dividing T by X. If X is 0, it would raise a ZeroDivisionError, as there is no handling for this case in the code.**
