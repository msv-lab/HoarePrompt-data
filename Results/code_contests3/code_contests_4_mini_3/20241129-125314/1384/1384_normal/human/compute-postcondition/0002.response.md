The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with two integer values, `T` and `X`, which are constrained such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq X \leq 100\). The function will perform certain operations based on these values and produce a return value, but the specifics of the output are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on the integers `T` and `X`, constrained within the specified ranges, although the exact return value or behavior is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates on the integers T and X, constrained such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.**
