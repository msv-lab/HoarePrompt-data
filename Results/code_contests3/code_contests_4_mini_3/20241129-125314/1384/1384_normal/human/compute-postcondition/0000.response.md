`t` and `x` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to floats. The initial state specifies that `T` is an integer and `X` is an integer within the range from 1 to 100. Since the input values can be any floats, the previous values of `t` and `x` are not directly known, but they will now represent the float values provided by the user. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float.**
