Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly handles the input values. It uses `map(float, input().split())`, which converts the inputs to floating-point numbers. However, the problem description specifies that the inputs are integers. While the mathematical operation of dividing two integers can yield a floating-point result, the problem states that the output must match the expected output format precisely, including error margins. 

If we input integers, for example, `8 3`, the expected output should be calculated as `8 / 3`, which is approximately `2.6666666667`. However, if we input `99 1`, the expected output should be `99.0000000000`, which is indeed correct in both integer and float context. 

However, a significant flaw arises when the inputs are very close to the limits of the constraints, or if they are large values. If an integer input is handled incorrectly (e.g., due to precision issues in floating-point arithmetic), it could lead to incorrect outputs. 

Additionally, the program does not account for proper formatting of the output to ensure it matches the expectation of at least 10^{-3} precision, which is required by the problem.

Thus, while the basic logic might yield correct results for some inputs, it fails to guarantee correctness for all inputs, especially considering edge cases and precision requirements. Therefore, the implementation is deemed incorrect.
