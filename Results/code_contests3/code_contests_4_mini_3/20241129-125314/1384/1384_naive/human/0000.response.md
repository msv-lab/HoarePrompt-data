Correctness: **True**.

The program takes two inputs, T and X, representing the hours Taro studies in World B and the speed factor X respectively. It calculates the equivalent hours that pass in World A using the formula `t / x`. This is correct because:

1. **Input Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints given (1 ≤ T ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ X ≤ 100). Since both T and X are integers, when converted to float for division, the calculations will still hold accurate.
  
2. **Output Format**: The program does not format the output to a specific number of decimal places, but since the problem states that the output is correct when its absolute or relative error is at most \(10^{-3}\), the division result will inherently meet that precision requirement, especially given that float division in Python is precise enough for the values involved.

3. **Examples**: The provided examples are correctly handled by the formula. For instance:
   - For input `8 3`, the output is `8 / 3 = 2.6666666666666665`, which is within the acceptable error range.
   - For input `99 1`, the output is `99 / 1 = 99.0`, which is also correct.
   - For input `1 100`, the output is `1 / 100 = 0.01`, which is accurate.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to convert hours studied in World B to hours passed in World A for all valid inputs, it is deemed correct.
