Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the problem, Taro studies for T hours in World B, where time passes X times faster than in World A. Thus, the amount of time that passes in World A while Taro studies in World B should be calculated as:

\[
\text{hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X}
\]

However, the implementation of the function incorrectly takes the input values `t` and `x` as floats, which is unnecessary since the problem constraints specify that they will be integers. Furthermore, the function does not correctly calculate the hours that pass based on the relationship between time in World A and World B. The correct calculation should consider the time dilation caused by the factor of X. 

The proper calculation for the output should be:

\[
\text{hours in World A} = T \times \frac{1}{X}
\]

The function currently divides `t` by `x`, which is not aligned with the requirement. Instead, it should be multiplying `T` by the inverse of `X` to find out how many hours pass in World A. Thus, the output is not guaranteed to meet the requirements of the problem, leading to possible incorrect results.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description correctly due to an incorrect formula used for the computation of hours in World A.
