The values of `T` and `X` are initially integers within the specified ranges. The code takes input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to floats, assigning them to `t` and `x`. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected by this operation, but `t` and `x` will now hold the float representations of the input values.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100; `X` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is the float value of the first input; `x` is the float value of the second input.**
