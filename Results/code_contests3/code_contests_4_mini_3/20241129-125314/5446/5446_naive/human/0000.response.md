To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it correctly calculates the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate contains at least \( x \) pieces of cake under the given constraints.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) representing:
   - \( n \): number of plates
   - \( a \): number of pieces of the first cake
   - \( b \): number of pieces of the second cake
2. **Output**: The maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake.
3. **Conditions**:
   - Each piece of cake must be placed on a plate.
   - Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
   - No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.

### Evaluation of the Code:
The code provided is:
```python
(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

#### Potential Issues:
1. **Variable Misassignment**: The code assigns `b` and `c` from the input, which appears to be incorrect. It should assign `a` to `b` and `b` to `c` for clarity and alignment with the problem statement.
   
2. **Logic for Maximum \( x \)**:
   - The expression `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not logically relate to how many pieces can be maximally placed on each plate. The number of pieces should be distributed based on the total pieces available and the number of plates.
   
3. **Integer Division**: The program does not use integer division, which may lead to incorrect calculations when finding how many pieces per plate can be maximized.

4. **Missing Condition Handling**: It does not check if \( n \) is greater than \( a + b \), which is a condition that makes it impossible to assign at least one piece to each plate.

### Test Cases:
- If we input `5 2 3`, the expected output is `1`. The program may return `1`, but the logic is flawed.
- If we input `3 2 2`, the program may give unexpected results as it does not correctly handle the division and the assignment.

Given the above considerations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement in all potential cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program contains logical errors and does not correctly implement the algorithm to solve the problem as per the specifications given.
