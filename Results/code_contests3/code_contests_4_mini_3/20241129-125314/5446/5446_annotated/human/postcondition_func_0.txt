The function accepts three integer inputs `n`, `b`, and `c` through user input. It calculates a ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`. It then computes the product of this ratio and the fraction of the minimum of `b` and `c` over `n`, and prints the ceiling of the resulting value converted to an integer. There is no check to enforce the precondition that `n` must be at least 2, nor that it must be less than or equal to `a + b`, as those parameters are not used within the function.
