To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variables `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
2. The variable `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`. This means that `x` holds the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`.
3. The expression `min(b, c) / float(n) * x` is then computed. This takes the minimum of `b` and `c`, divides it by `n`, and multiplies the result by `x`. 
4. The `ceil()` function is applied to the result of the previous calculation, which rounds it up to the nearest integer.
5. Finally, `int()` converts the result of `ceil()` into an integer, and this value is printed.

Since we do not have specific values for `n`, `b`, and `c`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **The printed value is int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * (max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)))))**
