The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, where `a` represents the number of pieces of the first cake (with a constraint of 1 ≤ a ≤ 100) and `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake (with a constraint of 1 ≤ b ≤ 100). Additionally, there is a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The function does not return any specific output in the provided context, so we cannot define any return values based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, ensuring that `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100), while also considering an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.**
