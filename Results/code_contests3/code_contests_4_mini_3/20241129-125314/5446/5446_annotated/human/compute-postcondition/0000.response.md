The code takes input in the form of three space-separated integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` will be directly taken from the input. The initial state implies that `n` is already an integer satisfying the condition (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), while `a` is defined but not changed by this code snippet.

Since the values of `a` and `c` are not altered by this line of code, the output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `b`, and `c` as integers obtained from the input, while `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `a` is unchanged**.
