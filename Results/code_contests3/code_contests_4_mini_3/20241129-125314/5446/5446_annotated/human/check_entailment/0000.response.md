Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Variables**: The function takes inputs `n`, `b`, and `c`, but the problem description specifies that the inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake. The program uses `b` and `c` instead of the correct variables.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The logic used for calculating `x` is flawed. The program computes `x` as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`, which is not aligned with the requirement of distributing cake pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The problem description dictates that we need to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate, not a ratio based on the maximum and minimum pieces of cakes.

3. **Output Calculation**: The expression `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` does not correctly calculate the maximum possible `x`. The formula does not take into account the distribution rules specified: each plate must have at least one piece, and no plate can have pieces from both cakes.

4. **Missing Checks**: The program does not check that `n` is within the specified bounds (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), nor does it enforce that each plate has at least one piece of cake from only one cake, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

In summary, the program does not follow the problem description accurately in its input handling, calculation logic, and validation, leading to incorrect behavior for various inputs.
