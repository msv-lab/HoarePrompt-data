The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which provides a space-separated string of integers that are converted to integers. Other variables `a` and any existing values of `c` are not affected. The initial state indicates that `n` is constrained to be at least 2 and at most `a + b`, while `b` and `c` can take any integer values based on the input. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment of `n`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= `a + b`; `b` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer.**
