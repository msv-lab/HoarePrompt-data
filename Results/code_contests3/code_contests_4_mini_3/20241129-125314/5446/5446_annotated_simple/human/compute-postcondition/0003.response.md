The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it relies on two integer variables, `a` and `b`, which must satisfy the condition that both are between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function also uses an integer `n`, which must be between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b` (inclusive). 

Based on the output specifications, the function will perform checks and return values accordingly based on the relationships and constraints of `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function checks the integer values of a and b, ensuring they are within the range of 1 to 100, and evaluates n in relation to the sum of a and b, which must be between 2 and (a + b).**
