The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates with two internal integer variables: `a` and `b`, which represent the number of pieces of the first and second cakes respectively, where both `a` and `b` are constrained to be between 1 and 100. Additionally, there is an integer `n` with the constraint that it must satisfy `2 <= n <= a + b`. 

Given this setup, the function's output is not defined in the prompt, but it is implied that the function performs some operation based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since there are no return statements detailed in the provided output, we cannot specify the return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with integer values representing pieces of two cakes without directly accepting parameters, while adhering to the constraints on those values.

Functionality: **The function works with two internal integers a and b representing pieces of cakes, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, but does not return any specified output.**
