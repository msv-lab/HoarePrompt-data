To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. The code snippet assigns the result of the expression `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` to the variable `x`.
2. The variable `b` represents the number of pieces of the second cake and is an integer. The variable `c` was assigned the value of the third integer from input, which is also an integer.
3. The function `max(b, c)` will return the larger of the two integers `b` and `c`.
4. The function `min(b, c)` will return the smaller of the two integers `b` and `c`.
5. The expression `float(min(b, c))` converts the result of `min(b, c)` to a float, allowing for a division that results in a float value for `x`.

The output state will reflect the values of the variables that were affected by the computation, which are `b`, `c`, and the newly computed value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= `a + b`; `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake; `c` is assigned the value of the third integer from input; `x` is max(`b`, `c`) / float(min(`b`, `c`).**
