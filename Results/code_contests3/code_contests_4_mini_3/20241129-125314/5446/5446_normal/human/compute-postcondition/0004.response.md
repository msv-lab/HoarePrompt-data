Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers: `n`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\) and \(1 \leq b, c \leq 100\). It computes the maximum of `b` and `c`, divides it by the minimum of `b` and `c`, and then calculates how many whole pieces of cake (using the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n` times the calculated ratio) are needed. The result is printed as an integer, but the function does not return a value. Additionally, the function may not handle cases where `b` or `c` is zero since it assumes both are at least 1.**
