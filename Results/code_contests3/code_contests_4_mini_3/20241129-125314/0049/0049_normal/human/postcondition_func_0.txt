The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` consisting of lowercase Latin letters of length `n`. It checks if there is at least one character in `c` that is greater than the next character in the string. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based positions of the two characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input string is shorter than `n` or if `n` is less than 2, although it is stated to be at least 2 in the precondition.
