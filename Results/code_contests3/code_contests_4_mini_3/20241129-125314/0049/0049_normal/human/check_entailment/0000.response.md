To assess the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, let's break down the problem and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if reversing a substring of a given string can produce a lexicographically smaller string. If possible, we need to print "YES" along with the indices of the substring to be reversed; otherwise, print "NO".

### Analyzing the Code:
The provided code is structured as follows:
1. It reads an integer `n` and a string `c`.
2. It initializes a flag `flag` to False.
3. It iterates through the string to check if there is any character that is greater than the next character (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`).
4. If such a character exists, it sets `flag` to True and stores the position.
5. Finally, it prints "YES" and the positions of the two characters if `flag` is True; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. The code assumes that `n` is valid and that the string `c` is exactly of length `n`. However, the problem statement guarantees that `n` will be at least 2 and that `c` will have the length of `n`. Therefore, this assumption is theoretically sound based on the problem constraints.
2. The code only finds the first instance where a character is greater than the next one. While this may suffice for the problem's request, it does not handle cases where multiple reverse operations could be valid. However, since the problem allows for any valid substring, this limitation does not necessarily mean the function is incorrect.
3. The code does not check for strings that are already sorted in non-decreasing order, which would correctly return "NO". This is properly handled by the existing logic.

### Output Hints:
The output hints summarize the function's functionality correctly:
- It checks if there's at least one character in `c` that is greater than the next character.
- It prints "YES" if such a character exists and provides the indices of the two characters involved.
- It prints "NO" if no such character pair is found.

### Conclusion:
The code accurately implements the required logic as per the problem description. It correctly identifies if a reversal of a substring could yield a smaller string and handles the provided examples well. 

Given that the code follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases outlined, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
