`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is a string input from the user, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 1.  
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is a string input from the user, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1**
