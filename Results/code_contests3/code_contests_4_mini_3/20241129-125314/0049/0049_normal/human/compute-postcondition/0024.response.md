The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\). `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns an unspecified output based on the logic contained within the function. The details of the output are not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and processes these inputs to produce an output based on its internal logic.**
