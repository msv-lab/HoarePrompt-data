The variable `c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input as a string from the user. The previous value of `n` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the first integer from the input list, and `c` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the first integer from the input list, `c` is a string input from the user.**
