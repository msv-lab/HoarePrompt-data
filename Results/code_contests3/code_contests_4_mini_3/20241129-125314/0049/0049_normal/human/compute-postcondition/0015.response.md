`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `c` is a string input from the user, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `c` is a string input from the user, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2**
