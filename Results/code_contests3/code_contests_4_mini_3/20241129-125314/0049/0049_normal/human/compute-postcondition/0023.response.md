Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, if `flag` is True indicating that at least one character in `c` is greater than the next, then `pos` is the last index where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, and 'YES' is printed along with the output `pos + 1, pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, then `pos` remains undefined, and 'NO' is printed.***
