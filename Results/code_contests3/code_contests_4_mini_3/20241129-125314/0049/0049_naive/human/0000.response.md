To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code:

### Problem Description:
The goal is to determine if it is possible to reverse a substring of a given string such that the resulting string is lexicographically less than the original string. If it is possible, we need to print "YES" and the indices of the substring to be reversed. If not, we print "NO".

### Given Program:
```python
n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = raw_input()
flag = False
for i in range(n - 1):
    if c[i] > c[i + 1]:
        flag = True
        pos = i
if flag:
    print('YES')
    print(pos + 1, pos + 2)
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and a string `c`. This part seems correct.

2. **Logic for Finding Reversable Substring**:
   - The program iterates through the string and checks if there exists any position `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`.
   - If such a position is found, it sets a flag and records the position `pos`. 

3. **Output**:
   - If the flag is set (i.e., a position was found), it prints "YES" and the indices of the characters at positions `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, which corresponds to reversing the substring from `pos` to `pos + 1`.
   - If no such position exists, it prints "NO".

### Potential Flaws:
- The program assumes that finding any two adjacent characters where the left character is greater than the right character is sufficient to ensure that reversing the substring formed by these two characters will yield a string that is lexicographically smaller. However, this is not always the case.
  
- **Counterexample**:
  Consider the string `c = "aabc"`. 
  - Here, `c[1] (a) <= c[2] (b)`, so no adjacent characters are found where the left is greater than the right, and the output would be "NO".
  - However, if we reverse the substring `"aa"` (indices 1 to 2), the string remains the same `"aabc"`, which is not lexicographically smaller. 

- Additionally, the code does not account for the possibility of reversing substrings longer than two characters, which may also yield a lexicographically smaller string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify all potential cases where a substring can be reversed to yield a smaller string. Specifically, it overlooks cases where longer substrings could yield a valid result, and it incorrectly outputs "NO" for strings that actually could be made smaller through other reversals.

Correctness: **False**.
