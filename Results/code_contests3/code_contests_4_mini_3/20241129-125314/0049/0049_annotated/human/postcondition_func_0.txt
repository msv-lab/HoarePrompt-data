The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' followed by the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the last index where this condition is met. If no such index exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return a value, but prints results based on the conditions checked.
