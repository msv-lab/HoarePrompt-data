The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint of being between 2 and 300,000, inclusive. The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` that consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` with specific constraints on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
