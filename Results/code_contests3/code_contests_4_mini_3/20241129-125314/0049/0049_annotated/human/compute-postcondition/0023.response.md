Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If `flag` is True, indicating that there exists at least one `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then `pos` is the last index where this condition occurred, 'YES' is printed along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, `pos` remains undefined, and 'NO' is printed.***
