The variable `n` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will take input, split it into strings, convert each of those strings to an integer, and return an iterable that produces these integers. Since `n` is defined as an integer with the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000, the previous value of `n` is now replaced by the new iterable. The string `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an iterable of integers from the input, and `s` is still a string of length n.

Output State: **`n` is now an iterable of integers from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
