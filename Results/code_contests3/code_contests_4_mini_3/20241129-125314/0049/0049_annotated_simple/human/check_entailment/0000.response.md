The provided program aims to determine if there exists a substring of the given string `s` that can be reversed to form a lexicographically smaller string. Let's analyze the correctness of the program step by step.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the string `s` and then reads the string `s` itself. This part is correct.

2. **Finding Decreasing Pairs**:
   - The program initializes a flag `flag` to `False` and iterates through the string from the first character to the second to last character. 
   - It checks for any position `i` where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to `True` and stores the position in `pos`.
   - This logic correctly identifies potential positions where reversing the substring could lead to a lexicographically smaller string.

3. **Output**:
   - If the flag is `True`, the program outputs "YES" and the indices of the pair found (adjusted for 1-based indexing).
   - If no such pair is found (meaning the string is non-decreasing), it outputs "NO".

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program identifies a valid situation to reverse a substring: when it finds a pair of characters where the first is greater than the second (`c[i] > c[i + 1]`). Reversing this specific two-character substring will create a lexicographically smaller outcome since the first character is greater than the second.
   - The program only needs to find one such pair to satisfy the conditions of the problem, which it correctly does.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the string is strictly increasing (e.g., "abcdef") by returning "NO".
   - It also handles cases where there are multiple valid pairs by only needing to identify one.

Given all of the above, the program follows the problem description correctly in all cases. It checks for the necessary conditions and outputs the required results correctly.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
