According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, meaning that the loop can potentially execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
