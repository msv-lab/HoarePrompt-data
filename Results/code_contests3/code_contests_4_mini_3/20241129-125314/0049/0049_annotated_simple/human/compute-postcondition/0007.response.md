`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 0.**
