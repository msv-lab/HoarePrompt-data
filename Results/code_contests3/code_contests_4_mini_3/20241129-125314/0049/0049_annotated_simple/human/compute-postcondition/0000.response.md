The code is attempting to read input values. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function will convert the input into a list of integers. However, since no specific input value is provided, the output state reflects the intent of the operation without resulting in any specific values for `n` or `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `n` is now a map object containing integers from input.**
