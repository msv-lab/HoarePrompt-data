According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, since the range is from 0 to `n - 1`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute at all. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
