The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks for any pair of adjacent characters in the string where the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
