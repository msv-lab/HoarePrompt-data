To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program and its behavior with different inputs.

**Problem description**: The input is a single integer `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15), and the output should be a single integer based on this input.

**Program**:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

The program uses a predefined list of integers and retrieves the element at the index corresponding to the input value `a`. The list is structured as follows:
```
Index:   0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Value: [15, 14, 12, 13,  8,  9, 10, 11,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7]
```

Now, let's check all possible inputs in the range 0 to 15:

- For `a = 0`, output is `15`
- For `a = 1`, output is `14`
- For `a = 2`, output is `12`
- For `a = 3`, output is `13`
- For `a = 4`, output is `8`
- For `a = 5`, output is `9`
- For `a = 6`, output is `10`
- For `a = 7`, output is `11`
- For `a = 8`, output is `0`
- For `a = 9`, output is `1`
- For `a = 10`, output is `2`
- For `a = 11`, output is `3`
- For `a = 12`, output is `4`
- For `a = 13`, output is `5`
- For `a = 14`, output is `6`
- For `a = 15`, output is `7`

All outputs are valid and correspond to the input within the specified range.

However, there is a potential issue with the code as it uses `raw_input()`, which is a function from Python 2.x. If this code is run in a Python 3.x environment, it would raise a `NameError` since `raw_input()` is not defined (in Python 3.x, the equivalent function is `input()`).

Thus, while the logic of retrieving values from the list based on the input index is correct, the use of `raw_input()` in a Python 3.x context makes the program incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
