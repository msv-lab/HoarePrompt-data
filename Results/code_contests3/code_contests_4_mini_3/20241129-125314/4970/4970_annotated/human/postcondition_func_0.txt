The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for an integer input, which it uses to index into a predefined list. It prints the corresponding value from the list based on the input. Since the input is taken from `raw_input()`, if a user inputs an integer outside the range of 0-15, it will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not handle this exception or provide any output for invalid inputs.
