The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is defined to operate with a non-negative integer `a` that is constrained to the range of 0 to 15. However, since no input is provided when calling the function, the functionality of the function is not explicitly tied to any external parameters. As such, the behavior or output of the function must be inferred or defined elsewhere, but no specific output or behavior is described in the provided output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. Its output is not specified in the provided information.**
