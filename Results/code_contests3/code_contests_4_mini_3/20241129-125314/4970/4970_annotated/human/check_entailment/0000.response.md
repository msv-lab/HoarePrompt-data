Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` to obtain user input, which is not appropriate for environments expecting a single integer argument. The problem description does not indicate that user input should be prompted; instead, it implies that an integer (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) will be provided as an argument to the function.

2. **Output Specification**: The problem description specifies that the function should output a single integer based on the input. However, the function prints the value directly rather than returning it, which may not be considered a proper output in many contexts.

3. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle cases where the input is outside the specified range (0 to 15). If an invalid input is provided, it will raise an `IndexError`, which is not accounted for in the problem description. This means that the program may produce unintended behavior or crashes when given out-of-bounds input.

Due to these issues, the program cannot be considered correct as it does not reliably fulfill the problem description's requirements.
