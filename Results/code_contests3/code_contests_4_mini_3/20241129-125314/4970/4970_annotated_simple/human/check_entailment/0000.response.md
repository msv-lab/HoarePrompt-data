Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the given example, when the input is `3`, the expected output is `13`. However, the program uses the `raw_input()` function to read input, which is not consistent with the use of a function that processes a given integer `a` directly.

Furthermore, the program is designed to retrieve an integer from a predefined list based on the index provided by the user input. The list is defined as: `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. If we analyze the list for the specific input `3`, the output will indeed be `13`, which matches the provided example. However, the program lacks the necessary structure to define a proper function that takes an integer `a` as input and returns the corresponding output.

Moreover, the program does not handle input validation or ensure that `a` is within the specified range (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) before accessing the list, which is critical for correctness.

In summary, while the output for the specific example is correct, the program does not properly implement the requirements of the problem description as a whole. It should define a function that directly accepts an integer input and returns the corresponding output without relying on user input through `raw_input()`.
