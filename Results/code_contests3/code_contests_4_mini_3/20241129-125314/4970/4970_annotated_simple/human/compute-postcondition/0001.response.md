The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= a <= 15. However, since there are no parameters passed into the function, it's not clear how this constraint is utilized within the function. Without additional information on the output or behavior of the function based on the value of `a`, it is not possible to provide a detailed description of the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified based on any input.**
