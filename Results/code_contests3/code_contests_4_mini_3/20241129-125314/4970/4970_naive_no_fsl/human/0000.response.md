To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the program in detail.

### Problem Description:
- Input: A single integer `a` where \(0 \leq a \leq 15\).
- Output: A single integer that corresponds to the input according to the specified behavior.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

1. The program uses a list of integers where the index corresponds to the input integer `a`.
2. The list is defined as:
   ```
   [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
3. For each valid input `a` (from 0 to 15), the program outputs the value at that index in the list.

### Output Examination:
Let's check the output for all possible inputs from 0 to 15:
- For `a = 0`: Output is `15`
- For `a = 1`: Output is `14`
- For `a = 2`: Output is `12`
- For `a = 3`: Output is `13`
- For `a = 4`: Output is `8`
- For `a = 5`: Output is `9`
- For `a = 6`: Output is `10`
- For `a = 7`: Output is `11`
- For `a = 8`: Output is `0`
- For `a = 9`: Output is `1`
- For `a = 10`: Output is `2`
- For `a = 11`: Output is `3`
- For `a = 12`: Output is `4`
- For `a = 13`: Output is `5`
- For `a = 14`: Output is `6`
- For `a = 15`: Output is `7`

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle inputs outside the range [0, 15] because it will throw an `IndexError` if an invalid input is provided. However, based on the problem description, we can assume inputs will always be within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly maps each valid integer input `a` within the range [0, 15] to the corresponding output from the list and does not exhibit any unexpected behavior for the defined input constraints, we can conclude that the program is correct for the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
