The function accepts a non-negative integer input `a` (expected to be between 0 and 15 inclusive) and prints the value from a predefined list at the index specified by `a`. However, if `a` is outside the range of 0 to 15, it may raise an `IndexError` since the list has only 16 elements (indices 0 to 15). The function does not return a value.
