The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since `n` is not a parameter of the function, we cannot determine how it is utilized or how the function behaves regarding its value. Therefore, we cannot specify any return values or behavior based on the input constraints as there are no inputs to evaluate against. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value or behavior is unspecified in the provided context.**
