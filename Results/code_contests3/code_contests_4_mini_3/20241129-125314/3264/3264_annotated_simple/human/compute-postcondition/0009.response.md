Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is set to a value between 1 and 2, a syntax error occurs in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2, and `n` is odd, the results are integers for both expressions. If `n` is even, the output of the print statement is (n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1).***
