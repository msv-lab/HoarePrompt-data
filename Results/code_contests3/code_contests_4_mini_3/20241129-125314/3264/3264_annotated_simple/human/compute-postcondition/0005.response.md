The code calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2`, and the second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. Given that `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, we can calculate the results for each expression.

1. The first expression evaluates to `(n * n - 1) / 2`. Since `n` is odd, `n * n` is odd, and thus `n * n - 1` is even. Dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer.

2. The second expression evaluates to `(n * n + 1) / 2`. Here, since `n * n` is odd, adding 1 makes it even, and thus dividing by 2 also results in an integer.

Since the specific value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute exact numerical results. However, we can conclude that both expressions will yield integer results due to the properties of odd integers.

Therefore, the Output State after evaluating the expressions is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is greater than 2, and `n` is an odd integer; the results are integers for both expressions.**
