Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` obtained from user input and prints specific outputs based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`. If `n` is odd (greater than 2), it prints two values calculated from `n`, specifically `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even (greater than 2), it prints `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`. The function does not return any values, but prints results directly to the output. There is a missing handling for the case when `n` is 1 or 2, as it leads to a scenario that is not described in the annotations.**
