The code snippet is attempting to print a value, but it contains an incorrect syntax. The correct syntax for printing in Python is `print(value)`, not `print - value`. Since the code does not execute successfully due to this syntax error, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is set to a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 and there is a syntax error in the print statement.
Output State: **`n` is set to a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 and there is a syntax error in the print statement.**
