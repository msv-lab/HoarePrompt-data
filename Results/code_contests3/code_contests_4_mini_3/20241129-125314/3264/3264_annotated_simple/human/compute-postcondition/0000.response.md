The value of `n` is assigned the value from `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is not known as it is being reassigned based on user input. Therefore, the output state indicates that `n` is now set to the value provided through input.

Output State: **`n` is set to the value from input as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
