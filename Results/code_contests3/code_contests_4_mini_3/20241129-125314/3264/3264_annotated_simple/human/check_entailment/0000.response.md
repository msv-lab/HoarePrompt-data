Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases described in the problem statement. Specifically, it incorrectly attempts to calculate the Pythagorean triples for both odd and even values of `n`, but the calculations are flawed and they do not ensure that the values printed are indeed valid Pythagorean triples.

1. For `n <= 2`, the program outputs `-1` correctly, as there are no valid Pythagorean triples with a side length of 1 or 2.
2. For odd `n`, the program computes the following:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   
   While these calculations are mathematically sound and yield valid integer results, they do not guarantee that \( n, m, k \) form a Pythagorean triple because it does not check whether \( n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \). 

3. For even `n`, the program computes:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

   Similar to the odd case, while these calculations might yield integers, they do not ensure that the resulting \( n, m, k \) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

4. The output format is also incorrect in terms of printing the values. The program uses a syntax that would lead to a TypeError in Python 3 due to improper handling of division (using `/` instead of `//` for integer division), which also indicates the program would not run correctly in Python 3.

In summary, the program fails to validate the produced triples as Pythagorean triples and also contains syntax issues, leading to incorrect or runtime errors in certain cases. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
