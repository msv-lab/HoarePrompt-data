The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, the output for the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the output based on the value of `n`, we cannot determine the complete functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
