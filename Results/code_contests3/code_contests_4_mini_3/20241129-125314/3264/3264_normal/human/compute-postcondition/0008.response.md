Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer larger than 2. If `n` is odd, the first expression evaluates to (n * n - 1) / 2 and the second expression evaluates to (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, the first expression evaluates to k^2 - 1 and the second expression evaluates to k^2 + 1, where k is n divided by 2.***
