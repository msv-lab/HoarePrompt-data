The code attempts to execute `print - 1`, which is not a valid syntax in Python. Therefore, there is no change to the variables or any output generated. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer from input and less than or equal to 2. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, and `n` is less than or equal to 2; an error occurred due to invalid syntax in print statement.**
