Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, an error occurs due to invalid syntax in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the first expression evaluates to (n * n - 1) / 2 and the second expression evaluates to (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, the first expression evaluates to k^2 - 1 and the second expression evaluates to k^2 + 1, where k is n divided by 2.***
