Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) as input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it outputs -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it calculates and prints two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, it calculates and prints two values: (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). Note that the function does not return any values, but rather prints the results directly. **
