The code executes a print statement that calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. Given that `n` is a positive even integer larger than 2, we will denote `n` as 2k for some integer k where k > 1. 

1. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`. Since `n` is even, we can rewrite it as:
   - `n * n = (2k) * (2k) = 4k^2`
   - Therefore, `n * n / 4 = 4k^2 / 4 = k^2`
   - Hence, `k^2 - 1`.

2. The second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. Continuing from above:
   - `n * n / 4 + 1 = k^2 + 1`.

Since the values of the expressions depend on `n`, we will have two outputs based on the calculations. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and even; the first expression evaluates to `k^2 - 1`, and the second expression evaluates to `k^2 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer larger than 2 and even; the first expression evaluates to `k^2 - 1`, and the second expression evaluates to `k^2 + 1`.**
