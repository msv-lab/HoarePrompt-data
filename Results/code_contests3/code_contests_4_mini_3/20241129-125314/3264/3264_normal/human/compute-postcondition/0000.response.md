The value of `n` is reassigned from a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) to the value obtained from `int(raw_input())`. The previous value of `n` is replaced by the input integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is set to the value of `int(raw_input())`, which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is set to a positive integer from input**
