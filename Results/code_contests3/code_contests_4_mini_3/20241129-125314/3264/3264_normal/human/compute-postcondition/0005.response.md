The code snippet calculates two expressions involving `n`. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Since `n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2, we can express `n` as any odd integer greater than 2 (for example, 3, 5, 7, etc.). 

Calculating the two expressions:

1. For the first expression: 
   - `n * n` is an odd integer squared, which is odd.
   - Therefore, `n * n - 1` is even, and dividing by 2 gives an integer result.

2. For the second expression:
   - `n * n + 1` is also even, and dividing by 2 gives an integer result.

Thus, both expressions will yield integer results.

Since no specific value of `n` is provided but we know itâ€™s a positive integer larger than 2 and odd, we can represent the outputs generally.

Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2; the results of the expressions are integers based on the value of `n`: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2.**
