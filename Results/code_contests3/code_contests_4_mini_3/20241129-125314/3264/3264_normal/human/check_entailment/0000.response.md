To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find a Pythagorean triple given the length of one side of a right triangle, `n`. The output should either be two integers that form a valid Pythagorean triple with `n`, or `-1` if no such triple exists.

### Code Analysis:
Here is the provided code:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

1. **Check for n <= 2**: If `n` is 1 or 2, it outputs `-1`. This is correct since there are no Pythagorean triples involving sides of length 1 or 2.

2. **Odd n**: For odd values of `n`, the code computes:
   - First value: `(n * n - 1) / 2`
   - Second value: `(n * n + 1) / 2`
   
   For odd `n`, these values can be shown to always be valid integers that form a Pythagorean triple with `n`. The derived values satisfy the condition \( n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \).

3. **Even n**: For even values of `n`, the code computes:
   - First value: `(n * n / 4 - 1)`
   - Second value: `(n * n / 4 + 1)`
   
   Here too, the derived values are valid integers forming a Pythagorean triple. 

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The code correctly handles the edge cases of `n = 1` and `n = 2` by returning `-1`.
- The code also handles larger values of `n`, both odd and even, and returns corresponding Pythagorean triples.

### Output Hints:
The output hints provided describe the functionality of the code accurately:
- For inputs less than or equal to `2`, the output is `-1`.
- For odd inputs, it correctly describes how the values are calculated.
- For even inputs, it also explains the calculations.

### Conclusion:
Since the code correctly implements the required logic as per the problem description for all valid inputs, and the output hints agree with the code functionality without any discrepancies or missing logic for edge cases:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code effectively finds Pythagorean triples for all valid cases of `n`, adhering to the requirements outlined in the problem description.
