Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find Pythagorean triples based on the input side length `n`. Specifically, there are issues with how the output values `m` and `k` are calculated and printed.

1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
2. The syntax for printing the output values is incorrect. The program attempts to use a tuple syntax, which will not produce the intended output.
3. The calculation of `m` and `k` for odd `n` is incorrect. The correct formulas to get the Pythagorean triple `(n, m, k)` for an odd integer `n` should be `m = (n^2 - 1) / 2` and `k = (n^2 + 1) / 2`. However, the current code does not ensure that the output is printed correctly.
4. The case where `n` is 2 is not handled correctly. The program outputs `-1` for all values of `n` <= 2, but there are valid Pythagorean triples involving `n = 2` (e.g., (2, 2, âˆš8) or (2, 2, 2.83), where non-integer sides are not valid).
5. The program does not account for even values of `n` properly. In the case of even integers, the calculations should ensure that both `m` and `k` are integers and within the specified range.

For example, when `n = 2`, the expected output should be a valid Pythagorean triple, but the program incorrectly returns `-1`. Hence, the program fails for this case.

Overall, since the program does not work correctly for at least one input case, it is deemed incorrect.
