Correctness: **False**.

The program has several issues, particularly in the way it calculates the outputs for Pythagorean triples. Here are the problems:

1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3; it should be `input()`.
2. The output calculation for odd and even values of `n` is incorrect:
   - For odd `n`, the formula used to print `m` and `k` is correct in general, but the syntax for printing them is incorrect. Instead of using `(print(...))`, it should be replaced with proper variable assignment and then print separately.
   - For even `n`, the formula for `m` and `k` also has a similar issue with printing. Additionally, it uses integer division for the calculations, which could lead to incorrect results.

3. The program does not handle the case when `n` is 2 correctly. It should print `-1`, which is correctly being checked.

4. The program does not check for cases where `n` is a perfect square which also can yield a valid Pythagorean triple.

For example, if we input `n = 2`, the program correctly outputs `-1`, but if we input `n = 4`, the program would incorrectly calculate the outputs using the wrong division and syntax.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
