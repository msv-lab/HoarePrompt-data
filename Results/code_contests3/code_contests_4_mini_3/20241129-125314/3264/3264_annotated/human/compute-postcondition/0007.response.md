The expression inside the print statement calculates two values based on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can compute the results accordingly.

The first value computed is `n * n / 4 - 1`, which simplifies to `(n^2 / 4) - 1`. 

The second value computed is `n * n / 4 + 1`, which simplifies to `(n^2 / 4) + 1`. 

The output will display both results. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2; the first result is `(n^2 / 4) - 1` and the second result is `(n^2 / 4) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer greater than 2; the first result is `(n^2 / 4) - 1` and the second result is `(n^2 / 4) + 1`.**
