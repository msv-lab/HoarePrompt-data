Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is in the range 1 to 2 (inclusive), there is a syntax error in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2, and if `n` is odd, the results are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, the first result is `(n^2 / 4) - 1` and the second result is `(n^2 / 4) + 1`.***
