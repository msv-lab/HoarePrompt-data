The expression calculates two values based on the given integer `n`. The first value is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second value is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Given that `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, let's denote `n` as some specific odd integer within the defined range. However, since no specific value is provided, we can express the results in terms of `n`.

Calculating the two expressions:
1. The first expression evaluates to `(n * n - 1) / 2`.
2. The second expression evaluates to `(n * n + 1) / 2`.

Both expressions depend on the specific value of `n`, but they will yield two consecutive integers because `n * n` is odd (since the square of an odd number is odd), and subtracting or adding 1 gives us the two consecutive even integers.

Thus, the output state will represent these two calculated values in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 10^9 and `n` > 2; the results are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`.**
