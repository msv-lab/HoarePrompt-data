The function accepts a positive integer `n` via user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, it prints `(n^2 / 4) - 1` and `(n^2 / 4) + 1`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results directly. There is a potential issue with the print statement when `n` is less than or equal to 2, which may lead to a syntax error.
