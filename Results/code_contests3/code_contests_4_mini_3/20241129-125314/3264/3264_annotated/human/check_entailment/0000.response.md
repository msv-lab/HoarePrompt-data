Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Condition for n <= 2**: The program correctly prints -1 for n values of 1 and 2, as specified in the problem description. However, it states that there is a syntax error in the print statement, which is inaccurate. The primary issue is not with syntax but with the logic surrounding those values.

2. **Calculating Pythagorean triples**:
   - For odd `n`, it calculates `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2` as the other two sides of the triangle. These expressions will always yield integers, but they do not guarantee that the values form a Pythagorean triple for all odd integers. For example, if n = 3, it correctly produces (4, 5), but for other odd integers, it may not always yield valid Pythagorean triples.
   - For even `n`, it calculates `(n^2 / 4) - 1` and `(n^2 / 4) + 1`. This means that for n = 6, it produces (8, 10), which is indeed a valid triple. However, similar to the odd case, there is no guarantee that all even integers will yield valid triples.

3. **Output format**: The program outputs two numbers separated by a space when n > 2, but it does not ensure that it prints the results in the required format for all cases, especially if the calculated values exceed the specified range of 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18.

4. **General cases**: The algorithm does not handle or validate all cases comprehensively. For instance, if the input is an odd number greater than 2 that does not correspond to a valid Pythagorean triple, the algorithm would still attempt to calculate and print values that do not satisfy the condition of forming a right triangle.

Due to these reasons, the program does not consistently adhere to the requirements stated in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
