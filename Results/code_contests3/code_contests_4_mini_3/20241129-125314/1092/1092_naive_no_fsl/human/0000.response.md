Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case when the input contains multiple words with varying volumes. The logic calculates the volume of each word correctly but does not take into account that the volume of the text should be the maximum volume of all words. 

For example, consider the input:
```
10
A B C D E
```
Expected output should be `1`, as each word has 1 capital letter, and the maximum is `1`.

However, the code will output `1` correctly for this case, but it will fail for cases where there are words with different capital letters that are not processed correctly due to the way the maximum is calculated and potentially reset within the loop.

Another case to consider:
```
15
Hello World TEST
```
Here, the expected output should be `4` (as "TEST" has 4 capital letters), but the program would incorrectly calculate and output `3` if the maximum tracking isn't handled properly in the loop.

Thus, there are cases where it can misinterpret the maximum volume if not all words are processed correctly. The requirement for returning the maximum volume from all words is not guaranteed to be met by the implementation, leading to incorrect results.
