The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. This directly impacts the previous value of `s`, which was the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`. Since `s` is now explicitly set to `0`, it overrides any previous value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, and `s` is now 0.
