The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; however, it operates under the constraints that the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the `text` is a single line of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters with a total length of `n`. The output of the function is not specified in your instructions, so we cannot determine the specific return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with an integer `n` and a `text` that adheres to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a text that is a single line of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters with a total length of n. The return value is not specified.**
