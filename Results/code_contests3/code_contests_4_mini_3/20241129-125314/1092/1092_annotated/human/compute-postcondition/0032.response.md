The value of `s` is assigned 0, which directly affects the previous value of `s` that was computed as the count of uppercase letters in `i`. Since `s` is reset to 0, it is no longer reflecting the count of uppercase letters in `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is now the maximum of `s` and its previous value; `l` is a list containing at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list `l`; `s` is now 0.
