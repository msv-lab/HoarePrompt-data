According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If `l` contains more than 2 words, the loop can execute again for the third word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second word in the list `l`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` must contain at least 3 words, and `i` must be updated to the third word in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is now the maximum of `s` and its previous value; `l` is a list containing at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list `l`; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
