According to the code, the loop is structured to iterate over the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be an iterable. Since `i` is currently set to the first word of the list, it must be a string (or another iterable type) to allow the loop to iterate over its characters.

Given that `i` is the first word from the list `l`, the loop will iterate over each character in that word. The variable `j` will take on the value of each character in `i` during each iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that the loop will execute over the characters of the string `i`. Since `i` is already defined as the first word in the list `l`, no adjustment is needed for `i` specifically; however, we must ensure that the loop can execute and the first character is accessible.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the first character of the word `i`.**
