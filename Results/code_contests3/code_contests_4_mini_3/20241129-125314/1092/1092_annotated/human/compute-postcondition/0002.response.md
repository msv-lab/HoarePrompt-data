`m` is assigned the value of 0. The states of the other variables, `n` and `l`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of words obtained from splitting the input line of text; `m` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of words obtained from splitting the input line of text; `m` is 0**
