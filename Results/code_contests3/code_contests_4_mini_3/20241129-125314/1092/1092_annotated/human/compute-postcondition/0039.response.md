Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is the maximum of `s` and its previous value; `l` is a list containing at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list `l` and is a non-empty string; `j` is the next character in the string `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is incremented by 1.***
