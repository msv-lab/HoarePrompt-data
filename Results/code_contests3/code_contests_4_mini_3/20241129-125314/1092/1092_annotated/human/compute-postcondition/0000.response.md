The `raw_input()` function is used to accept input from the user as a string. In this case, it will read a single line of text which consists of words separated by spaces. The variable `n` indicates the length of this input string and falls within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200). Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the expectation of a single line of input based on the constraints provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; the text is a single line of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters with a total length of n.**
