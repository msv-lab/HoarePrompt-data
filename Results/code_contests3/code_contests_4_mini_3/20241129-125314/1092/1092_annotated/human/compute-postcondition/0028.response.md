Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `j` is the third character of `i`. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
