The value of `m` is updated to the maximum of `s` and its previous value. The value of `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`, and `m` is the maximum of `s` and its previous value. The previous value of `m` is not specified, but it can be any value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `m` is now equal to the maximum of `s` and its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is updated to max(s, m); `l` is a list containing at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list `l` and is a non-empty string; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`.**
