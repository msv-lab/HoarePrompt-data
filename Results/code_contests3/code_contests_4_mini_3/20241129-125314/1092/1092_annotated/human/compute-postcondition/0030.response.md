`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The value of `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`, and since `m` can either be equal to `s` or remain 0, the new value of `m` will depend on the comparison with `s`. Therefore, the output state describes the possible values of `m` based on the values of `s` and the prior state of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is now the maximum of `s` and its previous value; `l` is a list containing at least 2 words; `i` is the second word in the list `l`; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
