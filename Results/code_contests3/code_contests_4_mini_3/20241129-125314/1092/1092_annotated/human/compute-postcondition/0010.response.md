`s` is incremented by 1, so its previous value of `s` which is 1 becomes 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character of the word `i` (if `i` has at least 2 characters).
