According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. Given that `i` is the second word in the list `l` and is not an empty string, it contains at least one character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been assigned the next character from the string `i`. Since `i` is not empty, it implies that there are still characters left in `i` for the loop to execute one more time. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The character `j` will be the next character in `i`.
2. If `i` has `k` characters, after the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` will need to be the character at index `n` of `i`, where `n` is the index of the next character, and `k` must be greater than `n`.

Since `i` is the second word in the list `l`, we also note that `l` must have at least 2 words.

Summarizing these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l` and is not an empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be the next character in `i`.**
