The code prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word from the list `l`. The value of other variables (`n`, `i`, and `s`) does not change as a result of this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word from the list `l`; `l` is a list of words; `i` is the last word in the list `l`; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the last word `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word from the list `l`; `l` is a list of words; `i` is the last word in the list `l`; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the last word `i`**.
