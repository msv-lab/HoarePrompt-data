According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If the list has more words, the loop can execute again for the next word. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and since `l` contains at least 1 word, we need to consider the situation for the next iteration.

After the first iteration, the loop will advance to the next word in the list. Therefore, if `i` is currently the first word, it will become the second word when the loop executes again. For the loop to execute a second time, the list must have at least 2 words.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`.**
