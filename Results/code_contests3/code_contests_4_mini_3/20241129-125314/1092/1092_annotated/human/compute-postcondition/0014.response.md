Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `s` is 2. If `j` is an uppercase character, then `s` is updated to 3 and `j` remains the third character of `i` (if `i` has at least 3 characters).***
