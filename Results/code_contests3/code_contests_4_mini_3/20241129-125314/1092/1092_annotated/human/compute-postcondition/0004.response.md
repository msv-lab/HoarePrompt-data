The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list `l`; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list `l`; `s` is 0.**
