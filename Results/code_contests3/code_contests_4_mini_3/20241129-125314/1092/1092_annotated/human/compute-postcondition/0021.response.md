The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is currently 0, after execution, `s` will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list containing at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l` and is not an empty string, `s` is now 1, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
