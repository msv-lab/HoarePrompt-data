The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and its previous value, `l` is a list containing at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l` and is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase string.
