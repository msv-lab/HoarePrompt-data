Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list with at least 3 characters, and `j` is the third character of `i`. If `j` is uppercase, `s` is increased by 1. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged.***
