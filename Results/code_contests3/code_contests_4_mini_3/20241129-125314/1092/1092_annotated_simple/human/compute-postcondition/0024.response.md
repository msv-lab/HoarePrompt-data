The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is either 1 or 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` will either be 2 or 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is either 2 or 1.**
