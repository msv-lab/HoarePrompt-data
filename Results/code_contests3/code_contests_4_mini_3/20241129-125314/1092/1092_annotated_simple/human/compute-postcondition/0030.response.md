`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the count of uppercase letters in `i`) and `m` (the number of uppercase letters previously counted). The values of `s` and `m` will determine the new value of `m`, but the specific values are not provided. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
