Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s + 1` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `j` is not an uppercase character. If `j` is an uppercase character, the condition is not met, and the program does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, or `i`.***
