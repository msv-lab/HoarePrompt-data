The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of words based on spaces. The variable `l` is assigned this list. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `text` is also unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `l`, which is a list containing the words from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters; `l` is a list of words from input**.
