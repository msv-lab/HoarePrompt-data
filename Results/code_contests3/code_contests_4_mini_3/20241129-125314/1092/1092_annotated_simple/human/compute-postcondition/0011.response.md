Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is 2 if the second character `j` of the first word `i` is an uppercase letter. If `i` has at least 2 characters, then `j` is the second character of `i`.***
