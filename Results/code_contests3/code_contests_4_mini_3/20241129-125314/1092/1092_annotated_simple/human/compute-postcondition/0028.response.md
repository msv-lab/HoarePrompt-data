Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list (a non-empty string with at least 3 characters), and `s` is either 1 or 2. If `j` is uppercase, then `n` remains within 1 to 200, `m` remains either `s` or 0, `l` remains a list with at least 2 words, `i` remains the second word in `l`, and `s` is either 2 or 3.***
