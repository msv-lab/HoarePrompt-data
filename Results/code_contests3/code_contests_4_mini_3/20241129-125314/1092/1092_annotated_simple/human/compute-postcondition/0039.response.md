Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s + 1` and the previous `m` if `j` is an uppercase character. If `j` is not uppercase, `m` remains unchanged. `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `j` is the second character of `i`.***
