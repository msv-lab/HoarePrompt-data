According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has more words, the loop can execute again for the next word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list, and `l` contains at least 1 word. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the second word in the list, and we need to ensure that the list `l` has at least 2 words.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the second word `i`.**
