Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list (which is a non-empty string), and `s` is 1 if `j` is a string where all characters are uppercase. If `j` is not uppercase, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
