The variable `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
