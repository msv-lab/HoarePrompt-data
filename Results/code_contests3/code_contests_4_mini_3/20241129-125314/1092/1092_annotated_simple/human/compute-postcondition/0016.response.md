`m` is assigned the value of the maximum between `s` and `m`. Since `m` is initially 0, `m` will be updated to the value of `s` if `s` is greater than 0. The value of `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the first word `i`, which is at least 0. Therefore, `m` will become either `s` or remain 0 if `s` is also 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the first word `i`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the first word `i`.**
