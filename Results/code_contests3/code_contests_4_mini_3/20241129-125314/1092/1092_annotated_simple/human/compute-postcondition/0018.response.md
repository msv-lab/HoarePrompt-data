The variable `s` is assigned the value of `0`, which means it is being reset to zero. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. The previous value of `s` is not mentioned but is now explicitly set to `0`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `s` and the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 0**
