The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is unknown, and since `j` is not an uppercase character, the value of `m` remains the same as it was previously. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s + 1` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `j` is not an uppercase character.
