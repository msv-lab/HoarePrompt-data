The value of `s` is assigned 0, which resets the previous count of uppercase letters in `i`. Since `s` is directly assigned a value, it does not depend on any previous calculations or values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is now 0.
