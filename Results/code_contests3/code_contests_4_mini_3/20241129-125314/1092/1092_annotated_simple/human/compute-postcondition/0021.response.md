The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and since `s` starts at 0, after execution, `s` will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list (which is a non-empty string), `s` is 1, and `j` is a string where all characters are uppercase.
