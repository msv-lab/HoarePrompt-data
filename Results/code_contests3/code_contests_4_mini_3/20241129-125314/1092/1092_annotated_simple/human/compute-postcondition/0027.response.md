The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` can be either 1 or 2. If `s` is 1, it becomes 2; if `s` is 2, it becomes 3. The values of the other variables `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is either 2 or 3.**
