Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list (a non-empty string with at least 2 characters), and `s` is either 1 or 2. If `j` is a string where all characters are uppercase, then `s` is set to 1. If `j` is not all uppercase, there are no changes made to the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, or `s`.***
