The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` (the count of uppercase letters in `i`) and the previous value of `m`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, previous m), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, previous m), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
