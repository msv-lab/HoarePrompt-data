The `raw_input()` function is used to accept input from the user, but it does not modify any existing variables `n` or `text`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `text` remain unchanged. Since `raw_input()` simply waits for user input and does not affect the previous state of the variables, we note that the state of the other variables is unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
