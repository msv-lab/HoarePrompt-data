Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and reads a line of input consisting of words. It processes these words to count the number of uppercase letters in each word and returns the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any of those words. The function does not actually take parameters as stated in the annotations, and it does not handle cases where no words are entered (leading to a maximum count of 0). **
