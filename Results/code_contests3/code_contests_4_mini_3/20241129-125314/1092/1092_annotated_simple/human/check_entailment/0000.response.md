To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let’s break down the requirements and the implementation step-by-step.

### Problem Description Analysis:
1. **Input Requirements**:
   - The first line is an integer `n` which represents the length of the text (1 ≤ n ≤ 200).
   - The second line is a string of words separated by single spaces.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The output should be a single integer representing the "volume of the text," defined as the maximum number of capital letters in any single word of the text.

### Program Analysis:
- The function begins by reading the number `n`, which is not actually used in the computation.
- It reads the text and splits it into a list of words `l`.
- It initializes a variable `m` to keep track of the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any of the words.
- For each word in the list:
  - It initializes a counter `s` to count the uppercase letters in the current word.
  - It iterates through each letter in the word; if the letter is uppercase (`j.isupper()`), it increments the counter `s`.
  - After processing the letters of the word, it updates `m` to be the maximum of `s` and `m`.
- Finally, it prints `m`, which represents the maximum volume (number of uppercase letters) of any word in the text.

### Correctness Check:
1. The program correctly counts the uppercase letters in each word.
2. It correctly updates the maximum count of uppercase letters found across all words.
3. It outputs the correct maximum volume after processing all words.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- If the input contains only lowercase letters, the program will return 0, which is correct.
- If the input contains multiple words with varying cases, the program correctly identifies the word with the maximum uppercase letters.
- The function effectively handles the specified range of inputs (1 ≤ n ≤ 200).

### Conclusion:
The implementation adheres to the problem description. It accurately calculates the volume of the text by determining the maximum number of capital letters in any of the words, and outputs this value correctly.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
