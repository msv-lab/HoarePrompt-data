Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum volume of the words in the text. The issue arises in the inner loop where it calculates the volume of each word. Specifically, the program initializes `s = 0` for each word but doesn't account for the maximum volume correctly because it sets `m = max(s, m)` after the inner loop, which only compares the last word's volume to the maximum found so far.

For example, consider the input:
```
25
Hello World TEST
```
The expected output is `4` because "TEST" has 4 capital letters, but the program will output `0` because the variable `m` is initialized incorrectly after checking each word.

Thus, the logic fails for cases where multiple words contain capital letters, and the maximum isn't correctly updated for all words.
