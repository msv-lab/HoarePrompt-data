The function accepts an integer `n` (from 1 to 200) and a string `text` that contains single-space separated words. It counts the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any single word from `text` and prints this maximum count. If there are no uppercase letters in any word, it will print 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
