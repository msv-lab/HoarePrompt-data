According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 3 words, the loop can execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 words, and `i` is the second word in the list `l`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be updated to the third word in the list, and the length of `l` must be at least 3 words.

State: **`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the third word `i`, `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`.**
