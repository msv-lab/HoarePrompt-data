`s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 3, and `j` is the third character of `i` (if `i` has at least 3 characters).
