The code `raw_input()` is designed to accept an input from the user, typically in the context of Python 2. However, since there is no actual value being provided or assigned to a variable, the current state of `n` remains unchanged. The `text` variable is also unaffected as no operations are performed on it. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 200 (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `text` is a single line containing single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
