The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is uppercase.
