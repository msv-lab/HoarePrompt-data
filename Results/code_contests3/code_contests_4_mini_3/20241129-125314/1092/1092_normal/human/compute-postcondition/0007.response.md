The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `text`, `l`, `i`, `m`, `j`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.**
