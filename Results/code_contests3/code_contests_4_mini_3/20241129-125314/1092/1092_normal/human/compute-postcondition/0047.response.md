The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the function signature. Instead, it relies on external input constraints where `n` is an integer in the range from 1 to 200 (inclusive), and `text` is a single line containing single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters. 

The function processes this input and produces output based on the defined relationships. However, the specific output behavior is not provided in your prompt, so I cannot detail the exact return values or conditions based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` in the range of 1 to 200 and a string `text` consisting of single-space separated words, but the specific output behavior based on these inputs is not detailed.**
