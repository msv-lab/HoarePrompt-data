Postcondition: ***`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, `s` is updated to be the count of uppercase characters in `i` plus 1 if `j` is an uppercase character, while `m` remains as the maximum of the previous `m` and the original value of `s`. If `j` is not uppercase, `s` remains unchanged and `m` still reflects the maximum of the previous `m` and the original value of `s`.***
