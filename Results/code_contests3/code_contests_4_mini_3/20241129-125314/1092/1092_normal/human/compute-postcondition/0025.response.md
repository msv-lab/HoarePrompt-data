Postcondition: ***`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0. If the second character `j` of `i` is uppercase, then `s` is updated to 2 and `j` remains uppercase. Otherwise, `s` remains 1 and `j` is the second character of `i`, which is uppercase if `j.isupper()` is true.***
