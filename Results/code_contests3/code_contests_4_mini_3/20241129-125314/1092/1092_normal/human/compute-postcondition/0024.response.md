The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character of `i`, which is uppercase if `j.isupper()` is true.
