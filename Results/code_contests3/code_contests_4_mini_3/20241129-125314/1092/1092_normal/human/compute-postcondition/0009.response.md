According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the first character of that word. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to the next character in the word `i`. 

Since `i` is a non-empty string and `j` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `j` is set to the second character of the string `i`. Additionally, since the length of `i` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again, we know that `i` is a string with at least 2 characters. 

Therefore, the state adjustments will reflect that `j` is now the second character in `i`, and we should indicate that `i` must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `j` is the second character of `i`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must have at least 2 characters.**
