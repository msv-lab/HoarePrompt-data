The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `s` is unknown, but since `i` is required to have at least 4 characters for the loop to execute one more time, we can confirm that the loop is continuing. The values of `n`, `text`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as this operation only affects `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is increased by 1.**
