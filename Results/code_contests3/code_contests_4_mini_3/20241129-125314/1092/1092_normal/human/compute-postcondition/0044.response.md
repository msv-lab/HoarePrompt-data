The variable `m` is updated to the maximum of `s` and its previous value. The values of `s` and `m` are both required to determine the new value of `m`. Since `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, and `m` previously held another value, the output state reflects that `m` will now be the greater of the two. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is in the range 1 to 200, `text` is a non-empty string, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, and `m` is updated to the maximum of `s` and its previous value.
