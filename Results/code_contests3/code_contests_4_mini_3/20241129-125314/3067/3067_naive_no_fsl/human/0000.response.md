Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `l_i` and `r_i` are given as the input for the substring. The problem states that `l_i` and `r_i` are inclusive, but the way the program computes the number of occurrences of the substring `AC` is incorrect because it uses `P[l - 1]` to subtract from `P[r - 1]`. 

When `l_i = 1` and `r_i = 8`, the program should consider the substring from index 1 to 8 (inclusive), which corresponds to the whole string. However, the calculation of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` does not account for the entire substring correctly because it uses a zero-based index instead of one-based indexing for queries.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
8 1
ACACTACG
1 8
```

The expected output should be `3`, as `AC` occurs three times in the full string `ACACTACG`. However, the program calculates:

```
P[7] - P[0] = 3 - 0 = 3
```

In this case, it works correctly, but let's take another case:

```
8 1
ACACTACG
3 7
```

Here, the expected output should be `0`, as the substring `ACTAC` does not contain `AC` at all. The program calculates:

```
P[6] - P[2] = 2 - 1 = 1
```

This means the program incorrectly counts the occurrences in the provided range. Thus, the program fails for the input `3 7`:

- Expected output: `0`
- Actual output: `1`

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
