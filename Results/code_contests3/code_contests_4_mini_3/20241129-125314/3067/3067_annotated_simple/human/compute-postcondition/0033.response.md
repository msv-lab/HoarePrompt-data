To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. `N` is a non-negative integer, which suggests it could take any value from 0 upwards.
2. `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 0. This means the first element of the list is 0, and the rest of the elements depend on how `P` is populated (which is not provided in this context).
3. `l` and `r` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, which means they are input values that have been split and converted into integers.

The line of code `print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])` calculates the difference between the elements of list `P` at indices `r - 1` and `l - 1`. This means:

- We need to ensure that `r` and `l` are valid indices for the list `P`.
- The specific values of `l` and `r` are not defined in the initial state.

Since `P` is not fully defined but we know `P[0]` is 0, we can determine that `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` are the values at those indices, based on the input values `l` and `r`.

However, as we do not have specific values for `l` and `r`, we note that they could be any integer values greater than or equal to 1, and thus, their specific output cannot be calculated without that information.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the operations performed and the conditions met, rather than a specific numerical result. 

Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer; `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 0; `l` and `r` are input integers; the output is the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]`.**
