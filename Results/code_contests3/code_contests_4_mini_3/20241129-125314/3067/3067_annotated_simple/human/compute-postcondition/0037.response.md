Output State: **`N` is a non-negative integer; `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 0; after executing the loop `Q` times, the output will consist of the differences `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` for each pair of integers `l` and `r` read from input, where each output represents the count of 'AC' substrings in the specified range.**
