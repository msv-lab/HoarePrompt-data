According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `N` must be at least 1 because the range function generates numbers from 0 to `N-1`. If `N` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are that `N` should be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
