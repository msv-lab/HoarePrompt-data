The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
