According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `Q`, which represents the number of iterations the loop is set to run. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `N` is a non-negative integer, `P` is a list with `P[0]` being 0, and `l` and `r` have been assigned values from user input. 

The loop will execute again if `_` (the loop variable) is less than `Q`. Since we are not given the current value of `_`, we can infer that after the last iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` must be less than `Q`. Therefore, if the current iteration was the `_`-th iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` must be equal to `Q - 1` or less, and will increment to `Q`.

State: **`N` is a non-negative integer; `P` is a list where `P[0]` is 0; `l` and `r` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, split and converted to integers; for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be equal to `Q - 1`.**
