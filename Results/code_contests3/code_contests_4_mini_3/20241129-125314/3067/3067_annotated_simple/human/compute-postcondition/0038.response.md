The function `func` does not explicitly mention any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided context, it operates on the following parameters:

1. `S`: a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
2. `N`: an integer representing the length of the string `S`, where `2 <= N <= 100000`.
3. `Q`: an integer representing the number of queries, where `1 <= Q <= 100000`.
4. For each query, `l_i` and `r_i`: integers such that `1 <= l_i < r_i <= N`.

The function processes these queries (l_i, r_i) and returns results based on the content of string `S` between the specified indices for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and integers N and Q, where N is the length of the string and Q is the number of queries. It processes each query defined by the indices l_i and r_i and returns results based on the substring of S between these indices.**
