The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`. The values of `N` and `P[0]` do not change in this operation, and since `i` is not equal to 0, we proceed without any changes to `P[0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1**
