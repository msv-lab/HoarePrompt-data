`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`. The variable `N` represents the length of the string `S`, which implies that `P` will have `N + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. Other variables (`N`, `Q`, and `S`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`**
