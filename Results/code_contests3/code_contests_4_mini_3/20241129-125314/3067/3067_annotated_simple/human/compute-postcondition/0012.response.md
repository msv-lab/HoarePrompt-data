Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` cannot be computed due to undefined `P[i - 1]`. Otherwise, if the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not equal to 'AC', `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, which is also not defined in this context since `i` is 0.***
