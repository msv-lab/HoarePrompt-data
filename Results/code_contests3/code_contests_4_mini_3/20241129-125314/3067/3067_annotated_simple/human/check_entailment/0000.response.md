Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here is a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the length of the string `N`, the number of queries `Q`, the string `S`, and then the queries which consist of pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)`.

2. **Counting Substrings**: The program constructs an array `P` where each entry `P[i]` counts the occurrences of the substring "AC" from the start of the string `S` up to index `i`. This is done through a single pass over the string, ensuring an efficient O(N) time complexity.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program computes the count of "AC" substrings in the substring `S[l_i:r_i]` using the precomputed counts in `P`. The difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` correctly gives the number of "AC" substrings between the specified indices, as it subtracts the cumulative counts up to `l-1` from the cumulative counts up to `r-1`.

4. **Output**: The outputs for each query are printed line by line as required.

5. **Correctness in Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `l` and `r` are very close together, or when `l` and `r` span the entire string. The constraints are respected, ensuring that the input values are always valid.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description, efficiently counts the required substrings, and outputs the correct results for each query. Thus, it is a correct implementation.
