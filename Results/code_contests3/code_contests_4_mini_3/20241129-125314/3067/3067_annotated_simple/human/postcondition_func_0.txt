The function accepts a string `S` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and two integers `N` (the length of the string) and `Q` (the number of queries). It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` from the start up to each index and allows for multiple queries to return the count of 'AC' substrings within specific ranges defined by pairs of integers `l` and `r`. The output for each query is the difference in counts between indices `r-1` and `l-1`, effectively providing the count of 'AC' substrings in the substring `S[l-1:r]`. This function handles substring queries efficiently but does not validate the input constraints or handle cases where `l` or `r` are outside the valid range.
