According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `Q`, which represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since the loop is set to run for `Q` iterations, if the loop has executed once, it means there is still at least one iteration left for it to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `P` is an array of length `N + 1`, and the values of `l` and `r` are taken from user input for that iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `Q` must be greater than the number of iterations already executed.
- The values of `l` and `r` for the next iteration need to be defined, typically through user input.

Since the loop executes one more time, the number of completed iterations increments by 1. Therefore, if we denote the completed iterations by `_`, it will be incremented to `_ + 1`.

State: **`P` is an array of length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are integers from user input, for the loop to execute one more time `Q` must be greater than `_ + 1`**
