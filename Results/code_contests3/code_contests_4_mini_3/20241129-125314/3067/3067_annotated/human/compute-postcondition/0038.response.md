The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with a length between 2 and 100,000. It also accepts a parameter `Q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries, with a value between 1 and 100,000. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where 1 <= `l_i` < `r_i` <= N (the length of string `S`). 

The function processes these parameters and returns results based on the queries. The specific outputs are not detailed, but they are derived from the string `S` and the indices provided by the queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer Q for the number of queries, each defined by indices l_i and r_i. It processes the queries based on the string S and returns results corresponding to those queries.**
