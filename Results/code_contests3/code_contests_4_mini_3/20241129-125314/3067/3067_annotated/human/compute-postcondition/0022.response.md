The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and jump to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
