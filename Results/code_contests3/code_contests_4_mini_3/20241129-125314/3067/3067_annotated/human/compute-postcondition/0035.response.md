The values of `l` and `r` are assigned based on the user input, which is split into two integers. The other variables, `P`, `N`, and `Q`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `l` and `r` as input integers.

Output State: **`P` is an array of length `N + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
