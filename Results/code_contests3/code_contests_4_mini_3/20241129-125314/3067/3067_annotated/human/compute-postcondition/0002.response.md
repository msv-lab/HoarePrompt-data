`P` is assigned a list that contains `N + 1` zeros. The value of `N` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `S`, so `P` will be a list with `N + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `Q` is a positive integer, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `Q` is a positive integer, `S` is an input string, `P` is a list of `N + 1` zeros**
