The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, `P[1]` will take the value of `P[0]`. However, we don't have the specific value of `P[0]` provided in the initial state, but we know that if `i` were equal to 0, then `P[0]` would be assigned the value 0. Since `i` is 1, we are not at that condition, and we are merely copying the value from `P[0]` to `P[1]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 1; `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]**.
