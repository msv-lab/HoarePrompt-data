The code assigns the value of `P[i]` to be `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, it will access `P[2]` and set it to `P[1] + 1`. The previous values of `P[1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `P[2]`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is set to `P[1] + 1`, where the specific value of `P[1]` remains unknown.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is set to `P[1] + 1`**
