The value of `P[0]` is assigned 0. Since `P` is not defined in the initial state, it can be assumed that `P` is a list or an array capable of holding values, and `P[0]` is now set to 0. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0**
