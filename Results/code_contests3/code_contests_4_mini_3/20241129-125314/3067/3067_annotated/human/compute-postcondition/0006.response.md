The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
