Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It calculates the cumulative count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to each index and allows `Q` queries that return the number of 'AC' occurrences between the specified indices `l_i` and `r_i`. The function does not handle cases where `l_i` or `r_i` are out of the specified range or where `S` is not properly formatted. **
