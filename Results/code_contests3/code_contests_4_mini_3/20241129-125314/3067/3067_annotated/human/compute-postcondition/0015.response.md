The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the program to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration if it is within a loop structure. Since no values are altered and we do not have information about any loop context, the Output State remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `P[0]` is assigned the value 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
