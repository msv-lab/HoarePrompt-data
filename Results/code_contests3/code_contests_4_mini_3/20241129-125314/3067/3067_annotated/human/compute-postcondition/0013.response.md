According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `N`. Given that `N` is a positive integer greater than 0 and `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. This means that in the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1 since the loop will continue until `i` is equal to `N - 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1.**
