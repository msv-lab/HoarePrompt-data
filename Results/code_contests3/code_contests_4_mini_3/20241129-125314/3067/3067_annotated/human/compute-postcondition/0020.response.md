According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is a positive integer greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2.**
