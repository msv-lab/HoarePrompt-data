To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirements and how the program is structured.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We have a string `S` of length `N` containing characters `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`.
2. We need to process `Q` queries, where each query gives us two indices `l_i` and `r_i` (1-based) and we must count the occurrences of the substring `AC` within the substring of `S` from `l_i` to `r_i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the values of `N` and `Q`, and then the string `S`. This aligns with the problem description.
   
2. **Prefix Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs an array `P` such that `P[i]` contains the cumulative count of occurrences of the substring `AC` from the start of the string up to index `i`.
   - The condition `if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':` checks for the occurrence of `AC` starting from the current position. If found, it increments the count from the previous index, which is correctly implemented.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - For each query, the program computes the number of occurrences of `AC` in the substring `S[l-1:r]` using the formula `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. This correctly gives the number of `AC` substrings between the indices `l_i` and `r_i` (converted to 0-based indexing).

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `l_i` and `r_i` are valid according to the constraints provided (1 ≤ l_i < r_i ≤ N).
- It correctly constructs the prefix sum for `AC` occurrences, ensuring that the counting is accurate and efficient, given the constraints (up to 100,000 for both `N` and `Q`).

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly counts the occurrences of the substring `AC` for the queries provided, handles the prefix sum calculation, and adheres to the input constraints.

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
