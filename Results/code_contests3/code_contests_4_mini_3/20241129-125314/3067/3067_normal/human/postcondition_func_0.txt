The function accepts a string `S` of length `N` (where 2 <= N <= 100000) and an integer `Q` (where 1 <= Q <= 100000). It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` and allows for `Q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `(l, r)`. For each query, it returns the number of times 'AC' appears in the substring `S[l-1:r]`. The function does not handle invalid inputs for `l` and `r`, which must be within the valid range of the string length.
