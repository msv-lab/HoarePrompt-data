`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `P[1]` is set to the value of `P[0]`. Since `P` is initially filled with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, which means `P[1]` will also be 0 after this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, and `P[1]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, and `P[1]` is 0.**
