Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1`. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is set to `i`, meaning `P` will contain the values `P[1]` as 1, `P[2]` as 2, up to `P[i]`. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains 0, indicating that no update occurred for that index in the list `P`.***
