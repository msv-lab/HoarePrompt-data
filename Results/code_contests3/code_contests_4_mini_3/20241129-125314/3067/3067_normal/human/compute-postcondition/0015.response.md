The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
