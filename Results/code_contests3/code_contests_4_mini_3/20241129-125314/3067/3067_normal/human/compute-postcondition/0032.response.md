The code assigns the values obtained from `raw_input()` to `l` and `r` after converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state specifies that `l` and `r` are integers from raw input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `l` and `r` have been updated to the new values from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to values from raw input.**
