Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[0]` remains 0 and `P[1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `P[0]` remains 0 and `P[1]` is set to 0.***
