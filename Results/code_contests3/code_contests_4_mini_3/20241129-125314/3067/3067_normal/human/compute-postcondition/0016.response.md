Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, and `i` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, we skip the current iteration of the loop, and `P[0]` remains 0.***
