The function `func` accepts three parameters: a string `S`, an integer `N`, and an integer `Q`. The string `S` consists only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and has a length of `N` where `2 <= N <= 100000`. The integer `Q` represents the number of queries, where `1 <= Q <= 100000`. Each query consists of two integers, `l_i` and `r_i`, which satisfy the condition `1 <= l_i < r_i <= N`. The function processes these queries based on the given constraints.

The output of the function is determined by the specified queries. Each query can lead to different outputs based on the substring of `S` defined by the indices `l_i` and `r_i`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept the string `S` and process multiple queries to return results based on the specified ranges of the string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N, an integer N (2 <= N <= 100000), and an integer Q (1 <= Q <= 100000), and processes queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) to return results based on the specified substrings of S.**
