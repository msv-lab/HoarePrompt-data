The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of a loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will be executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, and `P[0]` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
