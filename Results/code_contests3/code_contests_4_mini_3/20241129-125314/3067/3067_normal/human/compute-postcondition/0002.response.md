`P` is assigned a list that contains `N + 1` zeros. The initial value of `N` is within the range 2 to 100000, which means `P` will be a list containing zeros with a length of `N + 1`. The other variables `Q` and `S` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000; `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `S` is a string from raw input; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000; `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `S` is a string from raw input; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.**
