`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `P[i - 1]` is also 0 (for any `i` from 1 to `N`). Therefore, `P[i]` will also be 0 after the assignment. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, and `P[i]` remains 0 as it is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, which is also 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `P[i]` remains 0.**
