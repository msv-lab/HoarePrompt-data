`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `P[i - 1]` is also 0. Therefore, after execution, `P[i]` becomes 0. The other variables `N`, `Q`, `S`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `P[i]` is 0.**
