`P[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `P` at index `0` is set to `0`, but it was already `0` since `P` is filled with zeros. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0.**
