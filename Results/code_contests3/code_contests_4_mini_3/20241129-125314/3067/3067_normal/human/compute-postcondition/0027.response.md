Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[i]` represents the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' from the start of the string up to index `i-1`. If 'AC' appears consecutively, `P[i]` will be incremented accordingly, otherwise it will retain the previous count.**
