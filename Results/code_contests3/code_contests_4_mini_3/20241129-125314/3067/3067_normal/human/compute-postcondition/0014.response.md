`P[0]` is assigned the value 0, but since it was already initialized to 0, it remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, and `P[0]` is 0.
