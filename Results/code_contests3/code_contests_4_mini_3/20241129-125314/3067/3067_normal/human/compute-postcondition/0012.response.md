Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros, and `i` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value `P[i - 1] + 1`, resulting in `P[i]` being 1. Otherwise, `P[i]` remains 0.***
