`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so we access `P[1]` and assign it the value of `P[0] + 1`. Since `P` is initially a list filled with zeros, `P[0]` is 0. Therefore, `P[1]` will be assigned the value `0 + 1`, which equals 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer within the range 2 to 100000, `Q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `S` is a string from raw input, `P` is a list with `P[0]` as 0 and `P[1]` as 1, and `i` is 1**.
