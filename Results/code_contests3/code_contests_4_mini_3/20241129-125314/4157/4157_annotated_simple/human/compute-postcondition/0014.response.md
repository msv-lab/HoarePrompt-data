To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ti` and `v` are assigned values from the input as floats. However, the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state and is essential for the calculation.
2. The code snippet uses a conditional expression to compute `t1`. It checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`. Depending on this condition, `t1` is assigned either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since the values of `d` and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `t1`. However, we can describe the output state based on the conditional logic.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 2; `ti` and `v` are assigned values from the input as floats; `t1` is dependent on the values of `d` and `a` as per the conditional expression.**
