According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Given that `t` is initialized to 0.0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, it is necessary that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t` is 0.0**
