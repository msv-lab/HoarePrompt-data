According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it will allow the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
