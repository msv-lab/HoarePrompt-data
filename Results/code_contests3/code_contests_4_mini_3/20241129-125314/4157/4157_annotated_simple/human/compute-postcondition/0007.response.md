According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, 0.0); the value of `t` is printed.**
