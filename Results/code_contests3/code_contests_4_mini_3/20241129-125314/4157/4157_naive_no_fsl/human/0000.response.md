Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the situation where trolleybuses catch up with each other correctly. Specifically, it calculates the time for each trolleybus to reach the final station without considering that if one trolleybus catches up to another, they must travel together at the speed of the slower trolleybus from that point onward.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 10 100
0 10
5 5
```

In this case:
- The first trolleybus leaves at `t=0` with a maximum speed of `10` m/s.
- The second trolleybus leaves at `t=5` with a maximum speed of `5` m/s.

The first trolleybus will reach the final station at `10` seconds (it accelerates to its max speed and reaches the final distance). The second trolleybus, however, will not be able to catch the first one, but it will reach a max speed of `5` m/s after leaving at `t=5`. It will take `20` seconds to reach the final station, arriving at `t=25`.

However, the program calculates each trolleybus's time independently and will output incorrect results in this case, failing to account for the catching up logic, thus making the program incorrect. 

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
