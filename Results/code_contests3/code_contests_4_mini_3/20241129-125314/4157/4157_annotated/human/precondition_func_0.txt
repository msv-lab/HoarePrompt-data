n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and each trolleybus has a departure time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and a maximum speed vi (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) such that the departure times are in strictly increasing order.
