The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned new values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split into separate components and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged at 0.0. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are not specified, so we cannot determine their new values after this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n`, `a`, and `d` are now assigned new input values, while `t` remains at its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), `t` is 0.0 and `n`, `a`, `d` are assigned new input values.**
