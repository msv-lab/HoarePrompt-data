Output State: **`t` is printed; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `ti` and `v` are assigned the values from `map(float, raw_input().split()); t1 is calculated based on the conditions involving `d`, `v`, and `a`; `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.**
