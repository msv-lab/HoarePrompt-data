Functionality: ** The function reads input values for the number of trolleybuses `n`, maximum acceleration `a`, and distance `d`. It then processes each trolleybus's departure time `ti` and maximum speed `vi` to calculate the time `t` it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on physics equations. The function prints the maximum time across all trolleybuses, considering their departure times and calculated travel times. The function does not directly accept parameters but relies on input values, which may lead to errors if the input format is incorrect or if `d` is less than the distance each trolleybus can travel based on its speed.**
