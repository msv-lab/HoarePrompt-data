The variable `t` is assigned the value of the maximum between `t1 + ti` and its previous value. The values of `ti` and `v` are float values from input, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d` and `a`. The output state reflects the new value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value.**
