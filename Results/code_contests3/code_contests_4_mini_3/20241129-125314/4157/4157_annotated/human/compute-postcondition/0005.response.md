The variable `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The previous values of `t1` and `ti` are not numerically defined due to the unknowns `d` and `a`, but we know that `ti` is a float value from input. The value of `t` will be updated based on the comparison of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.

Since `t1` is dependent on the condition involving `d` and `a`, which are unknown, we cannot determine a specific numerical output for `t1`. Therefore, we express the output state in relation to these variables.

Thus, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are float values from input, `t1` is assigned based on the condition involving `d` and `a`, and `t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value.**
