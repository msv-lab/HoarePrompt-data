According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. The loop variable `i` will take on values from `0` to `n-1`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop can execute at least once. The states of the variables `a`, `d`, and `t` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we need to establish the initial state of `i`.

Before the loop starts executing, the initial value of `i` should be set to `0` for the first iteration. Therefore, the key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initial value of `i` and the condition that `n` remains a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
