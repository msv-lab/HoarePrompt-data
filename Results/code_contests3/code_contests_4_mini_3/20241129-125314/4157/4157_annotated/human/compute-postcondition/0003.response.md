The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned the result of `map(float, raw_input().split())`, which means `raw_input()` accepts a space-separated input that is then split into components and converted to floats. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are assigned the float values from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are assigned the float values from input.**
