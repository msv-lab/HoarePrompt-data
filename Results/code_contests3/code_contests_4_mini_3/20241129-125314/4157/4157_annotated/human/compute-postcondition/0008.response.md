The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on the input received through `raw_input()`. Since `ti` and `v` are float values, they will hold the values entered by the user. The other variables (`t`, `t1`, `d`, `a`, `i`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value; `ti` and `v` are float values from input; `t1` is assigned based on the condition involving `d` and `a`; `i` is `k + 1`; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.
