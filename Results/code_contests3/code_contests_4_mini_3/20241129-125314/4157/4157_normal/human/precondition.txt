n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1,000,000), d is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 1,000,000); for each i-th trolleybus (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ti is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 1,000,000) representing the time it leaves the depot, and vi is a positive integer (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1,000,000) representing its maximum speed, with the constraint that the sequence of leaving times is strictly increasing (0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn).
