n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration (1 ≤ a ≤ 1,000,000), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 1,000,000), and for each trolleybus i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ti is a non-negative integer representing the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 1,000,000) and vi is a positive integer representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1,000,000) with the condition that the departure times are strictly increasing (0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn ≤ 1,000,000).
