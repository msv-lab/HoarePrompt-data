The code snippet assigns values to the variables `n`, `a`, and `d` based on user input, using the `map` function to convert the input values into integers. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are not specified since they are assigned from the input. Other variables (`t`, `ti`, and `vi`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `a`, and `d` are now assigned values from the input while `t` remains 0.0.

Output State: **`n`, `a`, `d` are input integers; `t` is 0.0**
