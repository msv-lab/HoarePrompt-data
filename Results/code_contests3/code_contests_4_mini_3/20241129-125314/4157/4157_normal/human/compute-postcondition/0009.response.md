To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The code calculates `t1` based on the values of `v`, `a`, and `d`.
2. The condition checks if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. 
3. If the condition is true, `t1` will be calculated using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
4. If the condition is false, `t1` will be calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t` is `max(t1 + ti, 0.0)`, we don't have specific values for `a`, `d`, `ti`, and `v`, but we know they will affect the calculation of `t1`.

After calculating `t1`, `t` will be determined as `max(t1 + ti, 0.0)`.

Thus, the output will summarize the updates in the state of the variables based on the calculations performed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `a` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `ti` is a float from input; `v` is a float from input; `t1` is calculated based on the formula involving `a`, `d`, and `v`; `t` is max(t1 + ti, 0.0)**
