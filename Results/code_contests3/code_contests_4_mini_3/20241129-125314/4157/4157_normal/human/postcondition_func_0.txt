The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `a`, a positive integer `d`, and a list of tuples (ti, vi) for each trolleybus, where `ti` is the departure time and `vi` is the maximum speed. It calculates and prints the time taken for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on their respective departure times and speeds using the provided physics equations. The function does not return any value; it only prints the computed times. The calculations consider the acceleration and the distance to determine the time for each trolleybus, taking into account the maximum speed and whether the distance allows for a straightforward acceleration to that speed.
