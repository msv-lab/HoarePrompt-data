Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd. This approach does not take into account the visitors' preferences and the beauty of the segments. As a result, the total beauty of the exhibition may not be maximized. 

An example where the program fails:
Input:
5 2
1 3
3 5

Expected Output:
01100

The expected output ensures that the total beauty is maximized, but the provided program does not guarantee this.
