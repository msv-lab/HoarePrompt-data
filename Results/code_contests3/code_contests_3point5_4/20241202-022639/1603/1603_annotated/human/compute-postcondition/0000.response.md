Example Answer: 
`n` and `m` are assigned values by mapping the input to integers. The `map` function takes the input from `raw_input().split()` and converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `m` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
