Example Answer:
The code prints '10' repeated n // 2 times, followed by '1' if n is an odd number. Therefore, depending on the value of n, the output will vary. If n is even, the output will be a string consisting of '10' repeated n // 2 times. If n is odd, the output will be a string consisting of '10' repeated (n // 2) times followed by '1'.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, Output string based on the value of `n`.**
