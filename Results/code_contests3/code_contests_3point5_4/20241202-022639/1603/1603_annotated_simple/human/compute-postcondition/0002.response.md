The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the predefined constraints for integers `n` and `m`. The function is expected to work with segments defined by `l_i` and `r_i`, each containing flowers within the range [1, n]. The function will perform some operations or calculations based on these constraints and relationships, but the exact details are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with segments containing flowers within the specified range and perform operations accordingly.
