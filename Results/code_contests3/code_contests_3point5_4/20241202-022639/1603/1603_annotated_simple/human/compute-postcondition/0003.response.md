Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then prints a string based on the calculation `(10 * (n // 2)) + ('1' if n is odd else '')`. The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on user input for `n` and `m`. It operates within the constraints of 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, and works with segments containing flowers within the range [1, n]. The function output is a string representing the calculated pattern based on the input `n`.**
