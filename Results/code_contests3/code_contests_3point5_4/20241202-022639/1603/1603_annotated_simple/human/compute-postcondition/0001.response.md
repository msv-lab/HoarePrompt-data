Example Answer:
The code prints a string composed of '10' repeated `(n // 2)` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `n`, the output state will depend on whether `n` is odd or even. If `n` is even, the output will be a string of '10' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd, the output will be a string of '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1'.
Output State: **Depends on the value of `n`, either a string of '10' repeated `n // 2` times or '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1'**
