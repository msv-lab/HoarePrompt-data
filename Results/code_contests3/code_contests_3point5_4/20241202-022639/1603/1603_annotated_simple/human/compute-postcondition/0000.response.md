Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are within the range [1, 10^3]. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
