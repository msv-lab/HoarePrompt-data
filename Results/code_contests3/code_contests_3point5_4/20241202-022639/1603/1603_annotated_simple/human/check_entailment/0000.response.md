Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The program does not consider the segments defined by the visitors and their impact on the beauty of the exhibition. The program simply prints a string of '10' repeated n//2 times, which does not optimize the beauty of the segments as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
