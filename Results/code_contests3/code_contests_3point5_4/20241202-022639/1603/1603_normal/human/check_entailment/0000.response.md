Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then constructs a string based on the values of `n`. It repeats '10' a number of times equal to half of `n`, and adds '1' at the end if `n` is odd. This logic aligns with the problem description of placing roses ('0's) and lilies ('1's) in the exhibition to maximize the beauty of segments visited by the visitors. The output generated by the code correctly represents the flower placements that Sonya can make to achieve the maximum total beauty as described in the problem. The code covers all potential cases and provides a valid output.
