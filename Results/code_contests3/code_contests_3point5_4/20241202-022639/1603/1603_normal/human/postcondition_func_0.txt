The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, then prints a string based on the values of `n` and whether it is odd or even. It constructs the string by repeating '10' a number of times equal to half of `n`, and adding '1' at the end if `n` is odd. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
