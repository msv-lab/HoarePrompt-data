Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values from the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes input and splits it based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each part to an integer. Since the initial state of `n` and `m` is not given, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3**
