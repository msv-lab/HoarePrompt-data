Example Answer:
The code snippet prints '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' if n is odd. Given that n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, the output will consist of '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, the output string consists of '10' repeated n//2 times, and '1' is appended if n is odd.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, the output string consists of '10' repeated n//2 times, and '1' is appended if n is odd**
