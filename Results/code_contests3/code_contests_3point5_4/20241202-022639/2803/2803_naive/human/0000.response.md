Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not consider the case where k is less than n. For example, if n = 4 and k = 2, the program will output 3 instead of the correct answer 6. This is because the program only checks if k - 1 is equal to 0, which does not cover all possible scenarios.
