Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values for n and k, then calculates the largest possible xor-sum based on the given conditions. The program calculates the xor-sum using bitwise operations and returns the correct result. It considers all possible combinations of candies that Grisha can take in order to maximize the xor-sum, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
