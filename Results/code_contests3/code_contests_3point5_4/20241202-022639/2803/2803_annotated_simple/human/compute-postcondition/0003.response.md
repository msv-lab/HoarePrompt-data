Functionality: The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. It then calculates and prints the result of 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n`, subtracted by 1 if `k - 1` is not equal to 0; otherwise, it prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
