Example Answer:
The code calculates 2 raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 1 if `k` is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns `n`. Since `n` and `k` are integers, the output will be an integer as well.
Output State: **The output will be an integer value based on the conditions mentioned in the code**
