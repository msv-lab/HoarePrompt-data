Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n` and `k` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**.
