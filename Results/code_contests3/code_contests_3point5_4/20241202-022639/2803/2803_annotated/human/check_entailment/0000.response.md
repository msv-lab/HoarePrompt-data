Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program does not handle the case where the candies are selected in a way to maximize the xor-sum, as described in the problem. Instead, it calculates 2 raised to the power of the binary length of `n` minus 1 if k - 1, which does not correspond to the problem requirements. Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for.
