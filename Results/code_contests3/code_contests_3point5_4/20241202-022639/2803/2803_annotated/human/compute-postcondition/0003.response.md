Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, then based on the value of `k`, it either calculates and prints 2 raised to the power of the binary length of `n` minus 1, or simply prints the value of `n`. The function does not handle the mathematical expression n choose k as described in the annotations. **
