The function `func` accepts no parameters. The function should return the result of the mathematical expression n choose k, where n and k are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the mathematical expression n choose k given the constraints on n and k.
