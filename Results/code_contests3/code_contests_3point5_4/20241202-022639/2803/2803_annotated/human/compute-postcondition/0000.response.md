Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, the values of `n` and `k` after execution are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
