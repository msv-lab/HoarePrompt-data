Functionality: **The function takes two integer inputs n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It then calculates and prints the value of nCk, where nCk represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k". The function utilizes bitwise operations to calculate the result, specifically returning 2 raised to the length of the binary representation of n minus 1 if k is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns n.**
