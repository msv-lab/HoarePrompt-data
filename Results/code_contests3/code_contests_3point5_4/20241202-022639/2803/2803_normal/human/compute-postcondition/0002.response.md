The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of nCk, which represents the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items. The parameters n and k are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the value of nCk for the given parameters n and k. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the value of nCk for the given parameters n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
