Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values for `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18**
