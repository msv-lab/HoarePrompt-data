Example Answer:
The code calculates the result based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is not equal to 1, it calculates `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, otherwise, it returns the value of `n`. Since the initial state specifies that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, the output state will depend on the values of `n` and `k`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `n` and `k`**
