Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes two integer inputs n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.
- It then calculates and prints the value of nCk, where nCk represents the binomial coefficient "n choose k".
- The code utilizes bitwise operations to calculate the result, specifically returning 2 raised to the length of the binary representation of n minus 1 if k is not equal to 1, otherwise it returns n.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. 
- The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code is implementing the intended functionality as described in the problem statement.
