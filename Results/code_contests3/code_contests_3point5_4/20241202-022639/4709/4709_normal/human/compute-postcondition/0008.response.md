According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of A and B. If the integer value of A is less than the integer value of B, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition for the loop to execute is that the integer value of A should be less than the integer value of B. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `int(A)` is less than `int(B)` for the loop to execute.

State: **A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is 1. If the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, then ans is updated to 1, for the loop to execute `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`**
