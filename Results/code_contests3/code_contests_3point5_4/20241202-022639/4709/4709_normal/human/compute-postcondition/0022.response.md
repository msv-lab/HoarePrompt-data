Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` outputs the value stored in the variable `ans`. The previous values of the variables `A`, `B`, and `ans` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is the count of numbers where the first and last digits are the same and the second and fourth digits are the same between the integers formed by A and B.
Output State: **A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is the count of numbers where the first and last digits are the same and the second and fourth digits are the same between the integers formed by A and B**
