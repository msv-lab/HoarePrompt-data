Example Answer:
B is assigned the value of the second element in list l. Since A is a substring from list l, the value of B is the element following A in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list.
Output State: **A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list**
