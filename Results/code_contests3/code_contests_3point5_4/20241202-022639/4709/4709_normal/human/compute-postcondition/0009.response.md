Output State: A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is 1. If the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, then ans is updated to 1, for the loop to execute `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. C is a list of characters obtained by converting the integer `i` to a string and then splitting it.
