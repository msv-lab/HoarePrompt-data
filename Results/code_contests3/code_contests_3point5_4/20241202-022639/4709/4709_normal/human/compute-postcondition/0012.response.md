Postcondition: ***Output State: A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is 2. If the integer value of A is equal to the integer value of B, then ans is updated to 2, for the loop to execute `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. C is a list of characters obtained by converting the integer `i` to a string and then splitting it. Additionally, after entering the if condition (C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]), the program state remains the same.***
