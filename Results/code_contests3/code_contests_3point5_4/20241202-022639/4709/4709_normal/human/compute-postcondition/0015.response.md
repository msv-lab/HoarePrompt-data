Output State: **A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is 3, for the loop to execute `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`, C is a list of characters obtained by converting the integer `i` to a string and then splitting it, after the if condition (C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]) the program state remains the same**
