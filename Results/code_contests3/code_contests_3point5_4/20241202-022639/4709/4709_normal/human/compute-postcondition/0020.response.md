Postcondition: ***A is a substring from the list l, B is the element following A in the list, ans is 4, for the loop to execute the next time int(A) is less than int(B), C is a list of characters obtained by converting the integer i+1 to a string and then splitting it. If C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3], then the program will execute the corresponding block of code.***
