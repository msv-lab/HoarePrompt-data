Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3 incremented to the integer value of `B`, `B` is a string of length 3, `ans` is either 0 or the total number of times the condition `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]` is satisfied within the range of integer values from `A` to `B`; The loop will execute if the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`; `C` is a list containing the characters of string `i` where `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3`**
