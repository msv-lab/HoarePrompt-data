Functionality: **The function `func` reads a 3x3 grid where each square contains a lowercase English letter. It then compares two integers A and B derived from user input, updates a variable `ans` based on a condition, and iterates through a range of integers between A and B to count occurrences that meet specific conditions. Finally, it prints the total count of occurrences that satisfy the condition. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
