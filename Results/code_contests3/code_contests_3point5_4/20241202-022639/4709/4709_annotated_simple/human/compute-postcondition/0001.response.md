Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of splitting the input `a` into a list. Since the input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` will be a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid**.
