Example Answer:
`A` is assigned the value of the first element of list `l`, which is a string of length 3. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3**
