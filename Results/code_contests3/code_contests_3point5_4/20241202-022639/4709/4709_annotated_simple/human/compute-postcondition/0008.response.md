According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute if the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `A` is less than `B` in terms of integer values. 
State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3, `B` is a string of length 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute, the integer value of `A` is less than the integer value of `B`.**
