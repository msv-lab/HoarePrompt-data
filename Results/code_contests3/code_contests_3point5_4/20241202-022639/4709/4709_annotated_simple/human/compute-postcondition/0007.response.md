Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3, `B` is a string of length 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
