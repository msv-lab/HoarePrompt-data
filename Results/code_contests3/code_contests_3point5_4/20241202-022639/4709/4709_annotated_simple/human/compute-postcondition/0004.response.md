Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected by the code snippet, the Output State is: `l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3, `B` is a string of length 3, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`l` is a list containing 3 elements, each element being a string of length 3 representing each row of the grid; `A` is a string of length 3, `B` is a string of length 3, `ans` is 0**
