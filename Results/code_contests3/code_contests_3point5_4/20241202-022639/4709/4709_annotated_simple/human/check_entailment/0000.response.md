Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem described. The program is trying to compare integer values of strings A and B, which are not necessarily integers but rather strings of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the program is using incorrect conditions and operations within the for loop to compare the characters in the grid.

The program does not extract the characters from the grid correctly nor does it concatenate the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
