Functionality: **The function `func` reads a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters as input, splits it into two strings A and B, and checks if the integer values of A and B are equal. If they are equal, it sets the variable `ans` to 1. Then, it iterates over a range from A to B (exclusive), converts each integer to a string, checks if the first and last digits are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal, and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
