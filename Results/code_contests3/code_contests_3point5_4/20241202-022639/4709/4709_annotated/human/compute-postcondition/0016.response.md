Postcondition: ***`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of 3 strings, `A` is assigned the value of the first string in list `l`, `B` is assigned the value of the second string in list `l`, `ans` is incremented by 1 only if the loop executes the first time the integer value of `B` is greater than the integer value of `A`, `C` is a list of strings where each element is a character of the integer `i` converted to string. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then the overall state is as described above.***
