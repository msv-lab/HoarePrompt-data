You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a 3Ã—3 square grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letters. The letter in the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is c_{ij}.

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Constraints

* Input consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}


Output

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Examples

Input

ant
obe
rec


Output

abc


Input

edu
cat
ion


Output

ean
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as c_{ij} where i and j are integers from 1 to 3.**
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of 3 strings, `A` is assigned the value of the first string in list `l`, `B` is assigned the value of the second string in list `l`, `ans` is 1. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of 3 strings, `A` is assigned the value of the first string in list `l`, `B` is assigned the value of the second string in list `l`, `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]` is true where `i` ranges from `int(A)` to `int(B)` (exclusive), `C` is a list of strings where each element is a character of the integer `i` converted to string.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters as input, splits it into two strings A and B, and checks if the integer values of A and B are equal. If they are equal, it sets the variable `ans` to 1. Then, it iterates over a range from A to B (exclusive), converts each integer to a string, checks if the first and last digits are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal, and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
