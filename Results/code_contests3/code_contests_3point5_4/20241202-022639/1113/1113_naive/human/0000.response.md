Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to change at most 9 elements of the correct sudoku solution to make it an anti-sudoku. The program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, which does not guarantee that the resulting grid will be an anti-sudoku. To create an anti-sudoku, we need to ensure that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements, which the program does not consider. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
