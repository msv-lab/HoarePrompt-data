According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `nRow` is an empty string do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is the input value stripped and not empty, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first element in `row`**
