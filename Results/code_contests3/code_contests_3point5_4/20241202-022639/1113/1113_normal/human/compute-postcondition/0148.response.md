According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` should contain the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` and `i` should be the last character iterated over. So for the loop to be executed, `row` must not be empty, `nRow` should be updated with the final value, and `i` should be the last character iterated over.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over, `row` is not empty, `i` is the last character iterated over in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `nRow` is updated with the final value obtained after replacing '9' with '1' in `row`.**
