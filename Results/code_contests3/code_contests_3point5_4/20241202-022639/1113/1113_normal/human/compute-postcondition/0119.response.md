Example Answer:
The code appends '1' to the `nRow` string. The value of `nRow` is updated based on the existing content, where '9' gets replaced with '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration with characters left to iterate over, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration with characters left to iterate over, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9'**
