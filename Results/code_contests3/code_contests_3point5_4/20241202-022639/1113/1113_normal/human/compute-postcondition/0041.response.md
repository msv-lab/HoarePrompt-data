Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have the updated value based on the append operation. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value with the next element ready for processing, and `nRow` is updated with the appended '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value with the next element ready for processing, `nRow` is updated with the appended '1'**
