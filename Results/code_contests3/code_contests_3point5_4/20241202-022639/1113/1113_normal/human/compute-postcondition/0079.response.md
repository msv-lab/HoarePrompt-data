Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the updated value based on the condition, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', then some specific action takes place. Otherwise, a different action occurs based on the value of `i`.***
