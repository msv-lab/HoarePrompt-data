Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. This means any leading or trailing whitespaces are removed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value.
