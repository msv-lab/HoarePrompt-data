According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` being positive infinity and `res` containing the appended value of the updated `nRow` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9', for the loop to execute the first time `row` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `row`**
