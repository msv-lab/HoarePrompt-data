Output State: **maxint is positive infinity, res contains the final appended values of all nRow from each iteration, row contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, nRow contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in row, t is the next iteration number, T is greater than the new t value, nRow is a string with '1' if i is '9', otherwise nRow is '9'. The loop will iterate through each character in row, replacing '9' with '1' and keeping other characters as they are.**
