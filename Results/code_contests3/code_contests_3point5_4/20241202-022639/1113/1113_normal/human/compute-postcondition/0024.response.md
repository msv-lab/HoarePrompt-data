Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` still contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1' if the next element in `row` after `i` is '9', or the concatenation of the next element if it is not '9', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i`.***
