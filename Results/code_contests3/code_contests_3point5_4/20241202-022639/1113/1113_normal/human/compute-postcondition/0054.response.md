Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of the first character in `row` and `i` is the first character in `row` but not equal to '9'.***
