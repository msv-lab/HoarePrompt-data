Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous state of `nRow` is unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value with the next element ready for processing, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value with the next element ready for processing, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`**
