Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so if the previous value of `nRow` was '111', after execution it will become '1111'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over, `row` is not empty, `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration.
