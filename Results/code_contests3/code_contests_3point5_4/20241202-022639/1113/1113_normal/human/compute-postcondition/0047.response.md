Example Answer: 
The `row` variable is assigned the stripped input value. The `strip()` function removes any leading and trailing whitespaces from the input. The other variables `maxint`, `res`, and `nRow` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'**
