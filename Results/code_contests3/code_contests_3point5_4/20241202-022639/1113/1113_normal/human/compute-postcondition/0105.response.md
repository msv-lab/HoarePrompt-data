According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the new values should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9', for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9.**
