Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so the updated `nRow` is '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` is '1', `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `i` is the next character in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` is '1', `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `i` is the next character in `row`**
