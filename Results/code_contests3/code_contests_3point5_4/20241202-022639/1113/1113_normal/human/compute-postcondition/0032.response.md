Example Answer:
The value '1' is appended to the variable `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so the new value of `nRow` is '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first element in `row` which is '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
