According to the code, the loop will execute 9 times as specified by the range(9). At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'**
