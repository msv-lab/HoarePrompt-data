According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is the last character iterated over in `row`, so it needs to be adjusted to the first character in `row`. Also, since `nRow` is determined by the characters in `row`, it should be updated based on the characters in the new `row`. 
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row`, `row` is not empty, `i` is the first character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `i` is 9**.
