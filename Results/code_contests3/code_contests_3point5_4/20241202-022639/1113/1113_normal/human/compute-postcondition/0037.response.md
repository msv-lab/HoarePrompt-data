Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Since the previous state of `nRow` is unknown, the updated `nRow` will be the concatenation of the previous `nRow` with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9', for the loop to execute one more time `row` is not empty and the next element after `i` is considered for appending to `nRow`.
