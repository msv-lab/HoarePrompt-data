Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The content of `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in the original `row`, and the original elements for each element that is not '9'. Based on the initial state, `maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `nRow` are not affected by this statement directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'**
