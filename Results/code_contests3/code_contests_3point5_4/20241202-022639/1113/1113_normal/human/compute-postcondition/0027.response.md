According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 9 times, as determined by the range(9) statement. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `maxint` is positive infinity
- `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`
- `row` contains all elements processed during the loop
- `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `maxint` remains positive infinity
- `res` will be updated based on the new `nRow` value after the next iteration
- `row` will be updated with the elements processed during the next iteration
- `nRow` will be updated based on the concatenation of elements in the new `row` after processing

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains all elements processed during the next iteration, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'**
