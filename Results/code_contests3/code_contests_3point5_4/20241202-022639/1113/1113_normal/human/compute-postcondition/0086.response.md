According to the code, the loop iterates over a range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value. Since the loop iterates over a range of 9, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next iteration will have `i` as 9.
