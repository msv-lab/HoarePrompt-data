Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will be updated with the appended value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, the next character in `row` is ready to be processed.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, the next character in `row` is ready to be processed**
