Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, the next character in `row` is ready to be processed.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, the next character in `row` is ready to be processed**
