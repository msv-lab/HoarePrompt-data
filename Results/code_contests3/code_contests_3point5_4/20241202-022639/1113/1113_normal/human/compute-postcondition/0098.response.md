Postcondition: ***maxint is positive infinity, res contains the final appended values of all nRow from each iteration, row contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, nRow contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in row, t is the next iteration number, T is greater than the new t value, nRow is a string with '1' if i is '9', otherwise nRow is '9', for the loop to execute one more time row is not empty and i is either '9' or not equal to '9'. In the if part, nRow is appended with '1'. In the else part, nRow is appended with the value of i.***
