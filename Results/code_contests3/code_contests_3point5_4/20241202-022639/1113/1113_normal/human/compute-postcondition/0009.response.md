Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of `maxint` and `res` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is the input value stripped.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is the input value stripped**
