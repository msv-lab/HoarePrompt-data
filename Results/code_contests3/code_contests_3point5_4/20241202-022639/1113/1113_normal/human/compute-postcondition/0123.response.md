Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The content of `res` now contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over and `row` is empty.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over and `row` is empty**
