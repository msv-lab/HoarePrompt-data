According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `row` needs to be updated, and `nRow` needs to be updated based on the new `row` value after replacing '9' with '1'.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over, `row` is not empty, `i` is the next character in `row` after the last iteration is the next character to be iterated over.**
