Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration with characters left to iterate over, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9'. In the if part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. In the else part, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`***
