Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the updated value based on the condition, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `i` is the next character in `row`.
