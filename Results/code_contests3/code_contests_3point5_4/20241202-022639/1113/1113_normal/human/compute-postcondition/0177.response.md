According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row`, `i`, and `nRow`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row` concatenated with the current value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must not be empty, `i` must be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` must contain the last character iterated over in the new `row` concatenated with the current value of `i`.
State: **Output State: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` is the concatenation of the last character iterated over in the new `row` and the current value of `i`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '11' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row` concatenated with the current value of `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is assigned the stripped input value.**
