According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1' if the next element in `row` after `i` is '9', or the concatenation of the next element if it is not '9', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is concatenated with `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `row` must still contain more elements.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` still contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1' if the next element in `row` after `i` is '9', or the concatenation of the next element if it is not '9', `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is concatenated with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.**
