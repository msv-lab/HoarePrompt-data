Example Answer: 
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The initial state of `res` is an empty list, and the initial state of `nRow` is defined based on the elements in `row`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` is appended to `res`. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of `nRow`, `row` contains all elements processed during the loop, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'**
