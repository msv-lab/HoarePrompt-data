Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9', and for the loop to execute one more time `row` is not empty and the next element after `i` is considered for appending to `nRow`. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9' with the value of `i`.**
