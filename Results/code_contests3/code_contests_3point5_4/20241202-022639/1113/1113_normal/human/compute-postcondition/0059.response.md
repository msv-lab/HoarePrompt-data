According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `row` to be processed. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, and the next character in `row` is ready to be processed regardless of whether `i` is equal to '9' or not. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `row` needs to be processed, so the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, and the next character in `row` is ready to be processed**.
