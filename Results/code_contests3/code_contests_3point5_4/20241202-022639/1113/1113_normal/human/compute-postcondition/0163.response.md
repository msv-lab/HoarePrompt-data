Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: maxint is positive infinity, res contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, row contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, nRow contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in row, t is the next iteration number, T is greater than the new t value, nRow is a string with '1' if all characters in row are '9', otherwise nRow contains the last character iterated over, row is not empty, i is the last character iterated over in row, row is assigned the stripped input value.
