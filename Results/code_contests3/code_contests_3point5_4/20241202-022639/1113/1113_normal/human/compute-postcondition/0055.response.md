According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', the loop stops. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the value of the first character in `row` and `i` is the first character in `row` but not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must not be empty and the next character in `row` must be processed.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, the next character in `row` is ready to be processed**
