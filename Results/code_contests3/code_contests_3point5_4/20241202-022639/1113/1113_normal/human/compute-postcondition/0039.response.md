Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'. If `i` is equal to '9', then the value of `nRow` is updated with '1'. Otherwise, the value of `nRow` remains the same as before the if else block.***
