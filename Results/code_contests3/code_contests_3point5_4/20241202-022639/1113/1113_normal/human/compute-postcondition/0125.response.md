According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the current iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value. So for the loop to execute one more time, the new `t` value should be incremented by 1.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over and `row` is empty**.
