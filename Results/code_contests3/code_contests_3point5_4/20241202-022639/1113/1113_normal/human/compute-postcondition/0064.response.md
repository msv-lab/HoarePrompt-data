Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The value of `nRow` is obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`. The variables `maxint` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated appended value of `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated appended value of `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`**
