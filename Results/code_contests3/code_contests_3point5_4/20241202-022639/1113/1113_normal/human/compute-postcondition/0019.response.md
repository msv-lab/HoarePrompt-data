Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, where `i` is the next element in `row`. The value of `nRow` can either be '1i' if the next element after `i` is '9', or it can be the concatenation of the next element with `i`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1i' or the concatenation of the next element with `i`, `i` is the next element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1i' or the concatenation of the next element with `i`, `i` is the next element in `row`**
