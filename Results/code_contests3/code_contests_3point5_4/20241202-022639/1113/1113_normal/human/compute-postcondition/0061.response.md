Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, and the next character in `row` is ready to be processed.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, and the next character in `row` is ready to be processed**
