According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Also, the variable `i` will be the first character in `row`. 
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty, `i` is the first character in `row`**
