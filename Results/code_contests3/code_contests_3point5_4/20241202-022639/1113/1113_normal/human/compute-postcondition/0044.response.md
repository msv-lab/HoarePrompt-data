Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9'. The final value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of '1' for each '9' in the original `row`, and the original elements for each element that is not '9'.**
