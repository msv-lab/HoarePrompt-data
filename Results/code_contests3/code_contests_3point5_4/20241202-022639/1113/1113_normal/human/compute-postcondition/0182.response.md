Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to `res`, which contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` is a string with '11' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row` concatenated with the current value of `i`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `row` is not empty, `i` is the last character iterated over in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` is a string with '11' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over in the new `row` concatenated with the current value of `i`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `row` is not empty, `i` is the last character iterated over in `row`.**
