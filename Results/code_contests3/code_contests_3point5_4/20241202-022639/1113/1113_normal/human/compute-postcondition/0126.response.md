According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range is fixed from 0 to 8. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` is a string with '1' if all characters in `row` are '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the last character iterated over and `row` is empty, `i` is 0 for the first iteration.**
