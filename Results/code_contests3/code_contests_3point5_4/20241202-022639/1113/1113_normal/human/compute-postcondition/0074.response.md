Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `nRow` in each iteration. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character in `row`, which is not '9', the value of `i` will be appended to `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `nRow` contains the appended `i`, `row` is not empty, `i` is the first character in `row`, and the first character in `row` is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the appended `i`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, `i` is the first character in `row`, and the first character in `row` is not '9'**
