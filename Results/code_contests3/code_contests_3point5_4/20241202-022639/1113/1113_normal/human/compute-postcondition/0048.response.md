Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The values of other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string**
