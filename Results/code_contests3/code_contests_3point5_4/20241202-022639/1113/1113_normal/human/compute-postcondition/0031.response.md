Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' for each element in the updated `row` that is '9', or the concatenation of the element itself if it is not '9', for the loop to execute the first time `row` is not empty and `i` is the first element in `row`. Additionally, `i` is equal to '9'***
