Example Answer: 
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be called when the program exits. This lambda function writes the output stored in `sys.stdout.getvalue()` to the standard output. The grid values are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.**
