Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. Since the previous `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', the new `nRow` will have an additional '1' at the end. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration with the latest appended `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value from the final iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the next iteration number, `T` is greater than the new `t` value, and `nRow` is a string with '1' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is '9', `row` is not empty, and there are still characters left in `row` to iterate over.
