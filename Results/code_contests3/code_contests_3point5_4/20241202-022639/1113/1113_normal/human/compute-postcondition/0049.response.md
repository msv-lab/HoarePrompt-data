According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` being positive infinity does not affect the loop execution. The state needs to be adjusted so that `row` is not empty and `i` is the first character in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in `row`**
