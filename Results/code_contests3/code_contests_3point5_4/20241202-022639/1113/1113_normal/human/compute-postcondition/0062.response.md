Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the appended value of the updated `nRow`, `row` contains the stripped input value which is not empty, and the next character in `row` is ready to be processed. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, the program continues without appending anything to `nRow`.***
