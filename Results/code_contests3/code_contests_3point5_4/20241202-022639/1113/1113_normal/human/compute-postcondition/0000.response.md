Example Answer:
The code snippet `sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()` redirects the standard output to a BytesIO object. This means that any print statements or output generated by the program will be stored in the BytesIO object instead of being displayed on the console. The initial state of the 9x9 grid is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.**
