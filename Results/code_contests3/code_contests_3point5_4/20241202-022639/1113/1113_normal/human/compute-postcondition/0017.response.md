According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements left in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is the input value stripped and not empty, `nRow` is either '1' if the first element in `row` is '9', or the concatenation of `i` if the first element in `row` is not '9', `i` is the first element in `row`. 

To adjust for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `row` should be considered. So the state should be updated as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` contains more elements, `nRow` is either '1' if the next element in `row` after `i` is '9', or the concatenation of the next element if it is not '9', `i` is the next element in `row`**
