    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the final appended values of all `nRow` from each iteration, `row` is the input value from the last iteration, `nRow` contains the final value obtained after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `t` is the last iteration number, `T` is equal to the final `t` value, `i` is the last character iterated over in `row`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9. The function replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the grid and prints the modified grid. The function does not explicitly return any value.
