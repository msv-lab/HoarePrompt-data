Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes in a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9. It then replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the grid and prints the modified grid. This transformation ensures that each row contains at least two equal elements, thereby making the field an anti-sudoku. The code follows the problem description for every potential case as it correctly modifies the grid to meet the anti-sudoku requirements. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
