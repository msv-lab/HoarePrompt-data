Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1'. Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will contain '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is '1', for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. The last value of `row` is equal to '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is '1', for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. The last value of `row` is equal to '9'**
