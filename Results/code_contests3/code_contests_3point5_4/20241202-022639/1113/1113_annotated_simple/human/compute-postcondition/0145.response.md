According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, the `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 9, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 10, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`**.
