According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `row` should not be empty, and `i` should be the first element of `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is not empty, `i` is equal to the first element of `row`.**
