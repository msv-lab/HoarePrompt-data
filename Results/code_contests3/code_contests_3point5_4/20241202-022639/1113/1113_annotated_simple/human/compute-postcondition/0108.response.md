According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row`. The loop iterates over each element in `row`. In order for the loop to execute, the `row` must contain at least one element. 
Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute `row` must contain at least one element**
