Example Answer:
`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the variables are: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping. After the execution, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping, `nRow` is an empty string.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping, `nRow` is an empty string**
