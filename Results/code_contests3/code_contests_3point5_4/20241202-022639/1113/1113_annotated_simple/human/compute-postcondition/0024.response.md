Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty) with more elements, `nRow` is either '1' or '11' if `i` is '9'. The loop can continue based on the values of `i` and `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly.***
