Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated by adding '1'. Otherwise, the program continues with the existing values of the variables.***
