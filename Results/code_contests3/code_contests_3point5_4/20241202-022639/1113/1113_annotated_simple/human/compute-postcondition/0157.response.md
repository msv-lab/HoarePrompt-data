Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 10, `row` contains the stripped input value and is not empty, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` is an empty string with the next element from `row` to be processed in the next iteration of the loop. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by 10.***
