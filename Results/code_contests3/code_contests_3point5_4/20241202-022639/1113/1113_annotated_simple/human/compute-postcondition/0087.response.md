Example Answer: 
The input is stripped and stored in the variable `row`. The modified `row` is stored in `nRow` by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'. The total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row` is added to the current value of `t`. The last value of `row` is stored in `i`, and the updated `nRow` is stored in `res`. The `maxint` value remains positive infinity. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`**
