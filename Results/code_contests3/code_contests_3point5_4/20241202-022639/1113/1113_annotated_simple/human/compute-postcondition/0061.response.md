Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state determine the value of `nRow` based on the values of `i` and the last value of `row`. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations. If the last value of `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1' for the loop to execute one more time. If the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated based on the conditions. Otherwise, if the last value of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is updated to '10' and if the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated based on the conditions.
