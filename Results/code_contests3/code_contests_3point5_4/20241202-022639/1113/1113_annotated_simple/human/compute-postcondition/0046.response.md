According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since the loop iterates from 0 to 8 inclusive, the loop will execute one more time when `i` is 8. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 8 (last value of `row` after all iterations), `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations. If '9' is present in `row`, it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise, the value of `i` is directly added to `nRow`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 9, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations**
