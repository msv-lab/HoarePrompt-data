Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, where the value of `i` is unknown. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time**
