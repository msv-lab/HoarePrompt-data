Example Answer:
`nRow` concatenates the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so after the code execution, `nRow` will have '1' appended to it. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T` and has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and `nRow` has '1' appended to it.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T` and has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `nRow` has '1' appended to it**
