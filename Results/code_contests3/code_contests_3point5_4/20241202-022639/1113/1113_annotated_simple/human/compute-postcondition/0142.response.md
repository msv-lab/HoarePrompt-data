Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T` and has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has '1' appended to it. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is modified by adding 1 to its previous value.***
