According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as it iterates over the range(9). At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object with all elements processed, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`. Since the loop is going to execute one more time, the value of `i` will be 9 after the next iteration.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an iterable object with all elements processed, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`**
