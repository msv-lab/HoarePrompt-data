Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated based on the last element in `row`, `row` has no more elements to be processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the stripped input. If the value of `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is appended with '1'. If the value of `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
