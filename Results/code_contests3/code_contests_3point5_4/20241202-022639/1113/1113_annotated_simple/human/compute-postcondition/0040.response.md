According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is still within the conditions mentioned and there are more values in `row` to iterate through, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, and `row` contains the updated stripped input value. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time**
