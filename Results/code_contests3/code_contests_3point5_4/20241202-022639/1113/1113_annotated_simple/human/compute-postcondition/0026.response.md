Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The initial state indicates that `res` is an empty list, and `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`. Since `row` is an iterable object with all elements processed and `nRow` constructed based on those elements, the new state after appending `nRow` to `res` is that `res` contains `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object with all elements processed, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object with all elements processed, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`**
