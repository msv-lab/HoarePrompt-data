Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is '1' if the last value of `row` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated with the value of `i`. For the loop to execute, `row` is not empty and the value of `i` is not equal to '9'.***
