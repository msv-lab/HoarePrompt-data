Example Answer:
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be executed at exit. It doesn't directly affect the values in the 9x9 grid. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, which is a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.
Output State: **Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a digit from 1 to 9.**
