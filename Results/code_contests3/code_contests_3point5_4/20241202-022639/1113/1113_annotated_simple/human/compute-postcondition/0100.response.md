Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for the last element in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, for the loop to execute the second time `row` must have a length greater than the current value of `i`, `nRow` is appended with '1'.**
