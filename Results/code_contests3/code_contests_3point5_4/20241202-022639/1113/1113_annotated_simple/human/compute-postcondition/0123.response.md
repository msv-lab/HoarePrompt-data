Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, `i` is the last element in `row`.
