Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity. `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value. For the loop to execute the first time, `row` is not empty and `i` is equal to the first element of `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '1' and `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
