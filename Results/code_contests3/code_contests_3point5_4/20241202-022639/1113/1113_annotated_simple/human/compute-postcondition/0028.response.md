Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of `maxint`, `res`, `i`, and `nRow` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` is constructed based on the conditions in the loop for each element in `row`**
