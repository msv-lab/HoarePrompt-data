Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the updated `nRow` will be the previous value concatenated with '1'. As `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `res` will also be updated with the new value of `nRow`. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time**
