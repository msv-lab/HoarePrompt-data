According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `row` is not empty and `i` is equal to the first element of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value. For the loop to execute the first time, `row` is not empty and `i` is equal to the first element of `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '1' and `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'. 
So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and `row` contains the updated stripped input value.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity. `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time**
