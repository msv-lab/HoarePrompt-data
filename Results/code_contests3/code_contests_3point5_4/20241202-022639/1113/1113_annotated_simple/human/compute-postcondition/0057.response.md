Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The value of `nRow` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. If the last value of `row` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '10' (1 + 9), otherwise, it is updated to the value of `i` for further execution. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is '10' if the last value of `row` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated with the value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time and `row` should not be empty and the value of `i` is not equal to '9'**
