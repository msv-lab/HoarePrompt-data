Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have '1' added to it. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has elements to be processed, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has elements to be processed, `nRow` is updated with '1'**
