Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are known. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the modified value after adding `i`. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `row`, `T`, `t` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by 1.**
