Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to `nRow`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will contain the updated result. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` has at least 1 more element to be processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the stripped input, and `nRow` has been updated by adding `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` has at least 1 more element to be processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the stripped input, `nRow` has been updated by adding `i`**
