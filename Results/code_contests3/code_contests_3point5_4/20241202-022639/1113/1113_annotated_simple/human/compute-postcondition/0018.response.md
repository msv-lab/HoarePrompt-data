Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so if `nRow` was '1', it will become '11'. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty), `nRow` is either '1' or '11'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty), `nRow` is either '1' or '11'**
