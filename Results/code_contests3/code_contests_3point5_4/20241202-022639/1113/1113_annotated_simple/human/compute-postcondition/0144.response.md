Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` contains the final string after replacing all '9's with '1's for all elements in `T`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the length of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` contains the final string after replacing all '9's with '1's for all elements in `T`.**
