Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variables `maxint`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping**
