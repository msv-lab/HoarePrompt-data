Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, and `i` is 1. So, `nRow` is modified by adding 1 to its previous value. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T` and has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `nRow` is modified by adding 1 to its previous value.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T` and has been incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `nRow` is modified by adding 1 to its previous value**
