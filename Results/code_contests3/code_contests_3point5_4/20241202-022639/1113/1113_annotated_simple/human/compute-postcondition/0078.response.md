Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, where `i` is the last value of `row`. The value of `nRow` is modified by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by 1**
