According to the code, the loop executes for a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`**.
