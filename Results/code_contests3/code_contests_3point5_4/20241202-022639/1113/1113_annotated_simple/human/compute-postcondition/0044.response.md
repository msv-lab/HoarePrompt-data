Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row` after all iterations, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations. If '9' is present in `row`, it is replaced with '1' in `nRow`, otherwise, the value of `i` is directly added to `nRow`.**
