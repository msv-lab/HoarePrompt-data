Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated for each iteration, `i` is incremented for each iteration. If the value of `i` is equal to '9', then no changes are made. Otherwise, `i` is incremented and updated accordingly.***
