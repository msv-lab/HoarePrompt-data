According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` will contain the modified `nRow`. So for the loop to be executed, `row` must not be empty and `i` is set to the last value of `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
