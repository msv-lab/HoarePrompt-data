Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has elements to be processed, `nRow` is updated either with '1' if `i` equals '9' or based on the next element in `row` if `i` is not equal to '9'***
