Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the stripped input value using `input()`. The previous values of the other variables are `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T`**
