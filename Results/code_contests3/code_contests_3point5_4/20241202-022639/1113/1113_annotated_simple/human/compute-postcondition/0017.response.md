According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `row`, and `nRow`. If `i` is still within the range of elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty). If `i` == '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the index of the first element in `row` and `i` is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `row`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty), `nRow` is either '1' or the index of the next element in `row`**
