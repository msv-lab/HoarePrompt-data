Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res`, meaning the modified `nRow` is added to the list `res`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations of the loop, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` has been fully processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`.
