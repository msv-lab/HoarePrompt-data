Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` is incremented by 1, `nRow` now contains an additional '1' at the end**
