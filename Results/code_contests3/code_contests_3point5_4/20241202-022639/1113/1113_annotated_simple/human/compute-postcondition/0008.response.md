According to the code, the loop will always execute 9 times because the range is explicitly set to `range(9)`. Therefore, the `T` value is not relevant for the loop execution. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
