Example Answer: 
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so the new value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of the previous value of `nRow` with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'**
