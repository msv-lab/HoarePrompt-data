According to the code, the loop will execute T number of times, where T is an input integer. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity and `res` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, T must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, and `T` is a positive integer.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer for the loop to execute T times**
