According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `row` is not empty.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 10, `row` contains the stripped input value and is not empty, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` is an empty string**
