Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to '9', then the program state remains the same. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
