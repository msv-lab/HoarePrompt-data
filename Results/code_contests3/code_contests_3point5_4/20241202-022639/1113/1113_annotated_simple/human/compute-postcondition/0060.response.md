Example Answer:
After executing the code `nRow += '1'`, the value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The exact value of `nRow` depends on the previous state of the variable which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations. If the last value of `row` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '1' for the loop to execute one more time. If the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated based on the conditions. Otherwise, if the last value of `row` is not '9', `nRow` is updated to '10' and if the value of `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated based on the conditions.
