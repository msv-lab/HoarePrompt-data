Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact increment cannot be calculated. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, `i` is the next element in `row`, for the loop to execute `row` must contain at least one more element. If the next element is '9', `nRow` should be appended with the character '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` should be increased by 9.
