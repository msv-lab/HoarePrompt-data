Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has elements to be processed, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` still has elements to be processed, `nRow` is updated based on the next element in `row`**
