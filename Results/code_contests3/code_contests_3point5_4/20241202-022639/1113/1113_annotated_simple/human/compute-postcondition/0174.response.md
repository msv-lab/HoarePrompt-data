Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1'. The `nRow` already contains the modified `nRow`, so after execution, `nRow` will have '1' added to the end. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` has at least 1 more element to be processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the stripped input and `nRow` is appended with '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the next element in `row`, `row` has at least 1 more element to be processed, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`, `row` contains the stripped input and `nRow` is appended with '1'**
