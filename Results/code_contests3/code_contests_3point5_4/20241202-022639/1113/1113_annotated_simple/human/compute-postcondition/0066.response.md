According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row` after all iterations, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1.
