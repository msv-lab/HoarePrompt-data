Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` is appended to the list `res`. The loop iterates for each character in `row` and updates `nRow` accordingly. The initial state of `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row`**
