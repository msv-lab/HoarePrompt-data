Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the stripped input value using the `strip()` function. The value of `row` is obtained from user input and then stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 10, `row` contains the stripped input value, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`.
