Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the first value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for the first element in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` has at least one element. If the value of `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. If the value of `i` is not '9', `i` gets appended to `nRow`.***
