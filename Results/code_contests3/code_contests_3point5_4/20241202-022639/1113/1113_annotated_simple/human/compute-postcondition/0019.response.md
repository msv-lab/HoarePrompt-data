Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, where `i` is the next element in `row`. The initial state of `nRow` is either '1' or the index of the next element in `row`, and `i` is also the next element in `row`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` is an iterable object (non-empty), `nRow` is updated based on the previous values.**
