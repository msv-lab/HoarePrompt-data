Example Answer:
The code snippet writes each element in `res` separated by a new line. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations of the loop, `i` is the last element in `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is equal to `T`. The elements in `res` are joined by a new line.
