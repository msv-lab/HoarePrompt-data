Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty. The last value of `row` is equal to '9'***
