Example Answer:
The code takes an input and strips any leading or trailing whitespaces from it, then assigns the stripped input to the variable `row`. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `i`, `nRow`, and `t` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row` after all iterations, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, for the loop to execute one more time `t` is incremented by 1.
