Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for the last element in `T`, `t` is incremented by the total number of occurrences of '9' in the original input `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` has at least one element. If the value of the last element in `row` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. If the value of the last element in `row` is not '9', the last element in `row` gets appended to `nRow`. To execute the loop again, the length of `row` must be greater than the current value of `i`. Additionally, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
