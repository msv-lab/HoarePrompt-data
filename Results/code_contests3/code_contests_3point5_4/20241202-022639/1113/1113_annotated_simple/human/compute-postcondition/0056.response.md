Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its current value. The value of `nRow` depends on the last value of `row` and `i`. If the last value of `row` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '1', otherwise, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. `row` should not be empty and the value of `i` should not be equal to '9'. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow`, `i` is the last value of `row`, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` is updated based on the conditions**
