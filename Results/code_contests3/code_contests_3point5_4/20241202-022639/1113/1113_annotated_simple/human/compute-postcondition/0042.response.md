Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the updated `nRow`, `i` is updated based on the conditions, `row` contains the updated stripped input value for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
