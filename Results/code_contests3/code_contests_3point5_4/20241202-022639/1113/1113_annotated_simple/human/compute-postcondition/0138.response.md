Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the modified `nRow` after all iterations, `i` is 1, `row` contains the modified stripped input value after all iterations, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the original input `row` for all elements in `T`, `t` is less than `T`, `nRow` is updated for each iteration. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, '1' is added for each iteration.***
