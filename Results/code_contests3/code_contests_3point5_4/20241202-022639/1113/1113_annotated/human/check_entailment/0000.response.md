Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program is supposed to change at most 9 elements in the correct sudoku solution to create an anti-sudoku solution. However, the provided program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku solution, which does not create an anti-sudoku solution.

The program does not implement the logic required to transform a correct sudoku solution into an anti-sudoku solution. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
