The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9. Within the nested loops, it replaces every occurrence of '9' in a row with '1' and appends the modified row to a list `res`. After processing all rows, it concatenates the modified rows with newline characters and writes the result to standard output. The function does not explicitly return any value.
