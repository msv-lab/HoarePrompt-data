Example Answer: 
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, but the initial values of `nRow` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is incremented, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in `row`.
