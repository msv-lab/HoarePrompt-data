Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains the updated result. If `i` is equal to '9', an additional '1' is added to `nRow`. Regardless of the if condition, `res` contains 10 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, and for the loop to execute again, `row` must not be empty.***
