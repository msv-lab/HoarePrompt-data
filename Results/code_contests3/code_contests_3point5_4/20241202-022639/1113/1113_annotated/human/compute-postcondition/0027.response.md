According to the code, the loop can execute 10 times (0 to 9) based on the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged. To execute one more time, the loop needs to increment the value of `i` by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 9.
State: **At the end of the loop, `nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged, `i` is 9**
