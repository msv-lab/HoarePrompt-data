Example Answer:
If the next `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If the next `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of the next `i` is concatenated at the end of `nRow`. Therefore, after the execution of the code snippet, '1' will be added at the end of `nRow`.
Output State: **`nRow` has '1' added at the end**
