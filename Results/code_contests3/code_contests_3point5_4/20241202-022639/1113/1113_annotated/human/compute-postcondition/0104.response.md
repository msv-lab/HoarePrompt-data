Example Answer:
`res` appends the value of `nRow`, adding a copy of `nRow` to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the concatenated values of all `i` where '9' is replaced by '1', `res` contains 11 copies of the final `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is not empty and contains the stripped input value.
