Postcondition: ***The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `nRow` is concatenated with '1' if `i` is equal to '9', otherwise `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more elements in `row`.***
