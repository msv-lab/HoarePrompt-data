Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The values of `nRow` and `res` are not affected. The loop will execute a second time if `i` is less than 9, but the initial value of `i` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than 9.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than 9**
