Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains a string where each '9' is replaced with '1', `res` contains 12 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the last character in `row` + 1, `row` is assigned the stripped input string for the loop to execute. The last character in `row` is not '9'***
