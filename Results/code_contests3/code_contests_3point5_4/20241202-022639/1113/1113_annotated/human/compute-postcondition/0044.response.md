Output State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object. If all elements in `row` are not equal to '9', then `nRow` will be the concatenation of all elements in `row`. If any element in `row` is equal to '9', then `nRow` will be the concatenation of all elements in `row` with '1' added for each element equal to '9'.**
