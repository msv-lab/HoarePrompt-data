Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object. If the next `i` is equal to '9', '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If the next `i` is not equal to '9', the value of the next `i` is concatenated at the end of `nRow`. The output state of `nRow` will depend on the specific values of `nRow` and `i` after the operation.***
