Postcondition: ***The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not empty. If the condition `i == '9'` is true, `nRow` is a string containing '1'. If the condition is false, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.***
