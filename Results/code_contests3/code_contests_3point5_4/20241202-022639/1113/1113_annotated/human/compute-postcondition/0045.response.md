Example Answer:
If all elements in `row` are not equal to '9', then `nRow` will be the concatenation of all elements in `row`. If any element in `row` is equal to '9', then `nRow` will be the concatenation of all elements in `row` with '1' added for each element equal to '9'. After that, `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended to the list `res`.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended to the list `res`**
