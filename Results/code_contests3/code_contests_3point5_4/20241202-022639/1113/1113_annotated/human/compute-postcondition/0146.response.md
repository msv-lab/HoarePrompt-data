Example Answer:
The input is stripped and stored in the variable `row`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` contains 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute again, `row` must not be empty.
