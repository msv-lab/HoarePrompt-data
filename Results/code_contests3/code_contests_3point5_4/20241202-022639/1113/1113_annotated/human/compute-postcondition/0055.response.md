According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is less than 9 and `row` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` has been appended with '1', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` has been appended with '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than 9 and `row` should have at least one element.
State: **`nRow` has been appended with '1', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than 9 and `row` should have at least one element**.
