According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is either the first element in `row` followed by '1' or the sum of the first element in `row` and `i`, `res` contains 11 empty strings, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` remains 9, `row` is an iterable object with at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more elements left in `row`.
State: **`nRow` is either the first element in `row` followed by '1' or the sum of the first element in `row` and `i`, `res` contains 11 empty strings, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` remains 9, `row` is an iterable object with at least 2 elements and the loop can execute one more time**
