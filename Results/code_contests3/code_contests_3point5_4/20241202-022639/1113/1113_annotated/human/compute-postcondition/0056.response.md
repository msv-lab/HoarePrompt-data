Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended with '11', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended with '11', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element**
