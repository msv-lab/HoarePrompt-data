Example Answer:
The `input` function is redefined to read from a BytesIO object created by `io.BytesIO()`. The BytesIO object reads from standard input using `os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)`. At the end, `readline` method is called on the BytesIO object.

Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit**
