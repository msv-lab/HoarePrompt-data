Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The value of `i` is determined by the next character in `row`. After execution, the value of `nRow` is modified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the updated result, `res` contains 10 copies of the final `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute again `row` must not be empty.
Output State: **`nRow` contains the updated result, `res` contains 10 copies of the final `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute again `row` must not be empty**
