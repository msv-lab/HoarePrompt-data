According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as it iterates through the range of 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `nRow` has been appended to the list `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, the current iteration count needs to be considered. Since the loop has already completed 1 iteration, for it to execute one more time, the iteration count `i` should be less than 9.
State: **`nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` should be less than 9**
