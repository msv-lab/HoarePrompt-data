Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the value `input().strip()`, where `input` accepts an input and `strip` removes any leading and trailing whitespaces. The value of `row` is dependent on the user input. The variable `nRow` is not mentioned in the code snippet, but it is stated that at the end of the loop, `nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is 9, but it is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged, `i` is 9.
Output State: **`nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged, `i` is 9**
