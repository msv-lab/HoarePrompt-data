According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is less than 9 and `row` has at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` has been appended with '11' because `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be less than 9 and `row` should still have at least one element.
State: **`nRow` has been appended with '11' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` has been appended with '19'. `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` should be less than 9 and `row` should have at least one element**.
