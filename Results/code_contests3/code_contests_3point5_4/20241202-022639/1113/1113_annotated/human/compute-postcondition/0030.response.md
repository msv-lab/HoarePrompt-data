According to the code, the loop can only execute if the variable `row` is iterable. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `nRow` needs to be a non-empty iterable object. Additionally, since `i` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged.
State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object, `i` is 9**
