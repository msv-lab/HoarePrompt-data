Example Answer:
`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, where `inf` represents infinity in Python. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity.
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity**
