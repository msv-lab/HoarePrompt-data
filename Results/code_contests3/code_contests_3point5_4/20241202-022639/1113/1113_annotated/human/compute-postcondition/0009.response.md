Example Answer:
`row` is assigned the stripped input value. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: the contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, and `i` is 0. Since `row` is the only affected variable, the Output State is: The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is assigned the stripped input value.
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is assigned the stripped input value**
