Example Answer:
The `atexit.register` function registers a lambda function that writes the value of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. In this case, `sys.stdout` is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`. Therefore, when the lambda function is called at exit, the value of `sys.stdout` (which is redirected to `io.BytesIO()`) will be written to the standard output (1). This means that the contents of `io.BytesIO()` will be output to the standard output. Other variables are not affected.
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit**
