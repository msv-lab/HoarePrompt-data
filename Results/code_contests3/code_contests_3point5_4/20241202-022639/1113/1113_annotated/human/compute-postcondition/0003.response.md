Example Answer:
The function `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, where `sys.stdout.write` is a function that writes to the standard output. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit.
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit**
