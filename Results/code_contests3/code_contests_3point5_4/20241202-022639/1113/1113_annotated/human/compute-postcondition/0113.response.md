Postcondition: ***`nRow` is either '1' if `i` is equal to '9' or it is the first element in `row` if `i` is not equal to '9'. `res` contains 11 copies of an empty string, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is 9, `row` is an iterable object with at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `row`.***
