According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `row` string. Before the loop starts, the loop will execute if the `row` string is not empty. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`, `res` contains 9 copies of the final `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is 9, `row` is the input string after stripping, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
