Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will contain '119', otherwise it will contain `i` concatenated with '1'. The value of `res` will then contain 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`. The values of `T`, `maxint`, and `io.BytesIO()` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, and for the loop to execute the next time, `row` should not be empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains either '119' or `i` concatenated with '1', `res` contains 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute the next time, `row` should not be empty.
Output State: **`nRow` contains either '119' or `i` concatenated with '1', `res` contains 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute the next time, `row` should not be empty**
