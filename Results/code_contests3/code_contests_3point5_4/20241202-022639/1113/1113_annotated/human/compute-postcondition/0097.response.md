Example Answer:
`nRow` now contains the values of `i` concatenated to it. As `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `nRow` will have values from 012345678. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the values 012345678, `res` contains 10 copies of `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `row` is not empty and contains the stripped input value.
