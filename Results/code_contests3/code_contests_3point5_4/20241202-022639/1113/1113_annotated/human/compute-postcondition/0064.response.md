Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '111' multiple times based on the value of `i`, which is always '9'. Therefore, `nRow` will have '111' appended to it each time. The existing elements in `res` are not affected, only `nRow` is modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended with '111' multiple times based on the value of `i`, `i` is always '9', and `row` has at least one element.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended with '111' multiple times based on the value of `i`, `i` is always '9', `row` has at least one element**
