Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains either '111' if `i` was '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i` concatenated with '1'. `res` contains 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`. `T` remains unchanged. `maxint` remains infinity. `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit. `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute the next time, `row` should not be empty.***
