Postcondition: ***`nRow` has been appended with '1', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` has been appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, the loop executes for the second time when `i` is less than 9 and `row` has at least one element, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
