Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with '1' at the end. Since `nRow` is a non-empty iterable object, it will now have an additional '1' at the end. The value of `i` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is an iterable object with '1' added at the end, the value of `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is an iterable object with '1' added at the end, the value of `i` is not equal to '9'**
