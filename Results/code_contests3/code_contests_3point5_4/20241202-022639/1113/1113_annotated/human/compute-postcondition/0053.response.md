Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`, which means `res` now contains an additional element. The loop will execute the second time when `i` is less than 9, and `row` has at least one element. After that, `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The specific values of `nRow`, `res`, and `i` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, loop executes the second time when `i` is less than 9 and `row` has at least one element, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, loop executes the second time when `i` is less than 9 and `row` has at least one element, `i` is not equal to '9'**
