Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string representation of `i`, where `i` iterates from 0 to 8. The initial value of `nRow` is a string, so after concatenation, `nRow` will be a string with numbers from 0 to 8. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string with numbers from 0 to 8, `res` contains 9 copies of an empty string, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string with numbers from 0 to 8, `res` contains 9 copies of an empty string, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable**
