The code `nRow += i` concatenates the value of `i` to the end of `nRow`. Since the initial state is `nRow` is a non-empty iterable object and the value of `i` is not '9', after execution, the output state will be:
Output State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object with the value of `i` concatenated at the end**
