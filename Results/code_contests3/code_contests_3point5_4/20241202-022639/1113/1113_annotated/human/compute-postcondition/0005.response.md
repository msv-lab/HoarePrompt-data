Example Answer:
The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list.
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list**
