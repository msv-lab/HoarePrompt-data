Postcondition: ***`nRow` is a string, `res` contains 9 copies of an empty string, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` is a non-empty iterable. If the value of `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is a string with the concatenated values of `i`.***
