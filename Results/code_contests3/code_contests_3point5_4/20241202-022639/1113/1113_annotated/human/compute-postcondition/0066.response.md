According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` remains unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must remain unchanged.
State: **`nRow` will be a string that consists of '111' repeated 9 times, `res` will contain 9 copies of `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit**
