Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the concatenated values of all `i` where '9' is replaced by '1', `res` contains 11 copies of the final `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is 9, `row` contains the stripped input value.
