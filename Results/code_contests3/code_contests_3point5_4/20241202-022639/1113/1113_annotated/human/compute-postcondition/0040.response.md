According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a non-empty iterable object. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of `i` is concatenated at the end of `nRow`. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object. If the next `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If the next `i` is not equal to '9', then the value of the next `i` is concatenated at the end of `nRow`**.
