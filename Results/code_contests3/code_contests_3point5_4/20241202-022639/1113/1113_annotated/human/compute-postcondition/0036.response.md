According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row` and the condition based on the value of `i`. If `i` is equal to '9', an additional element '1' is added to `nRow`.

At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a non-empty iterable object. If `i` is equal to '9', then an additional element '1' is added to `nRow`.

So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should not be equal to '9'.

State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object, the value of `i` is not equal to '9'**
