Example Answer:
The value of `i` is either '9' or not '9'. If `i` is '9', then '1' is added at the end of `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', then the value of `i` is concatenated at the end of `nRow`. The specific values of `nRow` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the specific values of `nRow` and `i`.
Output State: **The output state will depend on the specific values of `nRow` and `i` after the operation.**
