Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains the value of '11' if `i` is equal to '9', otherwise `nRow` contains the value of `i` concatenated with '1'. `res` contains 11 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit. `i` is updated based on the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute the next time `row` is not empty.***
