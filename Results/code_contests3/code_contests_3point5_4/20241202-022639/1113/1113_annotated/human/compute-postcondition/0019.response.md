Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The initial state mentions that `i` is incremented, so `i` has a value greater than 0. Therefore, `nRow` is updated by adding a positive value to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is incremented, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not empty, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`**
