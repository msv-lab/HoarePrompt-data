Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with `i`, and `i` is 9. Since `nRow` is an iterable object and `i` is an integer, the concatenation will result in an error. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a non-empty iterable object, `i` is 9, and `i` is not equal to the string '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is a non-empty iterable object, `i` is 9, and `i` is not equal to the string '9'**
