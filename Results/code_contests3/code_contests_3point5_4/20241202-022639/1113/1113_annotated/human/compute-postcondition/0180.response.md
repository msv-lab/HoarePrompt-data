Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains a string where each '9' is replaced with '11', `res` contains 12 copies of the final updated `nRow`, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is updated based on the last character in `row` + 1 (updated value), `row` is assigned the stripped input string for the loop to execute with more characters left in the string. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` contains a string where each '9' is replaced with '11' and updated with the value of `i`.***
