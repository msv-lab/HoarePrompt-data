Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` will have the value '11'. The loop will not execute the second time as `i` is already equal to 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` has been appended with '1', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element.
Output State: **`nRow` has been appended with '1', `i` is 9, `row` has at least one element**
