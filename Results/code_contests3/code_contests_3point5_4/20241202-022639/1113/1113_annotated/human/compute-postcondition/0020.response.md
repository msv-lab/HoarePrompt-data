Postcondition: ***The contents of `io.BytesIO()` are written to the standard output at exit, `maxint` is assigned the value representing infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is incremented, `row` is assigned the stripped input value and is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`.***
