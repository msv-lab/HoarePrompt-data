According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one element, the loop can execute. At the end of the first iteration, `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. So for the loop to execute a second time, `i` should be less than 9 and `row` should have at least one element.
State: **`nRow` has been appended to the list `res`, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is less than 9, `row` has at least one element**
