Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row` concatenated with the value of the current `i` plus '1' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains the updated value. `res` contains 10 copies of the final `nRow`. `T` remains unchanged. `maxint` remains infinity. `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit. `i` is updated based on the current character in `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must not be empty.***
