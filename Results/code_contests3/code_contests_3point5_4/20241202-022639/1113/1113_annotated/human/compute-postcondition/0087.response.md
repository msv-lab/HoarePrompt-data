Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The variables `nRow`, `res`, `T`, `maxint`, `io.BytesIO()`, `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string either with '1' appended to the end or with a concatenation of '1' and numbers from 0 to 9, `res` contains 10 copies of an empty string with `nRow` appended to it, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, for the loop to execute `i` is in the range of 0 to 8, `row` contains the stripped input value.
