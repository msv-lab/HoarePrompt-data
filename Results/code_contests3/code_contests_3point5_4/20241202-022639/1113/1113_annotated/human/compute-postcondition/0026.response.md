Example Answer:
After executing the code, the string `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `nRow` will contain a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', and all other characters in `row` remain unchanged. All other variables will retain their initial values, and the appended `nRow` is stored in the list `res`.
