#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nRow` contains a string where each '9' is replaced with '11', `res` contains 9 copies of the final updated `nRow` repeated for `T` times, `T` remains unchanged, `maxint` remains infinity, `io.BytesIO()` is written to standard output at exit, `i` is 9, `row` is an iterable object, and all occurrences of '9' in `row` have been replaced with '11'.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9. Within the nested loops, it replaces every occurrence of '9' in a row with '1' and appends the modified row to a list `res`. After processing all rows, it concatenates the modified rows with newline characters and writes the result to standard output. The function does not explicitly return any value.
