Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates all the cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer and finds the minimum remainder of the division by the given number 'm' among all good shifts. The program iterates through all the shifts and updates the minimum remainder accordingly. Finally, it prints the minimum remainder.

The program ensures that all the good shifts are considered by iterating through each digit of the input integer and shifting the digits accordingly. It correctly calculates and updates the minimum remainder for each shift.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
