Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the result of `a % b`. The variables `a`, `b`, `copya`, and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the new calculated value, `b` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum between its current value and the result of `a % b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is the new calculated value, `b` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum between its current value and the result of `a % b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
