According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
