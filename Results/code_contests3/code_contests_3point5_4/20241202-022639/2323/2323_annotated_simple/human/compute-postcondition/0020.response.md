Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Since the previous values of `ans`, `a`, and `b` are unknown, we can only determine that `a` is the updated value after the computation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the updated value after the computation.
Output State: **`a` is the updated value after the computation**
