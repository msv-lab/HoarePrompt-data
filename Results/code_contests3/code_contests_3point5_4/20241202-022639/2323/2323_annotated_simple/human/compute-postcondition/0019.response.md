Example Answer:
Initially, `a` is the result of a floor division of `a` by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`.

After executing the code snippet, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, where `h` is the last digit of `a`. The new value of `a` will be dependent on the current values of `c` and `h`.

Output State: **`a` is the updated value after the computation**
