Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c-1`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is the updated value after the computation, `b` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum between its current value and the result of `a % b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is the result of integer division of the original `a` by 10, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, for the loop to execute `c-1` is greater than 0, the last digit of `a` is 0, and `a` is updated to 10.***
