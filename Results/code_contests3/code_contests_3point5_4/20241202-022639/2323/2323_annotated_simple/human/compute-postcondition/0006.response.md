Example Answer: 
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the result of `a` integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the result of `a` integer division by 10**
