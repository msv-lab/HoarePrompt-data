Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c-1`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are updated. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `h` is the result of `a % 10`, `a` is updated by floor division by 10, and `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the result of `a % b`. If `a % 10 == 0`, then `h` is the remainder when `a` is divided by 10, and `a` is assigned the value 10.***
