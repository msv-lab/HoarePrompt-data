Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` is not defined in the initial state. The new value of `a` is based on the previous value of `a` and the new last digit `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the new last digit of `a`, `a` is updated based on the new last digit `h`.
Output State: **`h` is the new last digit of `a`, `a` is updated based on the new last digit `h`**
