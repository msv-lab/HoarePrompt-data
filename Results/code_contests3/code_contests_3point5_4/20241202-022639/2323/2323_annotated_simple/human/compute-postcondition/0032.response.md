Example Answer:
The value of `a` is divided by 10 using the `//` operator, which removes the last digit of `a`. Since `h` is the last digit of `a`, after this operation, `h` will be updated to the new last digit of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the new last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`h` is the new last digit of `a`**
