According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is considered as a boolean condition, the loop can execute if `copya` is True. Right before the loop, `copya` is the same as `a`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `a` needs to be a value that evaluates to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same as `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should evaluate to True**
