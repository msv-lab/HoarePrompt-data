Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` which is 0. The value of `a` is unknown, but it is mentioned that the last digit of `a` is 0. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0. The last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0. The last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is 0**
