Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c-1`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are integers. The final value of `a` is the updated value after the loop finishes executing, `b` remains the same, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus the number of times the loop executed, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value of the remainder of `a` divided by `b` after all iterations, `h` is the last digit of the final value of `a`.**
