Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. The value of `copya` changes based on the previous value of `copya`. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.**
