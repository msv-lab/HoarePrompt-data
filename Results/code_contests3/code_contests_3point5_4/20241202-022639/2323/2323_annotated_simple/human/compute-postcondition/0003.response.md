Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is an input integer. The value of `b` and `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same as `a`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same as `a`**
