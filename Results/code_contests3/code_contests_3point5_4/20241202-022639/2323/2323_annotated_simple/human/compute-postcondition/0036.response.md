Example Answer:
The value of `h` is assigned the result of `a % 10`, where `%` represents the modulo operation. The previous values of `a` and `h` are unknown, so the output state is: `a` is updated, `b` is updated, `c-1` is `c-2`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated, `h` is the result of `a % 10`.
Output State: **`a` is updated, `b` is updated, `c-1` is `c-2`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated, `h` is the result of `a % 10`**
