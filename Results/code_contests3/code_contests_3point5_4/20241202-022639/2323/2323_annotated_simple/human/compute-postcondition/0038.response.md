The value of `a` is updated by the formula `10 ** c * h + a`, where `h` is the result of `a % 10` and `c` is `c-1`. Additionally, `a` is updated by floor division by 10. The Output State is: `a` is updated, `b` is updated, `c-1` is `c-2`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated, `h` is the result of `a % 10`, `a` is updated by floor division by 10.
