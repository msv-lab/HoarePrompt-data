According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` values were not mentioned to be involved in the loop continuation condition, so they can remain unchanged. However, `copya` is the result of `a` integer division by 10, which means for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `copya` must be greater than 0.
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is the result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
