Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value `a % 10`, where `a` is the original input integer. The last digit of `a` can be any digit from 1 to 9, so the value of `h` will be the remainder of `a` divided by 10, which is the last digit of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
