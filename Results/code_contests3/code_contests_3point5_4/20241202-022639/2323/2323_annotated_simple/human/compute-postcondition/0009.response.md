Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
