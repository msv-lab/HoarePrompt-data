Example Answer:
`a` is updated to the integer division of the original value of `a` by 10. Since the condition `a % 10 == 0` is met, `c` is set to the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` becomes 0, `ans` is set to the result of `a % b`, and `h` is set to the last digit of `a`. The loop will execute as long as `c-1` is greater than 0.  
Output State: **`a` is the result of integer division of the original `a` by 10, `b`, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` minus 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
