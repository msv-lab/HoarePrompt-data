Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, which means it will have a value smaller than the previous value of `copya`. The loop will continue as long as `copya` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is the updated result of `a` integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than 0**
