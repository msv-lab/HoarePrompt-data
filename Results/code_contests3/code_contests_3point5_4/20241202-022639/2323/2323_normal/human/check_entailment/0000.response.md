Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division of Stepan's integer by the given number `m` for all good shifts of the integer. It iterates through all possible cyclic shifts of the integer and calculates the remainder after division by `m`. The code follows the problem description by considering all good shifts with no leading zeros. The logic of the code matches the problem requirements and there are no edge cases identified where the code fails to provide the correct output. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
