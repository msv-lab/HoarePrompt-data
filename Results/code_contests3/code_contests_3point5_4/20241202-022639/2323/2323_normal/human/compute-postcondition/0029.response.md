Output State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated to the value calculated by 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` added to the current value of `a`.**
