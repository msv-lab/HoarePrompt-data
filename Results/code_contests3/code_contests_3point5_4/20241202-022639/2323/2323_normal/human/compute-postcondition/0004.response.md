According to the code, the loop can execute if `copya` evaluates to True. Right before the loop, `copya` is 0. In Python, 0 is considered False, so in order for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that evaluates to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True**
