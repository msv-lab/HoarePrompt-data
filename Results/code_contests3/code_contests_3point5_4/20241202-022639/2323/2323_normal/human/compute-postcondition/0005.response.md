Example Answer:
`copya` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator. The value of `copya` needs to be a non-zero value for the loop to execute the first time. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True, `copya` is updated after floor division by 10.
Output State: **`c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True, `copya` is updated after floor division by 10**
