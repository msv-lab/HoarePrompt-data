Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum value of the remainders of `a` divided by `b` after each iteration of the loop. However, the initial value of `ans` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value of the remainders of `a` divided by `b` after each iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value of the remainders of `a` divided by `b` after each iteration of the loop**
