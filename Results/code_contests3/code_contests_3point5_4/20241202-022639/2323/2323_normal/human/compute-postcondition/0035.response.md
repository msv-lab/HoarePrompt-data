According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than 1.
State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`, `a` is updated to be 10, for the loop to execute the second time `c` must be greater than 1**
