Postcondition: ***`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`. If `a` % 10 != 0, then `h` is updated to the remainder of `a` divided by 10, `a` is updated to the value calculated by 10 raised to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` added to the current value of `a`. If `a` % 10 == 0, then `c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`, `a` is updated to be 10.***
