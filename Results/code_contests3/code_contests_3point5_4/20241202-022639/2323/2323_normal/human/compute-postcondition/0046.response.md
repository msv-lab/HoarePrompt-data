The function `func` accepts two positive integers: Stepan's integer and the number `m` for division. Stepan's integer has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` is such that 2 <= m <= 10^8. The function does not return any value explicitly but likely performs some operations on Stepan's integer based on the given constraints.
