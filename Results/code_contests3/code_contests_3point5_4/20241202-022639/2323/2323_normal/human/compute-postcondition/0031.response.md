Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10. The value of `a` is not specified in the initial state, so the value of `h` depends on the value of `a`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`.
Output State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`**
