According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` evaluates to True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, and `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True. Additionally, `copya` is updated after floor division by 10. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` after floor division by 10 should still evaluate to True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`c` is 1, `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True and after floor division by 10, `copya` still evaluates to True**
