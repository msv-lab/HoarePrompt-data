Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of an integer input. The value of `a` can be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: The input consists of two positive integers, the first one representing Stepan's integer and the second one representing the number m for division. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, and m is such that 2 <= m <= 10^8.
