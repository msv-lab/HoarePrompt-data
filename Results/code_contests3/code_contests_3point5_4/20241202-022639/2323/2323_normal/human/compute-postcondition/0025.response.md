Postcondition: ***`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`. If `a` % 10 != 0, `a` is updated to its integer division by 10 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If `a` % 10 == 0, `a` is updated to 10 and `h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10.***
