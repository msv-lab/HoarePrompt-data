Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, but the values of `a` and `b` are not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is 3, `copya` is 0, and `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, and `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`**
