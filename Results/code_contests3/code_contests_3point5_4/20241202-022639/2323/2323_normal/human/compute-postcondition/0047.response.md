Functionality: **The function `func` takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's integer and the number `m` for division. Stepan's integer has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` is within the range 2 <= m <= 10^8. The function calculates the minimum remainder of the division of Stepan's integer `a` by `b` after specific operations. The function then prints the calculated minimum remainder `ans`.**
