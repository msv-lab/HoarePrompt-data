Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to be 10 raised to the power of `c` times `h` plus `a`. The value of `a` is updated based on the existing values of `c` and `h`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`, and the new value of `a` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`c` is 3, `copya` is 0, `ans` is dependent on the values of `a` and `b`, for the loop to execute the second time `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is updated according to the conditions applied to `a`, `a` is updated to be 10 ** c * h + a**
