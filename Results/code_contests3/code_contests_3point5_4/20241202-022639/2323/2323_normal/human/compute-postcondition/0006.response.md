Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` is 0 initially, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The value of `copya` is not directly affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 1, `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True, `copya` is updated after floor division by 10.
Output State: **`c` is 1, `copya` needs to be a value that evaluates to True, `copya` is updated after floor division by 10**
