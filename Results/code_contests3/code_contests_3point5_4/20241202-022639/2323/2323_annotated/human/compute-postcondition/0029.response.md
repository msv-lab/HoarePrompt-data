Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` and c is greater than 0, `copya` is 0. If the last digit of `a` is not 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `a % b. The last digit of `a` is stored in `h`, `a` is divided by 10 and updated. If the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is the result of `a % 10`, `a` is updated by removing its last digit through integer division by 10, then `a` is updated to `10` is the updated state after the loop iteration, `h` is the result of `a % 10. `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`**
