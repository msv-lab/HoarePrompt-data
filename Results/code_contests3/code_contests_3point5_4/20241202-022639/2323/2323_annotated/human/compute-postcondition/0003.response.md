Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is Stepan's integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The number `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, and `b` is an input integer. The value of `c` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The number `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The number `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
