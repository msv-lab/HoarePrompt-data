Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by floor dividing it by 10. The previous value of `copya` is unknown, but after the operation, `copya` will have a reduced value. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by floor dividing it by 10.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by floor dividing it by 10**
