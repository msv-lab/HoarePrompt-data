According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is updated by floor dividing it by 10. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `copya` should be greater than 0 after the floor division by 10. No other states need adjustment for the loop to continue.
State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `copya` should be greater than 0 after the floor division by 10.**
