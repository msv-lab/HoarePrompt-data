Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should be a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive.
