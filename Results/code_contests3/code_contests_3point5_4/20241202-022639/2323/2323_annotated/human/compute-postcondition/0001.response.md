Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `b` will depend on the user input. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The integer does not contain leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer.
