Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The integer does not contain leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer. `c` is 0.
