Example Answer:
`copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. The value of `copya` is not given in the initial state, so it cannot be calculated accurately. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should be a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `a` should be a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive**
