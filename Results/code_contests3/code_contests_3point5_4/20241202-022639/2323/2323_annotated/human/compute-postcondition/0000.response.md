Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive, and m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, there are no changes to the initial state variables. 
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. The integer does not contain leading zeros. The number m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8.**
