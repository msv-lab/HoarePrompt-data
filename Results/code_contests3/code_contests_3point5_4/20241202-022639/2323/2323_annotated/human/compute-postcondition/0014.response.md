Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, where `%` represents the modulus operation. The values of `a`, `b`, and other variables are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will be: Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`.
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b**.
