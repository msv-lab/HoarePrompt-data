Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` as input. It calculates the number of digits in `a` and then performs a series of operations on `a` to find the minimum value of `a % b`. The final minimum value is printed as the output. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates on the input values of `a` and `b` based on the described constraints.**
