Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by multiplying 10 to the power of `c` with `h` and adding the original value of `a`. The previous values of `c` and `h` are known, and `c` is greater than 0. Therefore, the new value of `a` is calculated accordingly. Other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a` and c is greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b. The last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` is the result of `a % 10. `a` is divided by 10, `a` is updated with the new value.**
