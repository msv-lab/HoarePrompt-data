Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the parity of both strings 'a' and 'b' by counting the number of '1's in each string. It then compares the parity values and prints "YES" if the parity of 'a' is greater than or equal to the parity of 'b', otherwise it prints "NO". 

For all potential cases, the program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly determines whether it is possible to turn string 'a' into string 'b' based on the parity comparison. Therefore, the program is correct.
