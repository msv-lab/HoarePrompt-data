The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the bitwise AND of the binary representations of two integers, a and b, where a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters. The lengths of strings a and b are between 1 and 1000. The function returns the result of the bitwise AND operation as a string. 

Functionality: **The function calculates the bitwise AND of the binary representations of two integers given as strings a and b, and returns the result as a string.**
