Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the new `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, but if `i` is '1', `pb` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the new input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the new `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the new input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the new `i` is '1'**
