Example Answer: 
The code prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the comparison of `pa` and `pb`. Since `pa` is updated based on the total number of '1' characters in the input string, and `pb` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input string, the comparison result will determine the output. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is updated based on the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input string, and the code prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the comparison of `pa` and `pb`.
Output State: **`pa` is updated based on the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is equal to the total number of '1' characters in the input string, and the code prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the comparison of `pa` and `pb`**
