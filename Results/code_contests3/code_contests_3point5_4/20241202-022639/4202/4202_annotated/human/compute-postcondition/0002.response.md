Example Answer: 
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The initial state of `pa` is 0. Since the input provided by the user is not empty, `i` will be assigned a value from the input. Therefore, if the input contains '1', `pa` will increase by 1, otherwise `pa` will remain 0. 
Output State: **`pa` is 0 or 1**
