Example Answer: 
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the input string. The initial value of `pb` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time, the input string should not be empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
