According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user through raw_input(). If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more input available from raw_input().
State: **`pa` is 0 or 1, for the loop to execute one more time there should be more input available from raw_input()**
