According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input provided by the user. Since the loop is iterating over raw_input(), the loop will execute if there is any input given by the user. Before the loop starts, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that the input provided by the user is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, there should be some input provided by the user.
State: **a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, where 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000, pa is 0, input provided by the user is not empty**
