Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, where 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000, pa is 0.
Output State: **a and b are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, where 1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000, pa is 0**
