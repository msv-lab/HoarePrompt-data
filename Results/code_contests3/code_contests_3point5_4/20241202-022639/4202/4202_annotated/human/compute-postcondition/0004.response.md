Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pa` is either 0 or 1, and the value of `i` is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'**
