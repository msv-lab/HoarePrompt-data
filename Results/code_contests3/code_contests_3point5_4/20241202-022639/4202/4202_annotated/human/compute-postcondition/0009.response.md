According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If the input string is not empty, the loop can execute. At the start, `pa` is incremented by the number of '1' characters in the input string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input string is not empty and `pa` has been updated based on the number of '1' characters in the input string.
State: **`pa` is updated based on the number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input string is not empty**
