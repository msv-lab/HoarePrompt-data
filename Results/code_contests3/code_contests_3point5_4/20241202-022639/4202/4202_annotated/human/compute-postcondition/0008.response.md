Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is assigned 0. The value of `pa` is incremented by the number of '1' characters in the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by the number of '1' characters in the input string; `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by the number of '1' characters in the input string; `pb` is 0**
