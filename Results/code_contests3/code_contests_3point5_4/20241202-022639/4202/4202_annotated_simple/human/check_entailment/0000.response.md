Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of '1's in the input strings a and b. It then compares these counts and prints "YES" if the number of '1's in a is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in b, and "NO" otherwise. This follows the problem description accurately as it checks if it is possible to turn a into b based on the number of '1's in each string.
