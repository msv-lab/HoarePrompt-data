`pb` is assigned the value 0. The variable `pa` holds the number of times '1' appears in the input string, but its specific value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0**
