According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by the user. If there are more characters in the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is incremented by 1 based on the condition `i == '1'`. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in the input.
State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 based on the condition `i == '1'`, for the loop to execute one more time there must be more characters in the input**
