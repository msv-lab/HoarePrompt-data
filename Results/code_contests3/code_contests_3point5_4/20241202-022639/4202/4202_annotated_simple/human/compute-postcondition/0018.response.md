Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes two input strings, a and b, which are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters. The function counts the occurrences of '1' in both strings and prints 'YES' if the count of '1' in string a is greater than or equal to the count in string b; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value. **
