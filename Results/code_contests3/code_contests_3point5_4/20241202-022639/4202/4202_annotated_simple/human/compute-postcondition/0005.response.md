According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input characters. If there are more characters in the input, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters in the input.
State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', loop executes one more time if there are more characters in the input**
