Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'. Since no initial value for `i` is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `pb`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'**
