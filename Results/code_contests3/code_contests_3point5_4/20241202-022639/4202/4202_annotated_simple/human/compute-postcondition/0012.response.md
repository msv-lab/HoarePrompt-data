Example Answer: 
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, but if `i` is equal to '1', `pb` will increment by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'**
