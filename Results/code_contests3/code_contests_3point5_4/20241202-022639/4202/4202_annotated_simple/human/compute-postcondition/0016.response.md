Example Answer:
The code prints 'YES' if the number of times '1' appears in the input string stored in `pa` is greater than or equal to the number of times '1' appears in the input string stored in `pb`. Since both `pa` and `pb` have the same value, the condition `pa >= pb` is always true. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is the same as `pa`, and 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is the same as `pa`, 'YES' is printed**
