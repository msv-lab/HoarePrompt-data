Example Answer:
The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the input character `i` is equal to '1'. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `i` or the input character, the final output state cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 based on the condition `i == '1'`.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 based on the condition `i == '1'`**
