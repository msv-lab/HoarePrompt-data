Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pa` is unknown, but if `i` is indeed '1', then `pa` will be increased by 1. The loop will execute one more time if there are more characters in the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', loop executes one more time if there are more characters in the input.
Output State: **`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', loop executes one more time if there are more characters in the input**
