According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the input string. Since we don't have specific information about the input string, we need to focus on `pa` and `pb`. 
To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states to indicate that the input string is not empty and `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, while `pb` remains 0.
State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the input string is not empty**
