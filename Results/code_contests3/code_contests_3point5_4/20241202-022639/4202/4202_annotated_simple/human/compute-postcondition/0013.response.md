According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are more characters left in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the input string.
State: **`pa` is the number of times '1' appears in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is equal to '1'**
