Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the number of '1's in strings a and b and then prints "YES" if the number of '1's in a is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in b, and "NO" otherwise. This logic aligns with the problem description as it checks if it is possible to turn string a into string b based on the number of '1's. The program covers all potential cases as it correctly implements the required logic.
