Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters; `pa` is 0**
