Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `i` is '1'. The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are 01-strings, so `i` can only be '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', `pb` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is equal to the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is updated based on the comparison of `i` with '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is equal to the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is updated based on the comparison of `i` with '1'**
