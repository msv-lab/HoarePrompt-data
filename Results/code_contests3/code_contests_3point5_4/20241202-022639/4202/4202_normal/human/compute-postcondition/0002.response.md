The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The value of `i` can be '0' or '1'. Therefore, the output state is: a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters; `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters; `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'**
