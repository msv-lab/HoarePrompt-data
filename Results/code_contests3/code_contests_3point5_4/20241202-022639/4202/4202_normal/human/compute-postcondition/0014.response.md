Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is equal to the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is updated based on the comparison of `i` with '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, `pa` is equal to the number of occurrences of '1' in the input string, `pb` is updated based on the comparison of `i` with '1'**
