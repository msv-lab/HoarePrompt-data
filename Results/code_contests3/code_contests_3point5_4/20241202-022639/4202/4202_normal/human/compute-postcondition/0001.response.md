According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. Since the length of the input string is not specified, we need to ensure that the input is not empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **a and b are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, containing only "0" and "1" characters; `pa` is 0, the input string from raw_input() is not empty**
