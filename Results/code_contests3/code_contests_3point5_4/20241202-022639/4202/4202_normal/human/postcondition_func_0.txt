The function `func` calculates the number of occurrences of '1' in two input strings of 01-characters of length between 1 and 1000. It then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
