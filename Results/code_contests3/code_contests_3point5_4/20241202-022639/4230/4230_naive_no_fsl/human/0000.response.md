Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the smallest integer k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house. The program iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order and checks if the door at index i is in a different exit than the door at index i+1. If it finds such a door, it updates the ans variable to i+1 and breaks out of the loop. This logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the smallest index k at which Mr. Black can exit the house. 

Additionally, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the scenario where Mr. Black opens all the doors in one exit before being able to exit the house. The program also considers the case where Mr. Black alternates between opening doors from different exits before being able to exit the house. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the correctness of the program is **True**.
