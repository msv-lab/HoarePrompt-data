Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of mapping `int` to the input values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The initial value of `n` is not directly used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the input, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input**
