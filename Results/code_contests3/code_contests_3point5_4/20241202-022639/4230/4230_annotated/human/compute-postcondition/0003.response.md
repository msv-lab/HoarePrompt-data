Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. Since there are no operations that affect `ans`, it remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the input, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `ans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `ans` is 0**
