The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to simulate the opening and closing of doors in a building with `n` doors, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000. The function will iterate through the sequence of opened doors, represented by a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 (0 for left exit, 1 for right exit), and determine the final status of the doors after all the iterations. The function will not return any value, as it will only update the state of the doors.
