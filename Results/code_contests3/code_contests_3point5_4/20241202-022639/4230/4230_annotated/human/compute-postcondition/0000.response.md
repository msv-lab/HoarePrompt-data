Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it by whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts each input into an integer. The initial state of `n` is an integer between 2 and 200,000, and after execution, `n` becomes a map object containing integers from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a map object containing integers from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a map object containing integers from the input**
