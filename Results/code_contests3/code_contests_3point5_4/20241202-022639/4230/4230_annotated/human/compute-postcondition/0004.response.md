According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `ans` being 0 is not relevant to the execution of the loop. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be at least 3, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, and `i` is equal to `n - 2`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `n - 2`**.
