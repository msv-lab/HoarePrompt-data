Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is equal to `n - 2`. The value of `n` is at least 3, so `i` is at least 1. Therefore, `ans` will be at least 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `ans` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is equal to `n - 2`. At index `i` and `i + 1` of list `c`, the elements are not equal**
