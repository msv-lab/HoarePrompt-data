Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is equal to the index of the first occurrence where the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1` in the list `c`. The initial state does not specify the values in the list `c`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, and `ans` is equal to the index of the first occurrence where the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1` in the list `c`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `c` is a mapped list of integers from the input, `ans` is equal to the index of the first occurrence where the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1` in the list `c`**
