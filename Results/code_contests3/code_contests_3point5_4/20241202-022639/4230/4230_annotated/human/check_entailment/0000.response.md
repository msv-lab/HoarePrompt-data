Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors and finds the index of the first occurrence where the status of adjacent doors differs. This index is the smallest k such that after opening the first k doors, Mr. Black can exit the house. The program then prints this index, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

The program handles all cases where Mr. Black opens the doors in a specific sequence, ensuring that the correct index is identified. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
