The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a sequence of integers representing the status of doors in a building. It then iterates through the sequence to find the index of the first occurrence where the status of adjacent doors differs. This index is stored in the variable `ans` and printed. The function does not return any value, it only updates the state of the doors.
