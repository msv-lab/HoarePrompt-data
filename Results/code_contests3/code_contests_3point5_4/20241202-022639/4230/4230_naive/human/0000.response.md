Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, iterates through the doors in reverse order, and stops at the first door where the exit changes from left to right or vice versa. This indicates the point at which Mr. Black can exit the house. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
