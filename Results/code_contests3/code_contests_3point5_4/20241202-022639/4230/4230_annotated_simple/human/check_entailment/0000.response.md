Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program only considers the last change in the door sequence to determine the exit possibility, while the problem requires finding the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, Mr. Black can exit the house. 

The program only tracks the last change in the door sequence, but it does not ensure that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors. It does not consider all possible scenarios where Mr. Black may be able to exit the house before the last change in the door sequence. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
