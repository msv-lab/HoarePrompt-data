Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 2` for the loop to execute. If the element at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`, the loop or if statement breaks out.***
