Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to integers. The input represents the sequence of doors Mr. Black opened, with 0 for left exit and 1 for right exit. The initial state does not specify the sequence of integers, so the output state only indicates that `n` is a mapped integer sequence.
Output State: **`n` is a mapped integer sequence**
