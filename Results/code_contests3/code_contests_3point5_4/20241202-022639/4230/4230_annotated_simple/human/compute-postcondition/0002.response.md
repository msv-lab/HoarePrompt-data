Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the mapped integer sequence of the input values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is the first element of the mapped integer sequence, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values.
Output State: **`n` is the first element of the mapped integer sequence, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values**
