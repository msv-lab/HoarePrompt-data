According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. So, before the loop starts, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, since the loop iterates in reverse order from `n - 2` to -1, `i` should start at `n - 2`. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values, `ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 2` for the loop to execute**
