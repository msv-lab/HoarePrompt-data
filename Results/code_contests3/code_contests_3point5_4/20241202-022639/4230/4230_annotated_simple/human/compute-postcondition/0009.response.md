According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i - 1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `i` is equal to `n - 3` for the loop to execute one more time**
