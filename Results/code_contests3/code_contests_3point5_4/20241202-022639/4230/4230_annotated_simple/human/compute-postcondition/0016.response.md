Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is the mapped integer sequence of the input values. If `c[i] != c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to `i + 1` where `i` is equal to `n - 2` for the loop to execute one more time. After the execution of the if else block, `ans` is equal to `i + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
