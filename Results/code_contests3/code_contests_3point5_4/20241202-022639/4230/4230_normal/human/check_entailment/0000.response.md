Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads the input and iterates through the list of door locations to find the index of the last occurrence where the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1`. This index represents the smallest integer `k` such that after Mr. Black opened the first `k` doors, he was able to exit the house. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming its correctness.
