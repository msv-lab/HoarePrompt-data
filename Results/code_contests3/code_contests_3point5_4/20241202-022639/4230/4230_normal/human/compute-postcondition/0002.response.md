Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input list created by splitting the input. Since the initial state does not provide the exact input values, the exact values of `c` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: n is now assigned the value of the first element of the list n[0].
Output State: **n is now assigned the value of the first element of the list n[0]**
