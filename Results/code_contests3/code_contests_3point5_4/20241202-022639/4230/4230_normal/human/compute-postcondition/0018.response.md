Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans` which represents the index of the last occurrence where the element at index `i` is different from the element at index `i + 1` in the list `c`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `ans` is at least 1.
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `ans` is at least 1**
