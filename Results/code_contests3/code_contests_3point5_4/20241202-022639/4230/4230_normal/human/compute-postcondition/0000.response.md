Example Answer:
n is assigned the value map(int, raw_input().split()), where raw_input() accepts input and splits it based on spaces, then map converts each element to an integer. The sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 representing the location of the door (left exit or right exit). Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 representing the location of the door (left exit or right exit).
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 representing the location of the door (left exit or right exit)**
