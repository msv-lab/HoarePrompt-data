Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0. If the element at index `i` in the list `c` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`, the loop will execute one more time. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `n` remains at least 3, `i` is 1, `ans` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
