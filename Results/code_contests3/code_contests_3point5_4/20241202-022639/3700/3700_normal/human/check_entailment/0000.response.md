# Your task:

Problem description: Fennec is fighting with N monsters.

The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

Fennec can do the following two actions:

* Attack: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will decrease by 1.
* Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.

There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.

Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.

Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

N K
H_1 ... H_N

Output

Print the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if c >= mod:
        c -= mod
    return c
''' 

 Output description for function1:  The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns the result. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to the variable `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum before returning. Missing functionality: There is no explicit handling for cases where the input parameters `a` and `b` are not integers, and the behavior for such cases is not defined.

Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (H, N) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if s >= H:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
mod = 1000000000.0 + 7
func_2()
''' 

 Output description for function2:  The function `func_2` reads two integers H and N from input, calculates the sum of N integers, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, or 'No' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on the input values.

Based on the code and the description provided, let's analyze the correctness of the program:

1. The `func_1` function seems to correctly calculate the sum of two integers and return the result. The handling of cases where `a` and `b` are not integers is not defined, but this is not a requirement according to the problem description. The function follows the given problem description.

2. The `func_2` function reads two integers `H` and `N` from input, calculates the sum of `N` integers, and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'No' otherwise. This function does not directly relate to the problem description provided. It seems to be a separate function for a different problem. As per the problem description, the program should find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. Therefore, this function does not align with the given problem requirements.

Since the second function does not fulfill the problem description and is unrelated to the task of determining the minimum number of attacks needed to win against the monsters, the Correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
