Example Answer:
H and N are assigned values from the input split by space. The values are integers, so H is a positive integer and N is a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: H are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, N is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5.
Output State: **H are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, N is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5**
