Example Answer: 
The code simply prints 'No' to the console. The variables `H`, `N`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, `s` is less than `H`.
Output State: **`H` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5, `s` is less than `H`**
