Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of the integers inputted in a single line separated by spaces. The values of H and N are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: H are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, N is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5.
Output State: **H are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, N is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5**
