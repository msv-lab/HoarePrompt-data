Example Answer:
`H` is assigned the first value from the input list, and `N` is assigned the second value from the input list. The values of `N` and `H` are based on the user input, so the output state is: `N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i in the range [1, N]; `H` is an integer, `N` is an integer.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5. `H_i` is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i in the range [1, N]; `H` is an integer, `N` is an integer**
