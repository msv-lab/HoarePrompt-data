Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input for integers H and N, and then reads a list of integers to calculate their sum. It compares the sum to H and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output based on the inputs.**
