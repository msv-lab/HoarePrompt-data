Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of a list of integers created from the input. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and then summed up. The variables N, K, H_i, and H are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5, H_i is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i in the range [1, N]; H is an integer, N is an integer.
Output State: **N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2*10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2*10^5, H_i is an integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i in the range [1, N]; H is an integer, N is an integer**
