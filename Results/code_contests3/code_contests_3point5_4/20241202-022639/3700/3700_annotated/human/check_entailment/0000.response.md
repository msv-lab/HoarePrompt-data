Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_2` reads input for integers H and N, and then reads a list of integers to calculate their sum. It compares the sum to H and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. This logic does not align with the problem description of Fennec fighting monsters and needing to calculate the minimum number of times to attack before winning.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
