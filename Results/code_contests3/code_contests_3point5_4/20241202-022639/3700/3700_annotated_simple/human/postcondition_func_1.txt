The function `func_2` reads two inputs: a list of integers `H` and an integer `N`. It then calculates the sum `s` of another list of integers. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to the elements in list `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the constraints provided for `N`, `K`, and `H_i`.
