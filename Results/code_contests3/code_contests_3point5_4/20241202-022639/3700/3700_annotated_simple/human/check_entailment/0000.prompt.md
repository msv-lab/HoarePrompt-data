You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Fennec is fighting with N monsters.

The health of the i-th monster is H_i.

Fennec can do the following two actions:

* Attack: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will decrease by 1.
* Special Move: Fennec chooses one monster. That monster's health will become 0.



There is no way other than Attack and Special Move to decrease the monsters' health.

Fennec wins when all the monsters' healths become 0 or below.

Find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 0 \leq K \leq 2 \times 10^5
* 1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9
* All values in input are integers.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N K
H_1 ... H_N


Output

Print the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `c` is the result of `a + b` and `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to the result of `a + b` minus `mod`, and the new value of `c` is less than `mod`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    return c
    #The program returns the updated value of 'c' which is less than 'mod' after the specified condition is applied

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N and K are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. H_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each i from 1 to N.**
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5, s is the sum of the entered integers. If the sum of the entered integers is greater than or equal to the elements in list H, then the overall sum s is equal to H. Otherwise, the sum s is less than H.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
