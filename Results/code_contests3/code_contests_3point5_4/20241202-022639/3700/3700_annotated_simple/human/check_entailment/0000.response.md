Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not address the given problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not related to the problem of Fennec fighting monsters. The program does not calculate the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
