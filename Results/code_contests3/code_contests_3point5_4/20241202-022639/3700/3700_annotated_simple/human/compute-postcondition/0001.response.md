Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of all the integers entered by the user after splitting the input by spaces. The input is split into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers and summed up. The initial states are not affected except for the input operation. Therefore, the Output State is: H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5, and the sum of the entered integers is stored in variable s.
Output State: **H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5, s is the sum of the entered integers**
