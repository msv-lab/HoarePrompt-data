Postcondition: ***H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5, s is the sum of the entered integers. If the sum of the entered integers is greater than or equal to the elements in list H, then the overall sum s is equal to H. Otherwise, the sum s is less than H.***
