Example Answer: 
H and N are assigned values from the input split by space. H is a list of integers, and N is an integer. The values of H_i are positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, and N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5.
Output State: **H is a list of positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9, N is a non-negative integer ranging from 1 to 2 * 10^5**
