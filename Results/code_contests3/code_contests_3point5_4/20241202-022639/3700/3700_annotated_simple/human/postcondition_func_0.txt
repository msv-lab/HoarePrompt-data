The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and if the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from the sum and returns the updated value. The function ensures that the returned value of `c` is always less than `mod`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is less than `mod`, the function returns the sum without any modifications.
