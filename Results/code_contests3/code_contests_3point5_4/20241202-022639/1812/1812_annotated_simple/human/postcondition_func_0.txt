The function `func` reads an input string S from standard input, extracts an integer N and a character C from the string, performs some calculations on N and C based on predefined rules, and then prints a result calculated from N and C. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is determined by the formula provided in the print statement. The code does not fully align with the annotations as the actual logic involves bitwise operations and calculations based on N and C.
