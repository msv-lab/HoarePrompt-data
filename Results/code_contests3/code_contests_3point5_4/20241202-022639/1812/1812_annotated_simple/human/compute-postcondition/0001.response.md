Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value of the input obtained from `gets()`. The value of `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f' and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets().
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets()**
