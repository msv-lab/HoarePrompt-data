Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `(N - 1) % 3`. The value of `N` depends on the input obtained from `gets()`, and `C` is calculated based on the last character of `S`. Therefore, the value of `M` will vary based on the input provided for `N`. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets(), N is an integer depending on the input provided, C is calculated based on the last character of S, M is calculated based on the value of N**
