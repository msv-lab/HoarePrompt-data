Example Answer:
N is subtracted by M. The value of M can be either 1 or 2, so after execution, the value of N will be either N-1 or N-2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets(), N is an integer depending on the input provided and either N-1 or N-2, C is calculated based on the last character of S, M is calculated based on the value of N and is either 1 or 2.
