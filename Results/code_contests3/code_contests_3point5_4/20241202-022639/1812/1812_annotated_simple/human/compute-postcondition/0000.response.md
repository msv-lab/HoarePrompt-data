Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to take an optional argument `r` which defaults to `sys.stdin.readline`, and it returns the stripped input line. Since this lambda function does not directly affect the initial state variables `n` and `s`, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f'**
