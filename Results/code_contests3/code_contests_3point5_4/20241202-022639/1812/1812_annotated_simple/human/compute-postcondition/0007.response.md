Example Answer:
`M` is XORed with 3, which means M will toggle between 1 and 2. If M is 1, then after execution M will be 2, and if M is 2, then after execution M will be 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets(), N is an integer depending on the input provided and either N-1 or N-2, C is calculated based on the last character of S, M is toggled between 1 and 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets(), N is an integer depending on the input provided and either N-1 or N-2, C is calculated based on the last character of S, M is toggled between 1 and 2**
