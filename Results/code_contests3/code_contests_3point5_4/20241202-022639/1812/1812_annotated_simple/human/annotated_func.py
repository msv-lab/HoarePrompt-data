#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer and s is a character from 'a' to 'f'.**
def func():
    gets = lambda r=sys.stdin.readline: r().strip()
    S = gets()
    N = int(S[:-1])
    C = ord(S[-1]) - ord('a')
    M = N - 1 & 3
    if (M in (1, 2)) :
        N -= M
        M ^= 3
        N += M
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f', S is the input obtained from gets(), N is an integer depending on the input provided and either N-1 or N-2, C is calculated based on the last character of S, M is toggled between 1 and 2, N is incremented by M. If M is either 1 or 2, the function updates the values of N, C, and M as described above.
    print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string S from standard input, extracts an integer N and a character C from the string, performs some calculations on N and C based on predefined rules, and then prints a result calculated from N and C. The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is determined by the formula provided in the print statement. The code does not fully align with the annotations as the actual logic involves bitwise operations and calculations based on N and C.
