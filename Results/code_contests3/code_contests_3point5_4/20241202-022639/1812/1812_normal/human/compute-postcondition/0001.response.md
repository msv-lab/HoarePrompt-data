Example Answer: 
`s` is re-assigned the value of `gets()`, which reads a line from the standard input. The value of `s` can be any character from 'a' to 'f' based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f'.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, s is a character from 'a' to 'f'**
