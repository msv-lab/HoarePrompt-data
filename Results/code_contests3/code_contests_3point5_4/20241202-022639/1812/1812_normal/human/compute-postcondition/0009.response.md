Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `N` is an integer value derived from `S[:-1]` decreased by either 1 or 2, `C` is a value between 0 and 5, `M` is a value between 0 and 3, `M` is either 1 or 2, and after the execution of the if part, `M` is the result of XOR operation with 3 and `N` is increased by the new value of `M`.***
