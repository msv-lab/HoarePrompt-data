Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the last character of `S` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. Since `S` is a character from 'a' to 'f', the value of `C` will be between 0 and 5. The value of `N` is derived from `S[:-1]`, which means it will be the integer value of the characters before the last character in `S`. The Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `N` is an integer value derived from `S[:-1] and `C` is a value between 0 and 5.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `N` is an integer value derived from `S[:-1] and `C` is a value between 0 and 5**
