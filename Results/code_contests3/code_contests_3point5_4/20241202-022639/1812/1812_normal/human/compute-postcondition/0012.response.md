Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes the input to calculate a value based on specific operations, and then prints the result. It does not accept any parameters. The calculations involve manipulating the input values `N`, `C`, and `M` based on certain conditions, and finally, it computes a result using these values and prints it. The function ensures that `N` is a positive integer, `S` is a character from 'a' to 'f', and performs arithmetic operations to derive a final value for output.**
