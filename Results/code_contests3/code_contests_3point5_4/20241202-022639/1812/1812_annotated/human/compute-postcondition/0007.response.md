Example Answer:
M is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with 3. If M is currently 1, it will become 2, and if M is currently 2, it will become 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), C is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of s, N is the updated row number after subtracting M, where M is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), C is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of s, N is the updated row number after subtracting M, where M is either 1 or 2**
