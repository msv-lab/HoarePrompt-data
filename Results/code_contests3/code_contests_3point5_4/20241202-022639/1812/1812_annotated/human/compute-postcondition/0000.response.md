Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline` and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. Since the function `gets` is defined but not yet called, the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, and s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, and s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f')**
