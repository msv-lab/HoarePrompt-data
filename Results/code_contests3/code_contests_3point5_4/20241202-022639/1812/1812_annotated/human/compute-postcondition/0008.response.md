Example Answer:
The value of N is updated by adding M, where M can be either 1 or 2. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), C is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of s, N is the updated row number after subtracting M, where M is either 1 or 2.
