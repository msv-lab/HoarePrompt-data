Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `N - 1 & 3`. The value of `N` is extracted from the input seat number, `C` is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of `s`. Since the specific values of `n` and `s` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value of `M`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is the row number extracted from the input seat number, C is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of s.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is the row number extracted from the input seat number, C is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of s**
