Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the row number, `s` is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), `C` is the result of subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the last character of `s`, `N` is the updated row number after subtracting `M`, where `M` is either 1 or 2. The result of the expression `print((N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C))` is calculated and printed.**
