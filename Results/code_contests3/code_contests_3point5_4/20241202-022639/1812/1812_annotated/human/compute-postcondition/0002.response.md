Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the integer value obtained by removing the last character from the input string `S`. Since `S` represents a seat number in the format 'row number + seat letter', removing the last character gives us the row number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is the row number extracted from the input seat number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the row number, s is a character representing the seat in that row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'), N is the row number extracted from the input seat number**
