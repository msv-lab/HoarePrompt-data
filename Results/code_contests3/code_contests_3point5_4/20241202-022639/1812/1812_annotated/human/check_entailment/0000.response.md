Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input row number and seat character, calculates the seat number based on the position of the seat in the row, and then computes the total time Vasya has to wait before getting his lunch.

The program handles the cases where the flight attendants move in a pattern of maintaining a distance of two rows from each other, serving passengers in a specific order, and moving forward in a specific manner. The computation of the time Vasya has to wait is consistent with the rules mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
