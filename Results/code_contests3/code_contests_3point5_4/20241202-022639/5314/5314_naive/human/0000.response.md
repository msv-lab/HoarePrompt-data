Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book exactly on the last day within the available time. In this case, the program should output the last day as the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book. 

Example:
Input
```
3 5
50000 20000 16395
```
Output
```
3
```
Expected Output
```
3
``` 

In the above example, Luba finishes reading the book on the third day exactly at the end of the day, but the program outputs 4 instead of 3.
