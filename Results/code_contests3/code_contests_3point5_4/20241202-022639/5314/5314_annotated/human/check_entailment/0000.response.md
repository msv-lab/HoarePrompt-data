Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The main issue is that the program does not consider the case where Luba finishes reading the book before completing all the days of work. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the scenario where Luba finishes reading the book exactly on the last day of work. It only prints the number of days worked, not the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
