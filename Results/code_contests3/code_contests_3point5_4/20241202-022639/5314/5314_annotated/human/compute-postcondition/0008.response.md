Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 1, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 2**
