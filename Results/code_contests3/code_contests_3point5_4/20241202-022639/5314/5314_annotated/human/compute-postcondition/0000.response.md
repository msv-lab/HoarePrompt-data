Example Answer:
n and t are assigned values using list(map(int, raw_input().split()), where raw_input() reads a line from input and split() splits the line into a list of strings. The values entered should be positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400.**
