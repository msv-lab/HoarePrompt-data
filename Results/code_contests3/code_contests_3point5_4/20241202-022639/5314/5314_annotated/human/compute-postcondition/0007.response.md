Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by the result of the expression `86400 - int(a[i])`. The value of `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. The value of `t` is a positive integer, and `a[i]` contains a non-negative integer less than or equal to 86400. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1**
