Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by the result of 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the value of the element at index `i` in the array `ai`. The value of `t` can be changed based on the difference between 86400 and `a[i]`. Since the initial state of `i` is 0, the value of `a[0]` is considered. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0, and the value of `t` is adjusted based on the calculation.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0, and the value of `t` is adjusted based on the calculation**
