Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it based on spaces. The values of `n`, `t`, and `ai` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400.**
