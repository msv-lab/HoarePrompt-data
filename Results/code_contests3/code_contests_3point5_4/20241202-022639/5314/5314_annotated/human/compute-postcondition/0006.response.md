According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `t` needs to be adjusted such that it remains positive after the next iteration. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1**
