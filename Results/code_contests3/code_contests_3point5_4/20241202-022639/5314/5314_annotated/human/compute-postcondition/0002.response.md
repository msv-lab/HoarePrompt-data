Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400; `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400; `i` is 0**
