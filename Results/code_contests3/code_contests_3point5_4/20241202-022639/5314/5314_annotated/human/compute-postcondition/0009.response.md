According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer. So no adjustments are needed for `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` remains greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 0**
