Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0. After execution, `i` becomes 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1, and the value of `t` is adjusted based on the calculation.
