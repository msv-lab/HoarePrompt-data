Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 2. After execution, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer**
