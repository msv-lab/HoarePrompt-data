According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` and `t` are positive integers, so they already satisfy the conditions for the loop to execute. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time no other states need to be adjusted**
