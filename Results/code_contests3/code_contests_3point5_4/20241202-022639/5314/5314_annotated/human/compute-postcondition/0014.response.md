The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to process a list `ai` containing `n` non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400. The function then performs some operations on the list `ai` based on the constraints provided. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it processes the list `ai` according to the constraints given.
