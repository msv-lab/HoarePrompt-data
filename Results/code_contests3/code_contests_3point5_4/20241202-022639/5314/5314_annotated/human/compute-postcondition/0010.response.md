Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 minus the integer value of `a[i]` where `i` is 2. The value of `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. The constraints ensure that the value of `t` will always be positive after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `ai` contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer**
