The loop will continue executing until t becomes less than or equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop decreases t by the difference between 86400 and the current element of ai. The loop also increments i by 1 in each iteration.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai contains n non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400, i is equal to the number of elements in ai, t is a positive integer**
