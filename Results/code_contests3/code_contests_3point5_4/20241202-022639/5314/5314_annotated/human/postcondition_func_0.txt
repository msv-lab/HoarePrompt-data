The function `func` reads input values `n` and `t`, then processes a list `ai` containing `n` non-negative integers where each element is less than or equal to 86400. It iterates through the list `ai` decrementing `t` by 86400 minus the current element until `t` becomes non-positive. The function prints the number of elements processed `i`. It does not explicitly return any value. There is a missing edge case where `t` might become negative before processing all elements of `ai`.
