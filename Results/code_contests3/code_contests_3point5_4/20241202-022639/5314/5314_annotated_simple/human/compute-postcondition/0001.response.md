Example Answer:
The input is split into a list `a`. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers, but they are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values**
