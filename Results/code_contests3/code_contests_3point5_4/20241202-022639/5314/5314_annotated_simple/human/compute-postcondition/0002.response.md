Example Answer:
The value of `i` is initialized to 0. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 0**
