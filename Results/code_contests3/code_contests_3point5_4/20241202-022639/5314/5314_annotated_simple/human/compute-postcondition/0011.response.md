Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 3, `t` is updated based on the calculation described above.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `a` is a list containing the input values, `i` is 3, `t` is updated based on the calculation described above**
