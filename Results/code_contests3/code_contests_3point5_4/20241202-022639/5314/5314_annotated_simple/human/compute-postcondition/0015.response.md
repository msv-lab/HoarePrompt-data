Functionality: **The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `t`, as well as a list of non-negative integers `a`. It iterates through the list `a` and subtracts each element from 86400 from `t` until `t` becomes non-positive. The function then prints the total number of elements in the list `a`. The function does not return any specific value. It is missing a condition to handle the case where the loop runs out of elements in `a` before `t` becomes non-positive, which could lead to an index out of range error.**
