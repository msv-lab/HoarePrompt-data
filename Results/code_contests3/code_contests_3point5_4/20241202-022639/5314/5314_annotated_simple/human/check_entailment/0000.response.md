Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program does not take into account the fact that Luba can spend any remaining time on reading if she finishes her work early on any day. The program simply subtracts the time Luba spends working each day from the total time required to read the book without considering the possibility of finishing early on some days.

For example, if the input is:
```
2 2
86400 86398
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. Luba can actually finish reading on the first day itself because she only needs 2 seconds to finish the book and has 86400 seconds available on the first day.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for.
