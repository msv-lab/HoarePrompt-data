Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of days Luba can finish reading the book. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not consider the case where Luba has free time available to read on a particular day. Instead, it only subtracts the time spent working from the total reading time, which may not give the correct result.

For example, if the input is:
```
2 2
86400 86398
```
The correct output should be 2, as Luba can finish reading on the second day. However, the program will output 1 as it does not account for the free time Luba has on the first day.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
