Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1 for the next iteration of the loop, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1 for the next iteration of the loop, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above**
