According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^6. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
