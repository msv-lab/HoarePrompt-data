The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it utilizes the global variables `n`, `t`, and `ai` based on the specified constraints. The function does not return a specific value but performs some operations on the provided parameters `n`, `t`, and the list `ai`. The functionality of the function is to process the list `ai` containing `n` integers and perform certain operations based on the values of `t` and the elements in the list `ai`.
