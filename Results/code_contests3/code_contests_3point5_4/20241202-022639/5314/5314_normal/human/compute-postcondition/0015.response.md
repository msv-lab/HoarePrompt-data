Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `t`, as well as a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, subtracting each element from `t` until `t` becomes non-positive. The function prints the index `i` at which `t` becomes non-positive. The function does not explicitly return a value but processes the input data accordingly. It is assumed that the elements in the list `ai` are being accessed correctly within the loop, but missing error handling for out-of-bounds access is a potential issue.**
