Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and split based on spaces, resulting in a list of strings `a`. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; ai contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; ai contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400**
