Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `a`. The value of `t` can potentially become negative depending on the value of `a[i]`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above**
