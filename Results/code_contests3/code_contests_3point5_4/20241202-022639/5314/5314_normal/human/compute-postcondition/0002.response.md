Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. There are no other variables affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400. `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400. `i` is 0**
