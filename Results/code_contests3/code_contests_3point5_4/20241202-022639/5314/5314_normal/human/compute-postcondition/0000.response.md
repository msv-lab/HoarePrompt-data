Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values by mapping the input integers separated by a space. The values of `n` and `t` are limited by the constraints mentioned. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each integer ai is non-negative and less than or equal to 86400.
Output State: **n and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^6. The list ai contains n integers where each integer ai is non-negative and less than or equal to 86400.**
