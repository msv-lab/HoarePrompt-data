Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decreased by 86400 - `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is one of the elements in the list `ai`. Since the initial state of `t` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 86400, the value of `t` will be updated accordingly based on the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1 for the next iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1 for the next iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
