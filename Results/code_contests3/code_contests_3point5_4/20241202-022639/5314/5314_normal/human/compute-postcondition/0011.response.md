Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by the result of 86400 - `ai[i]`, where `ai[i]` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 86400. After that, `i` is incremented by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is the next integer for the loop to execute again, and `t` is decremented by the result of 86400 - `ai[i]`**
