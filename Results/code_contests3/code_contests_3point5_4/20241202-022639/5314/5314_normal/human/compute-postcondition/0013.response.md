Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(i)` simply outputs the value of variable `i`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `i`, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is greater than the number of elements in `ai`**
