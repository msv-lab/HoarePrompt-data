The loop will continue until `t` becomes less than or equal to 0. At that point, `i` will hold a value greater than the number of elements in `ai`. The loop will stop when the condition `t > 0` is no longer met.

Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is greater than the number of elements in `ai`**
