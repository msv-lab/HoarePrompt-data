According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is 1 for the next iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 0**
