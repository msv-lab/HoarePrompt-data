Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so after execution, `i` will be increased by 1. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is the next integer for the loop to execute again, and `t` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `t` <= 10^6; `ai` contains n non-negative integers less than or equal to 86400, `i` is the next integer for the loop to execute again, and `t` is greater than 0**
