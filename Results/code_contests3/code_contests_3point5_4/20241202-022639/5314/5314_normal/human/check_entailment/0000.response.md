Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the code iterates through the list of time Luba has to spend working each day and subtracts each element from `t` until `t` becomes non-positive. However, the code does not handle the case when Luba finishes reading the book exactly at the end of a day. 

For example, if the input is:
```
2 86400
0 86400
```
The expected output should be `1` because Luba finishes reading the book on the first day. However, the code will output `2` because it does not account for the case where Luba finishes reading exactly at the end of a day.
