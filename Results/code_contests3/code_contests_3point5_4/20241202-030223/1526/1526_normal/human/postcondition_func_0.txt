The function `func_1` reads a non-empty user input string `s`, calculates the frequency of each unique character in the string, and then checks if all character frequencies are even. It then prints 'Yes' if all frequencies are even, otherwise 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the global variable `w`, which is a string consisting of lowercase letters.
