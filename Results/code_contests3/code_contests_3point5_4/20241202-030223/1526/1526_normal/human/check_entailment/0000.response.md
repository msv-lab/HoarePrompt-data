Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It reads a non-empty user input string `s`, calculates the frequency of each unique character in the string, and then checks if all character frequencies are even. It then prints 'Yes' if all frequencies are even, otherwise 'No'. The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear summary of the code functionality. Thus, the code is correct and provides the expected output for all cases.
