According to the code, the loop can execute again unless all characters in string `s` have been iterated over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, and `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in string `s` needs to be processed and added to the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1**
