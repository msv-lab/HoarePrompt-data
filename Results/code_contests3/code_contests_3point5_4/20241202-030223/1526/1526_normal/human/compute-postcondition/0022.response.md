According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values in the dictionary, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `result` is True. If `x` is an odd integer, the loop breaks out and `result` becomes False. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more values in the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with more than 1 key-value pair, `result` is True**
