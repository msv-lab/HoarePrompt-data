Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, then the function assigns `memo[c]` the value 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
