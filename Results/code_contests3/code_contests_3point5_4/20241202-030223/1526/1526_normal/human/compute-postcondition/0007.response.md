According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the first character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1**.
