Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input from the user. Since the initial state mentions `w is a string consisting of lowercase letters`, the only change is the addition of variable `s` with user input.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string**
