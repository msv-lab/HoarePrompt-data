According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary `memo` has at least 1 key-value pair, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, it is not guaranteed that the loop will execute, so the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can run. For the loop to execute, one possible adjustment is to have the dictionary `memo` contain at least 1 key-value pair.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time**
