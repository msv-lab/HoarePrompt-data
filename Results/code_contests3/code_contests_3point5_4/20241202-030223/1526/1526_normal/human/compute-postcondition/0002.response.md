According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the input string `s` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the string `w` is irrelevant to the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `s` is not empty, and `c` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in string `s`**
