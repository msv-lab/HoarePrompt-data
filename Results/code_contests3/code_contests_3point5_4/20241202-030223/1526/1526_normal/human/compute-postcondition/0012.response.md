Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. If `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1, then `memo[c]` is updated to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s` and `c` is not in `memo` with `memo[c]` being assigned the value 1**
