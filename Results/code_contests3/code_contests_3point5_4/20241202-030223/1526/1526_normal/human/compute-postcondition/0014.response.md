Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1, where `c` is the next character in string `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, it is assigned the value 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s`, and if `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is assigned the value 1, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where `c` is the next character in string `s`, and if `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` is assigned the value 1, and `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**
