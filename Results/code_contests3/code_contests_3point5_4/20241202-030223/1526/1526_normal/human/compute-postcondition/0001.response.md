Example Answer: 
A dictionary named `memo` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `w` and `s` remain unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is the user input string, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
