Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False. The value of `result` is False if any of the values in `memo` are odd. Therefore, after running the code, the output will be 'Yes' if any character in string `s` has an odd frequency, otherwise it will be 'No'.
Output State: **'Yes' if any character in string `s` has an odd frequency, otherwise 'No'**
