Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the boolean value `True`. Since none of the other variables are affected by this assignment, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where each unique character in string `s` is a key in `memo` with its corresponding value being the frequency of that character in the string `s`, `result` is True.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty user input string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where each unique character in string `s` is a key in `memo` with its corresponding value being the frequency of that character in the string `s`, `result` is True**
