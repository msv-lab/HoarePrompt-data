Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string, counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter, and then checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If all letters occur even number of times, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it handles all potential cases correctly.
