Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads a string `s` as input, constructs a dictionary `memo` where each key represents a unique character in `s` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character. Then, it checks if all frequencies in `memo` are even, and prints 'Yes' if they are, otherwise 'No'. This aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description, which states that a string is beautiful if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times. The program handles all cases and outputs the correct result.
