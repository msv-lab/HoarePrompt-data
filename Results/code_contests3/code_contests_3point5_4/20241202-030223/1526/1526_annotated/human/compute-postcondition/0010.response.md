Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, a new key-value pair `c: 0` is added to `memo` before the increment operation. The initial value of `memo[c]` is 1 as per the initial state. After execution, `memo[c]` will be 2.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 2, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `c` is the next character in string `s`.**
