Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the user as a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters. It then constructs a dictionary `memo` where each key represents a unique character in `s` and the corresponding value is the frequency of that character. After that, it checks if all frequencies in `memo` are even, and prints 'Yes' if they are, otherwise 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
