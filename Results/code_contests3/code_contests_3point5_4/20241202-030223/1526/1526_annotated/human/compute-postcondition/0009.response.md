Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `c` is the next character in string `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then the key-value pair `c: 0` is added to `memo`.***
