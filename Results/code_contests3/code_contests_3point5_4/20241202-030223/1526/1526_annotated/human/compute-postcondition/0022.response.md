According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is either True or False. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more value in the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two values, `result` is either True or False**
