According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters remaining in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in string `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then the key-value pair `c: 0` is added to `memo`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- The string `s` should have more characters remaining to iterate over.
- The character `c` should be the next character in the string `s`.
- If the next character `c` is not already in `memo`, then the key-value pair `c: 0` should be added to `memo`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 1, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `c` is the next character in string `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then the key-value pair `c: 0` is added to `memo**.
