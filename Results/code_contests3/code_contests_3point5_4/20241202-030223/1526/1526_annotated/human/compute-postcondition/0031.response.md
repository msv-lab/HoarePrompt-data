Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if the value of `result` is True, otherwise it prints 'No'. The value of `result` is True if all values in `memo` (representing the frequency of characters in `w`) are even, otherwise it is False. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with values representing the frequency of characters in `w`, `result` is True if all values in `memo` are even, otherwise False.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with values representing the frequency of characters in `w`, `result` is True if all values in `memo` are even, otherwise False**
