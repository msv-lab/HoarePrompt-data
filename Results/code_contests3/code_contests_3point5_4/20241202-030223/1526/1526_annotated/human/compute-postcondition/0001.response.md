Example Answer:
The dictionary `memo` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since the variable `w` is not mentioned in the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
