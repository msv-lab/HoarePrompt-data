Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is in `memo`, then its value will increase by 1. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo` will have the key `c` with a value of 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 3. 
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having a value of 3**
