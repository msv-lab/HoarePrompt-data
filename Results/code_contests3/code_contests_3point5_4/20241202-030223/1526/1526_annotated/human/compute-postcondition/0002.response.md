According to the code, the loop can execute if the string `s` is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character in the string `s`. Additionally, since `memo` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the execution of the loop.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in the string `s`**
