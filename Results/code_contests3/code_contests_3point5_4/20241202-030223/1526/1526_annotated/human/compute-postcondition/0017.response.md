According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary `memo` has at least one value, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the `result` being True does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to be executed the first time, `memo` must have at least one value and `x` should be the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in `memo`**
