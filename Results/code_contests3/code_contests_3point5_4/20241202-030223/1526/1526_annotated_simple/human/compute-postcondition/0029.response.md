Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s` with at least 1 value. If `x` % 2 > 0, `result` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `result` remains True and the program continues executing without any changes.***
