Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `memo[c]` is 0, so after execution, `memo[c]` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1**
