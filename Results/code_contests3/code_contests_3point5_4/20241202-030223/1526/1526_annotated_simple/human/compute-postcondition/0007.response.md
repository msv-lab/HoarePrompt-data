According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the dictionary `memo`. If there are more characters left in the string `s` to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the string `s` to iterate over and the next character in `s` must have `memo` value of 1.
State: **`s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1**
