Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `s` (string) and `memo` (dictionary) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s`, `result` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s`, `result` is True**
