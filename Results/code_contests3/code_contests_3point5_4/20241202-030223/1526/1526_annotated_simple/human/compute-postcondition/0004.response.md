Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The character `c` is the first character in the string `s`, which means `memo` is updated with the key `c` and value 0. The Output State is: `s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in the string `s`, and `memo[c]` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in the string `s`, `memo[c]` is 0**
