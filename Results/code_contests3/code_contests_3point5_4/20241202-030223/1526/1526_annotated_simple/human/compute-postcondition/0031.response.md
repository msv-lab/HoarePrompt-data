Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, and 'No' if `result` is False. The value of `result` is determined by checking if any value in the `memo` dictionary is odd. If any value in `memo` is odd, `result` is False; otherwise, `result` is True. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s` with at least 1 value. If any value in `memo` is odd, `result` is False; otherwise, `result` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s` with at least 1 value. If any value in `memo` is odd, `result` is False; otherwise, `result` is True**
