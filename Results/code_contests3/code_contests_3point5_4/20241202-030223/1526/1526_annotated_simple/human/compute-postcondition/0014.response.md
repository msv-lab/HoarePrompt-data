Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was previously in `memo`, then `memo[c]` will be updated accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo`, otherwise `memo[c]` is updated to 1 if `c` is not in `memo`.
Output State: **`s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo`, otherwise `memo[c]` is updated to 1 if `c` is not in `memo`**
