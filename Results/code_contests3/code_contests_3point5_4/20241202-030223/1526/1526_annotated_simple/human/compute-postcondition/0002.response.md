According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the input string `s` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `s` being the input string provided by the user does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not empty. Additionally, since `memo` is an empty dictionary at the start, we need to update it to indicate that `c` is the first character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is not empty, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the first character in the string `s`**
