Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s` with at least 1 value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in `memo`. If `x` is the first value in `memo` and `x` is an odd number, the function sets `result` to False, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
