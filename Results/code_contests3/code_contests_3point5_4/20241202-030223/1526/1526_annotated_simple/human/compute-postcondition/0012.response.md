Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. If `c` was previously in `memo`, its value will be updated to 0. If `c` was not in `memo`, it will be added to `memo` with a value of 0. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo` else `memo[c]` is updated to 0.
Output State: **`s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo` else `memo[c]` is updated to 0**
