According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 1 value, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed, the dictionary `memo` must have at least 1 value, and `x` is the first value in the dictionary.
State: **`s` is a string, `memo` is a dictionary containing the count of each character in `s` with at least 1 value, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in `memo`**
