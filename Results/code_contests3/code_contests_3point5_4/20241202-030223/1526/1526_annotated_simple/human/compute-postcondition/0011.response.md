According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `memo`. If there are more characters left in `s` to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has more characters to iterate over and `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo` else `memo[c]` is updated to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in `s` to iterate over and the next character in `s` must be processed in `memo`.
State: **`s` has more characters to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with the next character in `s` where `memo[c]` is 1 if `c` was previously in `memo` else `memo[c]` is updated to 1**
