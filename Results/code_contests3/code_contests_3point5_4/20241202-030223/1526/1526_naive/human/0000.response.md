Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string and creates a dictionary `memo` to store the count of each character in the string. It then iterates through the values of the dictionary and checks if any of them have an odd count. If any character has an odd count, it sets the `result` to False, indicating that the string is not beautiful. Otherwise, it sets the `result` to True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, indicating that the string is beautiful, and 'No' otherwise.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly determines if a given string is beautiful based on the condition provided.
