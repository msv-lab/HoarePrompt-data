Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, sorts the passengers based on their floor in descending order, and simulates the elevator's movement accordingly. It calculates the time taken to bring all passengers to floor 0 and prints the result, which matches the problem description. The logic of the program seems to handle all potential cases and there are no obvious issues that would cause it to fail for any input.
