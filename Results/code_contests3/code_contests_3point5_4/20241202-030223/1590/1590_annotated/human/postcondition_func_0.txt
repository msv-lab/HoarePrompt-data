The function `func` reads input for the number of passengers `n` and floors `s`, then simulates an elevator system with `n` passengers and `s` floors. It sorts the passengers based on their destination floors and calculates the total time taken for all passengers to reach their respective floors, considering the elevator moving between floors and stopping according to passenger arrival times. However, the final output state after the simulation loop cannot be determined without additional context, making it unclear if the calculated time is accurate.
