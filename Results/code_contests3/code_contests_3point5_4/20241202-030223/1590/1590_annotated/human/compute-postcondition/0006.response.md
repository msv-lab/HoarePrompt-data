Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by whitespace. The variables `n`, `s`, `p`, `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `n`**
