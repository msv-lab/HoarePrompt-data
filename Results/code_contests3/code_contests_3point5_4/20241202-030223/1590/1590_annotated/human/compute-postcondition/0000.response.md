Example Answer: 
`n` and `s` are assigned values from the input split by space. Since the input values are within the specified ranges, `n` will be between 1 and 100, and `s` will be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
