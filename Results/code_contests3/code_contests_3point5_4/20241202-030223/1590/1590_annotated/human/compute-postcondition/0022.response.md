Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` and an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is incremented by 1, `time_passed` is updated with the value of `s - p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then the program state remains unchanged.**
