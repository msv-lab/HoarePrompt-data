Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the tuple `p`. The previous values of `p` contained tuples, and now it has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`**
