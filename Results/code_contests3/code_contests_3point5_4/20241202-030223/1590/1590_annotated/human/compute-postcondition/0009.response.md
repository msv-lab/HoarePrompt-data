Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is taken from the user, the values of `fi` and `ti` can vary. The output state shows that `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`**
