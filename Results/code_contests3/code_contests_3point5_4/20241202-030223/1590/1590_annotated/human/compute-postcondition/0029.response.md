Example Answer: 
The value of `time_passed` is updated based on the value of `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. Without knowing the initial values of `time_passed` and `p[i][1]`, the final output state cannot be accurately determined.
Output State: **The final output state cannot be determined accurately without the initial state and full loop conditions**
