According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` and an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is incremented by 1, `time_passed` is updated with the value of `s - p[i][0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n+1`.**
