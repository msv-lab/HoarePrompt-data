The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for simulating an elevator system with `n` passengers and `s` floors. Each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti` are randomly generated within the specified constraints. The function will simulate the elevator picking up passengers and moving between floors based on the passengers' arrival times and destinations. The return value of the function could be the total time taken for all passengers to reach their respective floors.
