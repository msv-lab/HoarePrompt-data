According to the code, the loop will execute `n+1` times. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is now 0
- `time_passed` is 0
- `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` and an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end
- `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` and an additional tuple `(0, 0)` at the end, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is 0, `time_passed` is 0**
