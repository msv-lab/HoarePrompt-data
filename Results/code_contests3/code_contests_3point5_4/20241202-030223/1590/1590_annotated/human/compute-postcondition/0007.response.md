Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The size of list `p` increases by 1 due to the appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `p` has an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`**
