Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program description states that the elevator can only move down and has infinite capacity, but the code does not account for the time it takes to move between floors and pick up passengers. The code only calculates the time passed based on the floors of the passengers and does not consider the time it takes to actually move between floors and pick up passengers. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not accurately represent the scenario described in the problem.
