Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values by mapping the input to integers. The values of `n` and `s` are now determined by the input split by spaces. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
