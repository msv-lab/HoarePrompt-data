Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, a tuple (0, 0) is appended to the list `p`, `time_passed` is increased by `s - p[i][0]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute `n + 1` times.**
