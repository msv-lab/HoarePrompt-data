Example Answer:
`p` is appended with a tuple `(fi, ti)`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not specified in the initial state, so after execution, `p` will contain one tuple with unknown values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple with unknown values, `fi` is an integer value, `ti` is an integer value.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple with unknown values, `fi` is an integer value, `ti` is an integer value**
