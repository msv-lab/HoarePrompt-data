According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` will be one more than the previous iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains at least one tuple with unknown values, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n+1`**
