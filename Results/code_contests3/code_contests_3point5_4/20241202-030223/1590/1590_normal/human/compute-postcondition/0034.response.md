Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for `n` and `s`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000. It then reads `n` pairs of integers and sorts them in descending order based on the first element of the tuples. After that, it calculates the time passed based on the values stored in the pairs. The function does not have a return value and prints the total accumulated time at the end.**
