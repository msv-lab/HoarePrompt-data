Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input after mapping them to integers. The loop condition for `i` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains at least one tuple with unknown values, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n+1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains at least one tuple with unknown values, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers, for the loop to execute another time `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n+1**
