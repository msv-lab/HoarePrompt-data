Example Answer:
The list of tuples `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The specific values of the tuples in `p` are unknown, but the sorting order is reversed. Therefore, after execution, `p` will be sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers**
