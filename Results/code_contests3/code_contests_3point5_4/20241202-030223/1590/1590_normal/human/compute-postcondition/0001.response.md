Example Answer:
`p` is initialized as an empty list. Since the values of `n` and `s` are not used in this snippet, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list**
