According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is increased by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains one tuple with unknown values, `fi` is an integer value, `ti` is an integer value**
