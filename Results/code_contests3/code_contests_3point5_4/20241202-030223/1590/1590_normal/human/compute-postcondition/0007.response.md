Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is created and appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are mapped to integers from the input, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains at least one tuple with unknown values, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains at least one tuple with unknown values, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input after mapping them to integers**
