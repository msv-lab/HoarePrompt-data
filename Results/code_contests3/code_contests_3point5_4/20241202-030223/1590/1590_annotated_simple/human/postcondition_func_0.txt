The function `func` reads input details of arrival floor and time for each passenger, processes them, and calculates the total time passed based on certain conditions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The function sorts the passengers based on their arrival floor in descending order, simulates their movement, and calculates the total time passed. The code implements the logic described in the annotations regarding time calculations and sorting passengers.
