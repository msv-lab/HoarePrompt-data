Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `time_passed` has been updated accordingly, `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, the program maintains the initial conditions.***
