According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1 and `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
