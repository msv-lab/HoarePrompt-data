Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`. If `time_passed < p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is incremented by the difference of `s` and the largest `fi` from the tuple at index `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `s` is updated to the value of `fi` from the tuple at index `i`, `time_passed` is incremented by `p[i][1] - time_passed`, and `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1`.***
