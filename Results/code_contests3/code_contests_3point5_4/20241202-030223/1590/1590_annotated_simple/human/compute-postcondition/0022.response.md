Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `s` and the first element of the `i`-th tuple in list `p`. The value of `i` is 1, so it accesses the first tuple in the list. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `time_passed` is the previous value of `time_passed` plus `s` minus the first element of the first tuple in list `p`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `time_passed` has been updated accordingly.**
