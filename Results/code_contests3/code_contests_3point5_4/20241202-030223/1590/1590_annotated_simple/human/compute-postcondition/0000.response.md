Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. The values of `n` and `s` are constrained between 1 and 100, and 1 and 1000 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
