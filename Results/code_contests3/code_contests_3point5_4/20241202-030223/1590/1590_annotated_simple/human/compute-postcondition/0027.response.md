Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `s` and the first value of the `i-th` tuple in `p` to its current value. Since `i` is 2, we take the tuple at index 2 (which is the third tuple since indexing starts from 0) in `p`. Therefore, `time_passed` is updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `time_passed` has been updated accordingly**
