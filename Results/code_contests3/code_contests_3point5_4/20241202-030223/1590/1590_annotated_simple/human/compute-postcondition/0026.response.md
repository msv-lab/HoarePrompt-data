According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, and `time_passed` has been updated accordingly. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that `i` becomes 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, `time_passed` has been updated accordingly**.
