Example Answer:
A tuple `(0, 0)` is appended to the list `p`. Since `p` already contained `n` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, the list `p` now contains `n+1` tuples. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.**
