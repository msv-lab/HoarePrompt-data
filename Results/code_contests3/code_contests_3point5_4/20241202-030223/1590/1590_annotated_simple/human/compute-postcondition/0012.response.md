Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The previous state of `p` contained `n` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers. After sorting, the list `p` is rearranged in descending order based on the first element of each tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple**
