Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown since they depend on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
