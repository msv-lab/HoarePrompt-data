The code snippet updates the `time_passed` variable by subtracting the current value of `time_passed` from the second value of the tuple at index `i` in the list `p`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` greater than 0, `s` between 1 and 1000, `p` containing `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` equal to 1, and `time_passed` updated accordingly. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `time_passed` has been updated accordingly**
