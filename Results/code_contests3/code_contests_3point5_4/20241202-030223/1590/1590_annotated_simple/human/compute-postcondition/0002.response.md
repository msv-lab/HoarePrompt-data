According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
