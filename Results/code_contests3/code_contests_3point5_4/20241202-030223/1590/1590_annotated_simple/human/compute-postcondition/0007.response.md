Example Answer:
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
