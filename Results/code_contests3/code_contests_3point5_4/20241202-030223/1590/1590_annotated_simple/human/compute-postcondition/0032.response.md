Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(time_passed)` will output the value stored in the variable `time_passed`. The values of `s` and `p` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `time_passed` will be the total time passed based on the calculations made within the loop, `s` will be the value of the last `fi` encountered in the loop, `p` will remain the same as the initial state with `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)`, and the value of `time_passed` will be printed.
