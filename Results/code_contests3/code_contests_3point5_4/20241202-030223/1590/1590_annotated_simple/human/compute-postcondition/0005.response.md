According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should still be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
