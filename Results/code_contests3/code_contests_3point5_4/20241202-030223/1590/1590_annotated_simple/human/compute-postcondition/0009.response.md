Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned values by mapping the integers obtained from the user input split by space. The values of `fi` and `ti` depend on user input. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
