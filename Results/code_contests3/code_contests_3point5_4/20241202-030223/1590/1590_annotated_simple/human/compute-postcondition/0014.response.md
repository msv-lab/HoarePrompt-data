Example Answer:
`time_passed` is initialized to 0. There are no changes to other variables based on this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integers, sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `time_passed` is 0**
