Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: *`N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, `i`, `j` are positive integers within specified ranges.
Output State: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, `i`, `j` are positive integers within specified ranges***
