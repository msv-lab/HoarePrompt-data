Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` depends on the initial state and previous calculations. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the given calculation.**
