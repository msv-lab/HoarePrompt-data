According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
