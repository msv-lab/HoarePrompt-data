Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues without any change in variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is assigned an integer value, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`dp` is updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is assigned an integer value, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0**
