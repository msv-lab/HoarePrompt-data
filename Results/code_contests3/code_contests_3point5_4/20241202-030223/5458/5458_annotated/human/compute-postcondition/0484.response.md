Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished. The final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will depend on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` throughout the loop execution.**
