Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial conditions of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
