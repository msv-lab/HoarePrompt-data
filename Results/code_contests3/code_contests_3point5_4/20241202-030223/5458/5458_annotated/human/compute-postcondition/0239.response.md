Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged, and the value of `mod` is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same**
