Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. The loop will execute `m` times. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned as 1 in each iteration. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` in each iteration.**
