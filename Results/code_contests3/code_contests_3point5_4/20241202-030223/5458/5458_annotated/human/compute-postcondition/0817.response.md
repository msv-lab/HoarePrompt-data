Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1. The loop executes for the first time with `s` being greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, then after the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions mentioned in the else part.***
