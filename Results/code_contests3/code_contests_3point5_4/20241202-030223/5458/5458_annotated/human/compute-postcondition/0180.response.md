Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated based on loop calculations. Values in the `dp` array are finalized. The loop has executed at least once with `s` greater than 0 and `j` equals 1. `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is assigned the value 1.***
