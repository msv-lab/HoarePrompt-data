Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is `k + 1`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, and the program state is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j > k`, the overall state of the program remains the same, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed.**
