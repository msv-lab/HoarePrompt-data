Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since no specific values are given for `i`, `j`, and `k`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time either `i == 0 and j >= k` or `i != 0 and j > k` condition must be satisfied, and the assignment operation described above has taken place.**
