Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. All other variables retain their initial values. 
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the code snippet. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` retain their initial conditions. `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute. `i` is not equal to 0.**
