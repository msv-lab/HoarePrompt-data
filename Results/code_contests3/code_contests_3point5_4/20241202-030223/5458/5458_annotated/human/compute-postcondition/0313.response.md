Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous value of `dp[n]` is unknown and not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dp[n]` remains unchanged; `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **The value of `dp[n]` remains unchanged; `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input.**
