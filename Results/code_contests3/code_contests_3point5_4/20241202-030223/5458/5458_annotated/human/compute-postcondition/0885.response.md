Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
