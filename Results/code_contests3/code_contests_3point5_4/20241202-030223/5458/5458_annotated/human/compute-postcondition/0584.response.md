Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is adjusted based on the conditions. If j >= k, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the program state is updated according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
