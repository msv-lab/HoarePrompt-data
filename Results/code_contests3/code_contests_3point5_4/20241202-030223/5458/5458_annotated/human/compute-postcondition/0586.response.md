According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m + 2`.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2**
