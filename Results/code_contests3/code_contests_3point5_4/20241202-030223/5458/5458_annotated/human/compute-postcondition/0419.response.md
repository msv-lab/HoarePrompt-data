According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` and `i` is incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` and `i` are incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
