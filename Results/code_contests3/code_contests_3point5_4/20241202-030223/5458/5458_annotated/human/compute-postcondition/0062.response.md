Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time either `i == 0 and j >= k` or `i != 0 and j > k` condition must be satisfied, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute one more time with the updated values. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
