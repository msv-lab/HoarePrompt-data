According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state must be adjusted so that `j` is increased by 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1` are the same, `k` is the same, `s` is the same, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 0**
