Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.
