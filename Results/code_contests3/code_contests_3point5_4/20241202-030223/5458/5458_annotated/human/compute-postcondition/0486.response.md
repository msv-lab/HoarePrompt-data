According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished, it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. 
State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
