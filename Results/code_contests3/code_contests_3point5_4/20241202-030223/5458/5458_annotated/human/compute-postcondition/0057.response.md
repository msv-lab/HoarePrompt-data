Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within specified ranges. `s` is at least 1. `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, either `i == 0 and j >= k` or `i != 0 and j > k` condition must be satisfied. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
