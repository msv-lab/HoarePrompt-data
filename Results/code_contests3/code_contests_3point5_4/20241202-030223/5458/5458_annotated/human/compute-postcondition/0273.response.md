Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, so the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will depend on the values of `dp[0][0][0]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by 1, values of `dp` are updated, and `j` is compared to `k`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by 1, values of `dp` are updated, and `j` is compared to `k**.
