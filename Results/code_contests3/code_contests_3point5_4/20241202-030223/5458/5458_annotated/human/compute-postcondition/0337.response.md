Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0. `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input. `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input. `i` is 0. `j` is 1. `k` is 2. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program remains in the current state without any changes.***
