Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the next loop iteration if `s` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the next loop iteration if `s` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`**
