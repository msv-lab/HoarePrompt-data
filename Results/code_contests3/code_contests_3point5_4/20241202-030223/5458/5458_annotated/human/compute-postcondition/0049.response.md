Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, s is at least 1, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. i is not equal to 0, as the program did not enter the if block. Additionally, j is greater than k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
