Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `k` is s + 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`. If `j` is greater than `s + 1`, the program continues without any changes. After executing the code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
