According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. Since the loop is iterating over `k`, for the next iteration `k` needs to be updated to the next value. 
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the loop to execute the next time `s` is greater than 0**
