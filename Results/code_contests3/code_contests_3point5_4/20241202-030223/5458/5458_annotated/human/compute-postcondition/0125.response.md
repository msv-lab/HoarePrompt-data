Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, and `m` have been updated based on the loop. Values in the `dp` array have been updated. For the loop to execute again, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on the loop, and `s` is still greater than 0. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now assigned the value 1.***
