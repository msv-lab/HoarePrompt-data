Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
