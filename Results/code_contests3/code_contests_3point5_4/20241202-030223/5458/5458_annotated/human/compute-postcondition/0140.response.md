Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, and `m` have been updated based on the loop. For the loop to execute again, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on the loop, and `s` is still greater than 0. The values in the `dp` array are updated accordingly. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the values in the `dp` array are updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After the execution of the if else block, the program state is maintained for the next iteration with the specified variable updates in place. In the else part, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, and `m` have been updated. `j` is set to 1, and `k` is updated accordingly. For the loop to run again, `s` must be greater than 0. The values in the `dp` array are adjusted. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
