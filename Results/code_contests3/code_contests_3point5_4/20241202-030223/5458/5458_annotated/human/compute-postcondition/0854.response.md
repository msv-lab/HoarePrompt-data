Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This means the value 1 is assigned to the specific index in the `dp` array. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers**
