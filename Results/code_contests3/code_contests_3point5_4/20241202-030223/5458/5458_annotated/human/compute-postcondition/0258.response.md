Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
