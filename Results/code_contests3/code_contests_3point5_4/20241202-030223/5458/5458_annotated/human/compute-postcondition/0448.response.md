Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 4, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 4 for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i` is 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop or condition continues.**
