Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 0, the updated value of i becomes 1. j remains 1, and k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1. The value of s is greater than 0, so the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0**
