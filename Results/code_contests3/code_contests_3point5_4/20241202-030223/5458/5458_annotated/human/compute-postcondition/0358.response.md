Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.***
