Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input**
