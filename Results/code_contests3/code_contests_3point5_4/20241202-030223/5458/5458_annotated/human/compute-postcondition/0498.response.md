Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value of 1 based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After entering the if condition where `i` is equal to 0, the program state remains the same as the precondition. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` will be set to 1. In the else part, all variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed.***
