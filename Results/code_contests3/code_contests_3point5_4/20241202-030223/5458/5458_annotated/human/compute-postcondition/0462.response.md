Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], which is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition (j > k), the program state is as described.***
