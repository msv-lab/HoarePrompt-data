Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program retains the initial state without any changes.**
