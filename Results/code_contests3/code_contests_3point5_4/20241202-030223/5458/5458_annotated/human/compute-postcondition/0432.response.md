Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any change in values.***
