Postcondition: ***`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the program to continue without any changes. Otherwise, `k` must be within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues based on the conditions specified without any changes to the initial state variables.***
