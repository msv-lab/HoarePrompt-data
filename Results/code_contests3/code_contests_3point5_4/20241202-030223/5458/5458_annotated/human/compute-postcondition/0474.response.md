Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes as specified above. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described***
