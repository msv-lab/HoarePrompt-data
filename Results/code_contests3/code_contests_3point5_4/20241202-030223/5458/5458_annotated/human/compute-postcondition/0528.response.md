Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` is not specified, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` should be less than `j`, and `i` should not be equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
