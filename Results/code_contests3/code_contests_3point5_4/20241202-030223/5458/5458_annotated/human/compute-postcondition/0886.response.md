According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
