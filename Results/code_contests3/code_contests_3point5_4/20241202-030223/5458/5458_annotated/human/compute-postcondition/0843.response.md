Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then after executing the code, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
