According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Since all variables remain the same after the loop finishes and if the loop does not execute, all variables will retain their initial values, the initial state does not need to be adjusted. 
State: **No adjustments needed, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
