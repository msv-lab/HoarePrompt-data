Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions**
