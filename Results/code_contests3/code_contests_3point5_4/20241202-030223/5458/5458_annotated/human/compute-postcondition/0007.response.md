According to the code, the loop will execute `n^2` times. So for the loop to execute, N must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, so they are already in valid states. However, to satisfy the loop condition, i should be 0.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0 for the loop to execute**
