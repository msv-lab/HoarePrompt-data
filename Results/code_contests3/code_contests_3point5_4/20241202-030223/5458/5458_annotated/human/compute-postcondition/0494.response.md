Example Answer:
The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it continues to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, it specifies that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed, given the conditions provided. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed, given that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed, given that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
