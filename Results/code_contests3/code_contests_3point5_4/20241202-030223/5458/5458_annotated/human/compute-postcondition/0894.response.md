Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 2][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s.` Now, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Finally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
