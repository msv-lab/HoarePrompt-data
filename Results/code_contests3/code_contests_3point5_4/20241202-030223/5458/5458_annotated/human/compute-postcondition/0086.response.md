Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the final values of `dp` cannot be determined accurately. 
Output State: **Cannot determine final values accurately due to unknown initial values of `i`, `j`, `k`**
