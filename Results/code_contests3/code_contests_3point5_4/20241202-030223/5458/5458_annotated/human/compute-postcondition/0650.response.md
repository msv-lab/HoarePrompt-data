Postcondition: ***`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value within the range 1 to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, after incrementing `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Moreover, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
