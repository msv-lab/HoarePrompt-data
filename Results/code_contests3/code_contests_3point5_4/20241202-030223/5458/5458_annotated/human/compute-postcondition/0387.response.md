Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to 0. When the condition `(j >= k)` is true, the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
