Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are updated based on loop calculations. `k` is 2, `s` is updated based on loop calculations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
