Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are all known to be 1, 1, and the next value in the range from 1 to s+1 respectively. There is no change in the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, s is greater than 0 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.
