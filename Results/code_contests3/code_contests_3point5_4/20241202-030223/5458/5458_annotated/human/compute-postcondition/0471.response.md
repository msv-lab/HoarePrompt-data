Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if i is equal to 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. If j > k, the program retains its initial state with the exception of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` being set to 1 in the case where i is 0 and s is greater than or equal to 2.***
