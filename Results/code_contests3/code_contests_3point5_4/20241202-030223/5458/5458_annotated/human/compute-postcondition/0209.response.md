According to the code, the loop will execute `n**2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` will be updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the `dp` array will also be finalized. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` should be updated based on the loop logic for the next iteration.

State: **Adjust the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` based on the loop logic for the next iteration to execute the loop one more time**
