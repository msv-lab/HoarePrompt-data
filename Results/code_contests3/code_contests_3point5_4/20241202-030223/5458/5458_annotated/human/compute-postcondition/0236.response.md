Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are the same, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same**
