According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s`. The loop modifies the values of `dp` based on certain conditions. To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be less than `s + 1`.**
