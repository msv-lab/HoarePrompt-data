Postcondition: ***N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If i == 0, then N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is 1, and s is greater than 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then i is updated to 1; otherwise, i remains 0. If i != 0, then N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, and dp[1][j + 1][k] is updated for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0.***
