Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if i is equal to 0. The loop executes for the first time when `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the execution of the if else block, the state of the program variables remains the same except for the specified updates to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions mentioned in the if and else parts.***
