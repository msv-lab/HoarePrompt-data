Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1. The final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be based on the calculations within the loop for all iterations.**
