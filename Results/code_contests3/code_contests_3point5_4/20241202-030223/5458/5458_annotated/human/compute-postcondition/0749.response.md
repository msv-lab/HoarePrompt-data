Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The initial state variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions.
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions.**
