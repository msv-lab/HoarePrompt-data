Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are all used in the assignment operation, so their values are incremented by 1. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
