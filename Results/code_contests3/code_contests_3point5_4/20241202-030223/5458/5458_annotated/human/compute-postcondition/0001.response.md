Since the `while` statement is `while 1:`, this is an infinite loop and will always execute. Therefore, the loop will definitely execute one more time without any adjustments to the states N, M, S, and mod.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000. mod is 100000**
