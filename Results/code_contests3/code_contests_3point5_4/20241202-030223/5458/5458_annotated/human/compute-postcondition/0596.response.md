Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with these unchanged conditions.***
