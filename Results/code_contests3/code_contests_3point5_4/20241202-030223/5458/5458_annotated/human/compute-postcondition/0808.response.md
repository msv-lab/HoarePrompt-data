Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1. The loop executes for the first time with `s` being greater than or equal to 1. `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.***
