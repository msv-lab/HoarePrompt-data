Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k + 1` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
