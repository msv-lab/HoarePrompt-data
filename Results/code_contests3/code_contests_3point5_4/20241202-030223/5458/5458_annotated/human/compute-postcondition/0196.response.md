Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The loop conditions ensure that the values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain within the specified limits. 
Output State: **Values in the `dp` array are updated based on the modulo operation. The loop conditions are maintained with `s > 0`, `j = 1`, and `i` not equal to 0.**
