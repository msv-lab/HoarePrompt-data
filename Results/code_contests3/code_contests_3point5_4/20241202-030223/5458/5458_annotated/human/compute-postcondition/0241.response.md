Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, all variables remain unchanged except for the value of `dp[i+1 & 1][j+1][k]` which is set to 1. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than `s+1`. If `i != 0`, all variables remain the same.***
