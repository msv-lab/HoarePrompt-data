According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, and `s` have been updated based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
