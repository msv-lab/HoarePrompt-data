Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 2`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0. The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
