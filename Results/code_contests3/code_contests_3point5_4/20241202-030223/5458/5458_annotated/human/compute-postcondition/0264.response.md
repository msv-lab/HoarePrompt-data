Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated accordingly. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
