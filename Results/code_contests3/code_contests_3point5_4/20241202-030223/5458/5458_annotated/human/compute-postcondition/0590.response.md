Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the updated `dp` value.
Output State: **Postcondition: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
