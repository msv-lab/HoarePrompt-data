Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges, s is at least 1, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If i == 0 and j >= k, the loop continues for one more iteration. Otherwise, the loop proceeds as usual. If i != 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. After running the provided Python code snippet, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod.***
