Example Answer: 
After running the given Python code snippet, the variable `mod` is assigned the value 100000. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000. mod is 100000**
