Functionality: **The function `func` reads input until it encounters a case where `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, at which point it breaks out of the loop. Within the loop, the function performs a series of calculations on the variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, and `s` based on the nested loops and conditions specified. The final output printed is the result of the calculations done on `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. The function does not have a specific return value mentioned, and it operates based on the constraints provided for the positive integers N, M, and S.**
