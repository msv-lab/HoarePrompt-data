Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, and `m` have been updated based on the loop. For the loop to execute again, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on the loop, and `s` is still greater than 0. The values in the `dp` array are updated accordingly. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the values in the `dp` array are updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. All other variables remain unchanged and the program state is retained for the next iteration.**
