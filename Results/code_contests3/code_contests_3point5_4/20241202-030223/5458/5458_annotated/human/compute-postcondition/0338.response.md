Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program remains in the current state without any changes.
