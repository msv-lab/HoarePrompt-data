Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After entering the if condition where `i` is equal to 0, the program state remains the same as the precondition.***
