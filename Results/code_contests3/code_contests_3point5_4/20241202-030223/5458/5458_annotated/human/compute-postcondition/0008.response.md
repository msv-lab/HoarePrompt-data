According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. Since m is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. However, the initial value of i is specified as 0 for the loop to execute, so i needs to be adjusted to 0.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1**
