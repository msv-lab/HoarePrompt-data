Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is affected by the operation `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
