Based on the loop logic, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are the same, `k` is the same, `s` is the same, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is increased by 1**
