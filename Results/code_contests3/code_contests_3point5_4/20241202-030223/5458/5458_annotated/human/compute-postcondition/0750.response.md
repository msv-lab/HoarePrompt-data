Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same. 
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions**.
