Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the same conditions are maintained. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
