State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `i`, `j+1`, and `s` have been updated based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
