Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. After entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.
