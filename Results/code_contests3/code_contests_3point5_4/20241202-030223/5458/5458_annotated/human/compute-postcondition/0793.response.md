Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
