Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is updated based on the loop parameters for the next iteration. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
