Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
