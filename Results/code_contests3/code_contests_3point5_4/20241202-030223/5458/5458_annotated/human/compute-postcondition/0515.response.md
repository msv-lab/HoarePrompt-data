Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state tells us that `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k + 1]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. After execution, the affected variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the calculation**
