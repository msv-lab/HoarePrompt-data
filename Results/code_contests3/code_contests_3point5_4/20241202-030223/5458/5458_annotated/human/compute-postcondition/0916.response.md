Example Answer:
If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. All other variables remain incremented by the total number of times the loop executed.
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k + 1` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
