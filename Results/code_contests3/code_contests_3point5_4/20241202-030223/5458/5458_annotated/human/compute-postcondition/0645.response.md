Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is incremented to the next value within the range 1 to `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions, and if `k` is incremented to the next value within the range 1 to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions, and if `k` is incremented to the next value within the range 1 to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
