According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1. `k` is s + 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`.**
