Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the overall state of the program remains the same, with the exception of the specific variable assignment mentioned above.***
