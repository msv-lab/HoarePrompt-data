Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, and `j` is increased by 1. If `j > k`, the assignment of `dp` values as described is performed.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1. If `j > k`, the assignment of `dp` values as described is performed.**
