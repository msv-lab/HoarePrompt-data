Postcondition: ***`s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 1, all variables are incremented by 1. If `j` >= `k`, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition that `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` > `k` and `i` is equal to 1, all variables are incremented by 1. If `j` >= `k`, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
