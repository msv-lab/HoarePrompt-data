Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `k` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `k` is in the range 1 to `S`, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `k` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `k` is in the range 1 to `S`, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
