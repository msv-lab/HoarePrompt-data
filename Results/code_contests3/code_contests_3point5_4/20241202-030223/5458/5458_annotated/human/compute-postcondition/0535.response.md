Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since the previous values of i, j, and k are unknown, the output state is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`**
