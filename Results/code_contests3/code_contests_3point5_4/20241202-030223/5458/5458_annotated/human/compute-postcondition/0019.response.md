Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the initial values of i, j, and k are specified, and the condition j > k is not met, all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0**
