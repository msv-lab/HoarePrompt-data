Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The variables `i`, `j`, `k` are incremented or adjusted accordingly. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is adjusted based on the conditions, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is adjusted based on the conditions, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
