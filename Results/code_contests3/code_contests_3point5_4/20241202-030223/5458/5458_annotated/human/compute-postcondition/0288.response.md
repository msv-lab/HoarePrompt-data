Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.
Output State: **`s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
