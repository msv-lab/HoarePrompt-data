Output State: **N, M, S, i, j, k, s will be updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the dp array will be finalized. For the loop to execute the first time, s is greater than 0 and j is 1. Additionally, i is not equal to 0. The condition (j > k) is true. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
