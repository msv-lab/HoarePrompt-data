Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be less than `s`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
