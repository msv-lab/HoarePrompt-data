Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated based on loop calculations. Values in the `dp` array are finalized. The loop has executed at least once with `s` greater than 0 and `j` equals 1. `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, then the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated based on loop calculations. Values in dp array will be finalized. For the loop to execute the first time, `s > 0` and `j = 1`. Additionally, `i != 0`. If the condition `(j > k)` is true, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo mod.***
