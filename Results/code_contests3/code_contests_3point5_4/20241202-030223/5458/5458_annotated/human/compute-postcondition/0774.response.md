Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.**
