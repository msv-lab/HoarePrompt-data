Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is used for this calculation. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.**
