Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is equal to 1 if `i == 0` or 0 if `i != 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. Additionally, if `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
