According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m+1`.

State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished.**
