According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **All variables remain the same after the loop finishes. If the loop does not execute, all variables will retain their initial values.**
