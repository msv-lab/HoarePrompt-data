Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `i`, `j+1`, and `s` have been updated based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. The condition `i == 0` is false. After the execution of the if statement, `j` is greater than `k` and the value in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
