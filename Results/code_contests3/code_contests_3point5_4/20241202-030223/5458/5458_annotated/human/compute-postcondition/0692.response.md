Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` is incremented by 1. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its original value.***
