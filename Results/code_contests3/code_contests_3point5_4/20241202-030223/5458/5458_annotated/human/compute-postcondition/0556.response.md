Postcondition: *`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1. The value of `i` is 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`*
