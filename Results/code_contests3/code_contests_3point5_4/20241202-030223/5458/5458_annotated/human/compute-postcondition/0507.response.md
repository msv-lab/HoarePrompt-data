Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value of 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If j >= k, the postcondition is as described. If j < k, the postcondition remains the same as the else part, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.***
