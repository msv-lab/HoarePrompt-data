Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` remains the same, and `k` is 2, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged. Therefore, after running the code, the Output State is: After the if-else block, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 2`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0.
