According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `j` is less than `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` remains 0
- `j` remains the same or is incremented
- `k` is incremented by 1
- The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given conditions
- All other variables remain unchanged

State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is either incremented or remains the same, `k` is incremented by 1, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop**
