Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in the assignment but their previous values are not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers**
