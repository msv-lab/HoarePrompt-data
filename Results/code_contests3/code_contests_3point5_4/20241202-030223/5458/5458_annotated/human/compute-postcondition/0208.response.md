Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` will be updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the `dp` array will be finalized according to the loop logic. If the loop does not execute at all, the variables will retain their initial values.**
