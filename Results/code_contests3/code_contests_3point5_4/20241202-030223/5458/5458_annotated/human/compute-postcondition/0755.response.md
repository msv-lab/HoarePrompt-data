Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The conditions for the program to continue without any changes are met. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions.
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions**
