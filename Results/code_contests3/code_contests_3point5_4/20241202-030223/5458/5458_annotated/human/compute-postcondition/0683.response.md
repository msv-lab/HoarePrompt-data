Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, and `i` retain their initial conditions for the next loop iteration. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the state of the variables. If `j` is less than `k` and `s` is greater than 0, the variables retain their initial conditions for the next iteration.***
