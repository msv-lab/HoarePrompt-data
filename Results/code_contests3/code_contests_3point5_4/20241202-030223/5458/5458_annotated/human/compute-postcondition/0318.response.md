According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `s`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
