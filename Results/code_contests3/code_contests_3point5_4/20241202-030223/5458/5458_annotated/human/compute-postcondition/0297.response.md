Output State: **All variables are incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned 1. If `j` is greater than `k` and `i` is not equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
