According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If i == 0, then N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0.**
