According to the code, the loop will execute for `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`.
