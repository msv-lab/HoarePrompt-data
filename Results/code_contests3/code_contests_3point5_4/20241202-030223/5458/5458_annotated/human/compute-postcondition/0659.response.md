Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions. `i` is adjusted according to the loop conditions. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If `i` is not 0, `dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions, `i` is adjusted according to the loop conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program retains the initial state of the variables and `i` is adjusted according to the loop conditions.***
