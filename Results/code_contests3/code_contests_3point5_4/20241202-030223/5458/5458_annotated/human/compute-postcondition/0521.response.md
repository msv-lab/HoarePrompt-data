According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
