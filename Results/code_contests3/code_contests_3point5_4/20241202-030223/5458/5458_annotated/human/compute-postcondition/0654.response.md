Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is adjusted based on the loop condition. 
Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions, `i` is adjusted according to the conditions described in the loop**
