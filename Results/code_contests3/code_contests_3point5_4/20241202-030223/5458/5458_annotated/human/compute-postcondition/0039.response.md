Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If i == 0, then N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If j >= k, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to S+1, and s is greater than 0. If i != 0, N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to S+1. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to S+1. If j > k in the else part, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to S+1.***
