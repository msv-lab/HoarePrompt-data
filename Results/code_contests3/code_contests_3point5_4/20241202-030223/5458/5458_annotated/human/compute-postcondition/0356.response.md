Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
