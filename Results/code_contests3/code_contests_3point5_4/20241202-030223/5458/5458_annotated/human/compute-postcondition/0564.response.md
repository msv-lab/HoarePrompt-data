Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not explicitly mentioned, so the resulting value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be determined accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is not equal to 0**
