Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. `i` is updated to `n`, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
