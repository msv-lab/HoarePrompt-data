Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k + 1` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation provided in the code snippet.**
