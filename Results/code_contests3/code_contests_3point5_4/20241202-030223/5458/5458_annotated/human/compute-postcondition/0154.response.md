Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Therefore, the output state is: The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
