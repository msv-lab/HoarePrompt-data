Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i, j, k` remain the same, and the loop continues if the conditions are met. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
