According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, so they need to be adjusted to `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is now 1.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1**
