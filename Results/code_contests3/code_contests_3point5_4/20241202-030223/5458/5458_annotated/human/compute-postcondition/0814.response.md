Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1. The loop continues to execute with `s` being greater than or equal to 1. `k` remains 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`.***
