According to the code, the loop can execute `m` times based on the value of `m`. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, and `k`, `i` are integers. To ensure the loop executes `m` times, `i` should be updated to `n`, `j` should range from 1 to `m`, and `k` should range from 1 to `s`. 
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are 1, `k`, `i` are integers, for the loop to execute `m` times `i` is updated to `n`, `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, `k` ranges from 1 to `s`**
