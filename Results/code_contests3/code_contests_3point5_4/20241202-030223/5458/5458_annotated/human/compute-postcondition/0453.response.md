According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the only variable that needs adjustment based on the conditions stated above is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **All variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
