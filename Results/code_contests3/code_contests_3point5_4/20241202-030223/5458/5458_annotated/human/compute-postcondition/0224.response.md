According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` are the same and `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to execute. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be less than `s+1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s+1`**
