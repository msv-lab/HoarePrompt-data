According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
