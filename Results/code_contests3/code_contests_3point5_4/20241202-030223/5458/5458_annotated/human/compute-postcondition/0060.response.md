Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time either `i == 0 and j >= k` or `i != 0 and j > k` condition must be satisfied, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute one more time with the updated values.***
