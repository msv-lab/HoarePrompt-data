According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 again. 
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 2**
