According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `i`, and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. To determine the states needed for the next iteration:
- If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.
- If i == 0 and j < k, no change occurs.
- If i != 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.
- If i != 0 and j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].

State: **All variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the conditions stated above**.
