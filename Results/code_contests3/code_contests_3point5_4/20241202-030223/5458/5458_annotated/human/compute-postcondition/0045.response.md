Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, s is at least 1, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. i is equal to 0. j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, s is at least 1, j is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. i is equal to 0. j is greater than or equal to k**
