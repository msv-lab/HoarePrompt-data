Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The initial state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. After the execution of the code, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` would change accordingly.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated.
