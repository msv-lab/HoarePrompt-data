Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0**
