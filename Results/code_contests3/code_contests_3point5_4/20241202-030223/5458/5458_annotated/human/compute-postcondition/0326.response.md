Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known and remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
