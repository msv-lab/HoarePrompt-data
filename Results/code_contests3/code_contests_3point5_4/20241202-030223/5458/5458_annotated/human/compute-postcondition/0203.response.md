Postcondition: ***The values in the `dp` array are updated based on the modulo operation if `j > k`, while maintaining the loop conditions with `s > 0`, `j = 1`, and `i` not equal to 0. If `i == 0`, the state remains the same. Otherwise, the values in the `dp` array are updated based on the modulo operation.***
