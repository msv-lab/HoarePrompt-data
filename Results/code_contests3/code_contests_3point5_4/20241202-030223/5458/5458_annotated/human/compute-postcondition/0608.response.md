Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged. `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values. `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1. `k` is 2. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i != 0`, the program retains the state where `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`.***
