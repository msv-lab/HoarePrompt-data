Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` can be either 0 or the total number of iterations of the loop, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the elements in the `dp` array are updated based on the calculations within the loop for all iterations.**
