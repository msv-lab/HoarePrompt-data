Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `(i != 0)`, `j` is greater than `k`, and the assignment mentioned above takes place.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `(i != 0)`, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
