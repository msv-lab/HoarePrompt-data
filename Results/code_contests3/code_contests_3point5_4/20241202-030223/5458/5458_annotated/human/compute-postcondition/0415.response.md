Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 4, `k` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be at least 1. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on a specific formula.***
