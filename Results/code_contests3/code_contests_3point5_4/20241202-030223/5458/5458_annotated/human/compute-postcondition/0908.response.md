Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and updated values of `dp` based on the calculations.
Output State: **All variables remain incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, updated values of `dp` based on the calculations**
