Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `S`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`.***
