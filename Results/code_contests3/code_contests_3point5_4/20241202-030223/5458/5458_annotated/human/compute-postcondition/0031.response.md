According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range from 1 to s, and s is greater than 0. For the next iteration to occur, k needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1.
State: **N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If i == 0, then N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. If j >= k, i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1, and s is greater than 0. If i != 0, N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1**.
