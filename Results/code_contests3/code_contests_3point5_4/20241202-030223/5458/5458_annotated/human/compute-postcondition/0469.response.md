Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is 1 when i is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if i is equal to 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the value 1 if i is equal to 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2**
