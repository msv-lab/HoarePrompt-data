Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, and `s` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same** `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.
