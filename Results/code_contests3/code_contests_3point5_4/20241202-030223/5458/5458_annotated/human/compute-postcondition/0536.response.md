Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program retains the initial state without any changes.***
