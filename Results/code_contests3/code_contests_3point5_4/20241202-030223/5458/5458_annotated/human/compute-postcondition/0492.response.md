Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
