Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
