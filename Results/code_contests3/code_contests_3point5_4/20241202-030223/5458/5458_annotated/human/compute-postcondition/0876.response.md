Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
