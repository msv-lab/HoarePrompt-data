According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp` is initialized correctly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 1 do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. 
State: **`dp` is initialized correctly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is assigned an integer value, for the loop to execute `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**
