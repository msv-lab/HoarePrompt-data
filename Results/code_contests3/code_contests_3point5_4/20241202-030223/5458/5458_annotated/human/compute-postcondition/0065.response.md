Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j > k` condition must be satisfied.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j > k` condition must be satisfied**
