Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 3`, `i + 2`, `k + 2` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. For the loop to execute another time, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 2. If `i + 1` is 0, `j + 1` must be greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i + 1` is not equal to 0, the updated values of `dp` are based on the calculations. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables maintain their incremented values and the conditions specified in the precondition. If `j + 1` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j + 1` is not greater than `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
