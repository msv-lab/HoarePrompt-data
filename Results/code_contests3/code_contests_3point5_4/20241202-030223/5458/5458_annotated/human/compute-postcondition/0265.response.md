Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
