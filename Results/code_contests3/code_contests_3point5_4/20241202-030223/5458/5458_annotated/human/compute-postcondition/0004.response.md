Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. n, m, and s are all 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. n, m, and s are all 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
