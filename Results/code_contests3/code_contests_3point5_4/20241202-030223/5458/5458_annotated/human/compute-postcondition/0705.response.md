Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. All variables retain their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Also, after entering the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`.
