Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `s` must be at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k, and the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
