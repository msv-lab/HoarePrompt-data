Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is assigned an integer value, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp` is updated accordingly, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is assigned an integer value, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
