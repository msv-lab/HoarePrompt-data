Postcondition: ***N, M, S, i, j+1, k, s have been updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the dp array have been finalized according to the loop logic for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, j should be less than or equal to m, k is now 1 for the loop to start. Additionally, i is not equal to 0. In addition, if j > k, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
