Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i` and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated accordingly**
