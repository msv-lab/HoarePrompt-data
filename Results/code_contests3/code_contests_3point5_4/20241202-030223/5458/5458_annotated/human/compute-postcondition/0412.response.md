Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input. `j` is incremented by 4, `k` is incremented by 2, and for the loop to execute `s` must be at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the mentioned variable assignments. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
