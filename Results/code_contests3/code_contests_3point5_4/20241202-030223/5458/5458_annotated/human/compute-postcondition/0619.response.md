Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will be as follows: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is either 0 or equal to the total number of iterations of the loop, `k` is `s`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`. The final values of `dp` will be based on the calculations within the loop for all iterations.**
