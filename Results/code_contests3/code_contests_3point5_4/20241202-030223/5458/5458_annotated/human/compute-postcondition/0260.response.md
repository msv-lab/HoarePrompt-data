Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, greater than or equal to `k`, and greater than or equal to `k` respectively. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
