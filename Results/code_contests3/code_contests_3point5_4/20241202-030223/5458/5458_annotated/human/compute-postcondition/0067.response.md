Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop will execute one more time if `j > k`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, and the assignment of `dp` values as described.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1, and the assignment of `dp` values as described**
