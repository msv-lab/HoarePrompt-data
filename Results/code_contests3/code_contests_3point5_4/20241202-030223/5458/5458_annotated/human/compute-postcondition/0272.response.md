Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is incremented by 1, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if part. There is no else part in the code.
