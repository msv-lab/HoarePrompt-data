Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Since the initial state of `dp[n]` remains unchanged, the other variables are also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with these unchanged conditions.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with these unchanged conditions**
