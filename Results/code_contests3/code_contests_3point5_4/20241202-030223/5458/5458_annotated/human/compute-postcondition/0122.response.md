Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `i`, `j+1`, and `s` have been updated based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. For the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. Additionally, if i = 0, then if (j >= k), dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, after the execution of the else part, j is greater than k and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
