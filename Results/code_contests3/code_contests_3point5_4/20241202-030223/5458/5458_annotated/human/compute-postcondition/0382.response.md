Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
