Output State: The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of the value at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, and `m` have been updated. `j` is set to 1, and `k` is updated accordingly. For the loop to run again, `s` must be greater than 0. The values in the `dp` array are adjusted. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
