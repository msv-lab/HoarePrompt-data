Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i == 0`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, no change occurs in the variables. If `i == 0` and `j` is less than `k`, no specific action is defined. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged.***
