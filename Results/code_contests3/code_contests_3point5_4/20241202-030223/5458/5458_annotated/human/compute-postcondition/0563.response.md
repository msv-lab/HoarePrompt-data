Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
