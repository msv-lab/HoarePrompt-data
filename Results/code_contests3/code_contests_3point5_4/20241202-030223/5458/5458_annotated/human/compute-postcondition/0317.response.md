According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of `dp[n]` remains unchanged does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. 
State: **The value of `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
