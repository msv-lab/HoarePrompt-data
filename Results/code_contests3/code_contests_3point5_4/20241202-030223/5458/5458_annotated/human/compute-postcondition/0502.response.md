Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is set to 1 based on the initial state. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
