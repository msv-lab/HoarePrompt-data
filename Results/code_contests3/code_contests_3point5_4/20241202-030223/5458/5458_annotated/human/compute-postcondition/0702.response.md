Example Answer:
The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the initial conditions state that all variables retain their values, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. Also, after entering the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`.**
