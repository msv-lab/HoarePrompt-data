Output State: **`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The loop continues without any change in variable values.**
