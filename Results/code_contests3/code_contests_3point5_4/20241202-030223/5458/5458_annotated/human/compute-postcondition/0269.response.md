Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is either incremented or remains the same, `k` is incremented by 1, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is either incremented or remains the same, `k` is incremented by 1, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop**
