Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated based on loop calculations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and after the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
