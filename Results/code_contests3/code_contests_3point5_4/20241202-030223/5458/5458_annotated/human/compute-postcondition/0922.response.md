Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 3`, `i + 2`, `k + 2` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j + 1` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j + 1` is not greater than `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
