Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is updated based on the loop parameters for the next iteration. Additionally, if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
