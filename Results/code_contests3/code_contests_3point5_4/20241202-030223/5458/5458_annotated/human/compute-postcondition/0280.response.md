Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` is 1. `j` and `k` are incremented by 1, so `j + 1` is `j + 1` and `k` remains 1. The condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k` is satisfied as `j` is incremented. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are all incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned 1**
