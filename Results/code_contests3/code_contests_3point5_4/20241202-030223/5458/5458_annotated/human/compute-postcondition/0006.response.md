Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions based on the values of `s` and `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges**
