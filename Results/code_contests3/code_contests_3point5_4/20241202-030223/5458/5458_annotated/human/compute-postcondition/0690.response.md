Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions**
