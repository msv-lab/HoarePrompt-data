Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1. The value of `i` is 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes the if part. If `i` is 0, then the function returns the updated state of the program based on the if part conditions. Otherwise, the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
