Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 2, and if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
