According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be adjusted so that it is increased by 1 for the loop to execute another time.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. The values of i, k, and s are determined based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the dp array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be increased by 1**.
