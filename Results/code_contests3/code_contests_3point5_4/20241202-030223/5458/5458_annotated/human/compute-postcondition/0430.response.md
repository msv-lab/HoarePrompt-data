Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of dividing `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` remain the same as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any change in values.
Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any change in values.**
