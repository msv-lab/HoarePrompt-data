Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed.**
