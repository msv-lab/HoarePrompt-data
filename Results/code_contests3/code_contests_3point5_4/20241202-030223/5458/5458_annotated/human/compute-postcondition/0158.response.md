Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated based on the loop calculations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is updated to 2, `i` is updated based on the loop calculations, `s` is updated based on the loop calculations. If `j >= k`, the variables are updated as described.***
