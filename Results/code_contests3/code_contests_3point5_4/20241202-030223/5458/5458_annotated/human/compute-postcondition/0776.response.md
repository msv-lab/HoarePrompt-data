According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all integers, `s` is greater than 0, and the conditions for updating `dp` are based on `j` and `k`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s**`.
