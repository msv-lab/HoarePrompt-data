Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Since `k` needs to be less than `s+1` for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is not incremented in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same, `k` must be less than `s+1 for the loop to execute one more time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same, `k` must be less than `s+1 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
