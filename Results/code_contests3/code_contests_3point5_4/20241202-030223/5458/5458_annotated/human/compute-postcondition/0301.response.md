Postcondition: ***`s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 1, all variables are incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at index `[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition that `j` is greater than `k`.***
