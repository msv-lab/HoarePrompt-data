According to the code, the `while 1` loop will continue indefinitely. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are only the values of `m` and `s` based on user input. No other states need to be adjusted as the loop will keep running indefinitely.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, only `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input**
