Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
