Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0. `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input. `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program retains the initial state without any changes. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.***
