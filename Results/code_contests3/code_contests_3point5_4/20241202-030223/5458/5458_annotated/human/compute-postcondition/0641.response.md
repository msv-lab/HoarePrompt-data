Postcondition: ***`dp` is correctly updated according to the conditions specified in the code snippet. All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` retain their initial conditions. If `i` equals 0, `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the calculation described in the code snippet is performed on the `dp` array.***
