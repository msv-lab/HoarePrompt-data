Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the initial state states that `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, these conditions hold true regardless of the outcome of the if statement where `j > k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
