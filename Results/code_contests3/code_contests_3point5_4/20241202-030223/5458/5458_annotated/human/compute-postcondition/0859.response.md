Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues without any change in values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers**
