Since the loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m+1`, we need to focus on the variable `j` for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has a certain value. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` needs to be updated to the next value after the previous iteration.

State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` will be updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the `dp` array will be finalized according to the loop logic. If the loop does not execute at all, the variables will remain in their initial state. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`.**
