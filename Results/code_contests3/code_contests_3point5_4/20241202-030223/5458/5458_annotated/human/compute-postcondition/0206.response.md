Postcondition: ***N, M, S, i, j, k, s are updated based on loop calculations. Values in the dp array are finalized. The loop has executed at least once with s greater than 0, j equals 1, and i is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, s > 0, j = 1. If j >= k, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. If i == 0, the state remains as described above. Otherwise, after the execution of the else part, the values in the dp array are updated based on modulo operation. The loop conditions are maintained with s > 0, j = 1, and i not equal to 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, loop conditions are maintained, and `i`, `j`, and `k` are modified.***
