Output State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is adjusted based on the conditions. The program state is updated according to the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
