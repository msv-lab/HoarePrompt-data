Postcondition: ***`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` retain their initial conditions. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k` for the program to continue without any changes. Otherwise, `k` must be within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute. If `i` is not equal to 0 and the if condition is satisfied, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.***
