According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. When the loop executes again, the value of `k` should be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k + 1]` which will have a final value of 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**.
