According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` needs to start from 1 and go up to `s`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`dp` is correctly updated, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is incremented by 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
