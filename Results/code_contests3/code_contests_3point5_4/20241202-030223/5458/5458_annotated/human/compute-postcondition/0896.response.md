According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `j` and `m`. In this case, `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, so as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` have been incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be incremented by 1**
