According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, so `k` should be 3 now.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without any change in values.**
