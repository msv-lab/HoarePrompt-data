Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue the loop or statement execution.**
