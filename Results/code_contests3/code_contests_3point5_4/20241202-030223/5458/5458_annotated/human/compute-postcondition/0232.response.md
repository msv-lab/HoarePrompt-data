Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `s` are the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s+1`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is determined based on the previous values in the `dp` array.***
