According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `n`. Initially, `j` starts at 1 and increases up to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted so that `j` is less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than or equal to `m`**
