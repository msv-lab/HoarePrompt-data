Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j > k` condition must be satisfied. If `i == 0`, the values of the variables remain the same. If `i != 0`, `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is at least 1, `j` is increased by 1. If `j > k`, the assignment of `dp` values as described is performed.***
