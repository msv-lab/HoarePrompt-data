Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed, given that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` if `j` is greater than `k`.***
