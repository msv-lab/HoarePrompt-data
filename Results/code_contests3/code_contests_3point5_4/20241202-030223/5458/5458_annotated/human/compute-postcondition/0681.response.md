Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the loop to execute the next time `s` is greater than 0, if j is greater than k.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions for the loop to execute the next time `s` is greater than 0, if j is greater than k.**
