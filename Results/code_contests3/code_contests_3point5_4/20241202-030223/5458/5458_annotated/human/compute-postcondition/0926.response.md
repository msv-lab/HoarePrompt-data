Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 3`, `i + 2`, `k + 2` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. If `i + 1` is 0, then `j + 1` must be greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i + 1` is not equal to 0, the updated values of `dp` are calculated based on the provided formula. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j > k`, then `dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 2][k]` is assigned the value 1 and all variables are incremented accordingly. If `j <= k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
