Output State: **The value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed, where `n`, `m`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers within specified ranges. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` are determined based on conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. The loop continues until `j` is greater than `S`.**
