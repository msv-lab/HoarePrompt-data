Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The condition for the loop to execute is when `s` is greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, and j is greater than or equal to k. Since all variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, the output state after this code execution is:
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], which is assigned the value 1.**
