Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated based on the loop calculations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is updated to 2, `i` is updated based on the loop calculations, `s` is updated based on the loop calculations. If `j >= k`, the variables are updated as described. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod***
