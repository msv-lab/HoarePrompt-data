Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected, but the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is used to calculate the new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is now stored in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is now stored in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
