Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than `s + 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`.***
