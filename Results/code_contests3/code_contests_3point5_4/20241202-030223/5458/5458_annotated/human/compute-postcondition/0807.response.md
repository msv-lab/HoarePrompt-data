Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of dividing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
