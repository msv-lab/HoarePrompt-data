Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The initial values of `i`, `j`, `k` are known to be 0, 1, 1 respectively. Since `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the new value of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0**
