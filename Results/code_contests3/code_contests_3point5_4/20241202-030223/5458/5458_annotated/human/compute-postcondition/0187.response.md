Output State: **N, M, S, i, j, k, s will be updated based on loop calculations. Values in dp array will be finalized. For the loop to execute first time, s > 0 and j = 1. Additionally, i != 0. Condition (j > k) is true. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod.**
