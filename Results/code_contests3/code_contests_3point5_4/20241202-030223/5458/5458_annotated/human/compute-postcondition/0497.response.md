Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. After all iterations, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which will have the same value as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after all iterations are completed.**
