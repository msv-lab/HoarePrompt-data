Output State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `s`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The values in the `dp` array are updated based on the new assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The loop does not change any variable values and the state of the program is retained for the next iteration.**
