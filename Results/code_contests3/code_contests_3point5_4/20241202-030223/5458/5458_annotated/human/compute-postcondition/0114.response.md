Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers within the specified ranges. i is updated based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the dp array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. For the loop to execute the first time m is greater than 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0. Additionally, i is equal to 0. If the condition (j >= k) is true, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
