Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 3`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the third time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 1. If `i == 0` and `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.***
