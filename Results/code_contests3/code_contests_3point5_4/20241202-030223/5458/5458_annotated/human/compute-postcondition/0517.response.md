Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]`, which will have a final value based on the conditions specified in the loop code after all iterations have finished. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` will be set to 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the loop.**
