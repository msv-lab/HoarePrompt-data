According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the loop is specified to run from 1 to s+1, k should be incremented by 1 to continue the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be `k + 1`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
