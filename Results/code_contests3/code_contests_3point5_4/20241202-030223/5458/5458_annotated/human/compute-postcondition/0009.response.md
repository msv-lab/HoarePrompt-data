According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since i is 0 and j is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, k should be 1.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, i is 0, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0**
