Postcondition: ***All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k + 1]` which will have a final value of 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program fragment does not alter any variables except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k + 1]` which will be set to 1.***
