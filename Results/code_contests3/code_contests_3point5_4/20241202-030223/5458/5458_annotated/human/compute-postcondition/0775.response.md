Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all integers. If `i` is 0, all variables are incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, after execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
