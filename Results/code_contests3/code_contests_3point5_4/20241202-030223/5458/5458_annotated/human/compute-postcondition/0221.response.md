Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` remain the same. The loop continues to execute if `j > k`.
Output State: **All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` remain the same. The loop continues to execute if `j > k`.**
