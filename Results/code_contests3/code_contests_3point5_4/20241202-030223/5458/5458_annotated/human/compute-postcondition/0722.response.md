Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 3`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the third time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0. After the if-else block, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
