According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. 
Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1.
