Example Answer:
The values of N, M, and S are assigned by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. Since N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges, the values are valid. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges**
