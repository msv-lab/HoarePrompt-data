Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their initial conditions, `n`, `m`, and `s` are unchanged. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, `i` retain their initial conditions, `k` is incremented by 1**
