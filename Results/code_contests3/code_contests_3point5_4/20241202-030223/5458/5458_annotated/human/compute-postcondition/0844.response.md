According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Since the loop is iterating through the range from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be less than `s`.**
