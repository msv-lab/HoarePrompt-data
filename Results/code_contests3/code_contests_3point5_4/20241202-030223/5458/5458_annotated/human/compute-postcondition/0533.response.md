Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further code.***
