Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges. i is 1, j is 1, k is updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be updated to the next value in the range from 1 to s+1**
