According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state should be adjusted such that `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute. 
State: **`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the code snippet, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` retain their initial conditions, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute**
