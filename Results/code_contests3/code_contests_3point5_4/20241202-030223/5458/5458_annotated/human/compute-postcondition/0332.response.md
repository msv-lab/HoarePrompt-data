According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s + 1`. So at the start of the next iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than `s + 1**
