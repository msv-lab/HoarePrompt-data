Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s` are updated based on loop calculations. Values in the `dp` array are finalized. The loop has executed at least once with `s` greater than 0, `j` equals 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `s > 0`, `j = 1`, and if `(j > k)` is true, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo mod.***
