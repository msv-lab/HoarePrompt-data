Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables are incremented by 1 in the initial state, the new values of the variables are used in the assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by 1; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by 1; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s**
