Example Answer:
The element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `j` remains greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`**
