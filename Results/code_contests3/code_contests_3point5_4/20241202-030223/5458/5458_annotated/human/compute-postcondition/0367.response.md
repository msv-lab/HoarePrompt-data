Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, `dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` are assigned integer values based on user input, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 2. If `j >= k`, then based on the value of `i`, either `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 or it takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
