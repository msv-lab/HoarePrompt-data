Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is incremented by 1. `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
