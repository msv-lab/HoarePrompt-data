Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same as they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
