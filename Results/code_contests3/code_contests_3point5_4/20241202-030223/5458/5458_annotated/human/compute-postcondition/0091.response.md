Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is 0, the value of `i + 1 & 1` is 1. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, as per the initial state. Therefore, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`**
