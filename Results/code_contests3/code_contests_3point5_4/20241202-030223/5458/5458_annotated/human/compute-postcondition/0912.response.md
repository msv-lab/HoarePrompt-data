Postcondition: ***All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 2`, `i + 1`, `k + 1` are incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1. Additionally, if `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the updated values of `dp` are based on the calculations. After the execution of the if else block, the program variables maintain their incremented values and the conditions specified in the precondition.***
