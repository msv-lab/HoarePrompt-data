Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i == 0`, then after the execution, if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.***
