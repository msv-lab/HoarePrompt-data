Output State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s**.
