Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` are updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the `dp` array will be finalized according to the loop logic for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is now 1 for the loop to start. `i` is equal to 0. Also, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
