Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`, and then added to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k].` No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: After the assignment, the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and the other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **After the assignment, the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and the other variables remain unchanged.**
