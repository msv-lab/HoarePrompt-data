Postcondition: ***`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `i + 1`, `k` are all incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain incremented by the total number of times the loop executed, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.***
