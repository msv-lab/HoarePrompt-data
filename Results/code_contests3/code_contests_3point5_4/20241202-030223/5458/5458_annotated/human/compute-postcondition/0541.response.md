Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is an unknown constant. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented or updated based on their previous values. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, other variables remain unchanged**
