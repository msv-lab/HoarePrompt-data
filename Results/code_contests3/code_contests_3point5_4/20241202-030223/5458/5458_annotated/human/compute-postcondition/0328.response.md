Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned an integer value based on user input, `s` is assigned an integer value based on user input, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration or block of code.***
