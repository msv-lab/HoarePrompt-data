Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment. The loop condition states that `j` should be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` is updated based on loop calculations, `k` is 2, `s` is updated based on loop calculations, `j` is less than or equal to `m, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` is updated based on loop calculations, `k` is 2, `s` is updated based on loop calculations, `j` is less than or equal to `m, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
