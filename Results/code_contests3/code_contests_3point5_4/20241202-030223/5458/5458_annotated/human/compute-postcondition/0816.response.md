Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` if `j` is greater than `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **All variables `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+1`, `k`, `i` are integers. The updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions mentioned.**
