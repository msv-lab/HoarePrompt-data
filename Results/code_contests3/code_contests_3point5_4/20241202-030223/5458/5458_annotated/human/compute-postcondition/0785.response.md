According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all incremented by 1, and `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1. In this case, `k` is incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s**.
