Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. All variables remain unchanged except for this assignment. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is known to be its previous value modulo `mod`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since other variables are not affected, the Output State is: All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.
Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is assigned the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`**
