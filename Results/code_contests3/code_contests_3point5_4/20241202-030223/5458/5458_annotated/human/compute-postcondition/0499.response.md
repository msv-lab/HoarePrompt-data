According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][m + 1][k]` which will have a final value of 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1**
