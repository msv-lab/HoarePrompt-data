Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state will be that `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. The values of `i`, `k`, and `s` are determined based on the conditional statements within the loop. The values in the `dp` array are updated according to the calculations within the loop for all iterations. The loop will continue until `j` is greater than `S`. The conditions within the loop dictate the specific values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
