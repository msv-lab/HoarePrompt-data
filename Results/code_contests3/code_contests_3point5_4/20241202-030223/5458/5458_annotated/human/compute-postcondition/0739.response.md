Postcondition: ***`dp` is correctly updated based on the conditions specified in the code snippet. `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` retain their initial conditions. `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive for the loop to execute. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program will execute the if part.***
