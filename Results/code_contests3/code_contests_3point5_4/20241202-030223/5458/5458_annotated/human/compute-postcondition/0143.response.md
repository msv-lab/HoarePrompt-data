According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `m`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 
Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `s` updated based on the loop calculations. The values in the `dp` array will be finalized according to the loop logic for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is now 1 for the loop to start**
