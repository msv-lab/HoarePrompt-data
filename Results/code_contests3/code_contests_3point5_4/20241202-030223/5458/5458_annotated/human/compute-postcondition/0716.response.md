Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 2`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. For the loop to execute the second time, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is equal to 0, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, no changes are made to the variables.***
