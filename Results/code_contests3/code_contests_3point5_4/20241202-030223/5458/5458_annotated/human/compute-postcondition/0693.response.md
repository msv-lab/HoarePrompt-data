Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j + 1`, `k + 1`, and `i` retain their initial conditions. The final values of `dp` are calculated based on the conditions inside the loop code. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
