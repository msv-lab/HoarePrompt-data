Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges. `k` is in the range 1 to `S + 1`, `i` is either 0 or increased by 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the element at index `[1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` or `dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, if `i` is 0, no changes occur in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
