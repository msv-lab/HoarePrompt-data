The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads the input, calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions, and outputs the remainder when divided by 100000. The nested loops and conditions within the program correctly handle the constraints specified in the problem description. It ensures that the integers in each square are within the given limits, the sum of integers on the card is correct, and the integers are arranged in ascending order within each column. The program terminates correctly when the input is 0 for all variables.
