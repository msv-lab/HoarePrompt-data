Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will update `dp` accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will update `dp` accordingly.**
