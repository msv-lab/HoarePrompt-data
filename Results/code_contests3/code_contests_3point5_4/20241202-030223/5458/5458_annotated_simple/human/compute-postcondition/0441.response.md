Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. After the execution of the if-else block, the state remains the same, ensuring the conditions mentioned above.***
