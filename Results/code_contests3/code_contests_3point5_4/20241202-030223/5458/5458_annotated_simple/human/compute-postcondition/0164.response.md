Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers. If i == 0, N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 2. The loop will execute one more time if j >= k. If i != 0, N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 1. If j > k, all variables are further incremented by 1. If j <= M, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
