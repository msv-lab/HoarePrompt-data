Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented to `s`, `j` is less than `m`, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
