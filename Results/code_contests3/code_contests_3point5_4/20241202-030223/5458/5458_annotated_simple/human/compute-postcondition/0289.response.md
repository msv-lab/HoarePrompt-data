Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k, m, s` are integers with specific conditions. If `j` >= `k`, then `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. Otherwise, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***
