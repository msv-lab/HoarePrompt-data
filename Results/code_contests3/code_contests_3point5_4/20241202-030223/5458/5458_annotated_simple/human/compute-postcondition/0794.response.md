Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. The loop will execute `s` times, and the final values of the variables will depend on the loop conditions and the initial values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, and `dp`.**
