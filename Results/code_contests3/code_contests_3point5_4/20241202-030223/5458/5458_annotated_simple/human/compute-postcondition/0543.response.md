According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, and `j`. Since the loop is iterating over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. 

For the loop to execute the next time:
- `j` should be incremented by 1
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1.**
