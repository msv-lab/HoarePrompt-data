According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. The values of `i` and `j` are updated during the loop iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration**
