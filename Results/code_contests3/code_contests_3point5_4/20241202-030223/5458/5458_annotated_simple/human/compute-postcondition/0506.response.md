Example Answer:
The calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been executed, where the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is computed. Now, the code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed, which adds the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been executed and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been executed and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed**
