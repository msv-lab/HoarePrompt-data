Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=4`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The loop will execute again only if `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `s` is greater than 0, the loop executes. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, otherwise it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j > k`.***
