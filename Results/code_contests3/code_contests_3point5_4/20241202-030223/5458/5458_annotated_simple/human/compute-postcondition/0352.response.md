According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` is the initial value, `j+1` is the initial value, and the initial state of `dp` based on the logic and calculations within the loop.
State: **for the loop to execute, `n`, `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is the initial value, `j+1` is the initial value, `dp` is initialized based on the logic within the loop**
