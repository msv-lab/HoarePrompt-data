According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m + 1`. Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `m + 1`. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
