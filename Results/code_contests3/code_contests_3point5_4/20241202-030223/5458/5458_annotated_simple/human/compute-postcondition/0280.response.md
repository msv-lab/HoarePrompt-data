Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of the variables `N, M, S, mod, i, j, k, m, s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
