According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. To ensure the loop executes, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` and `j+1` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
