According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
