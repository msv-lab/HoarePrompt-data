Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration**
