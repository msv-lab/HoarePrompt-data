Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j`. Since the calculation does not involve these variables directly, their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range of 1 to s + 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range of 1 to s + 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
