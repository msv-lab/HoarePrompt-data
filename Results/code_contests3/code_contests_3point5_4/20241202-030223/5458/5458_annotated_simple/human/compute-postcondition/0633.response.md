Postcondition: ***The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
