Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `k` must satisfy the condition `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged.***
