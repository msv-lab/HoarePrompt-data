Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific output state can be determined due to unknown initial values.
Output State: **No specific output state can be determined due to unknown initial values**
