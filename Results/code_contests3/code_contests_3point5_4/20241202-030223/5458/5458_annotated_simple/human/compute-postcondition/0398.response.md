According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` needs to be increased by 1, so `k` will be `k + 1`.
- All other variables remain the same as they are not affected by the loop variable `k`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. If `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j >= k`. Otherwise, if `j > k`, no variables are changed and the program continues.**
