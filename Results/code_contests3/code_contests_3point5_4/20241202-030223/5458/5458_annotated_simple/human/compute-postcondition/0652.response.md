Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all integers greater than 0. The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1.**
