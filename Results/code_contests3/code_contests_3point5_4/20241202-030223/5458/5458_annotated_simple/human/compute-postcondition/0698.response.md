Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 based on the current value of `i`, `j + 1` increases the value of `j` by 1, and `k` remains unchanged. Since the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` array is updated with the assigned value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
