Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are unchanged. The loop will continue to the next iteration if `j` is greater than `k`. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration**
