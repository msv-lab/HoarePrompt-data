According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers and if `j` >= `k`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k + 1` should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` >= `k + 1`, the program state is ready for another iteration of the loop**
