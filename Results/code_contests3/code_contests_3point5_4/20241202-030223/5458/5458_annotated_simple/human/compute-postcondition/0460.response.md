Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment takes place. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s, k, i+1 are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time m is greater than or equal to 1, j is 2, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is calculated based on the conditions mentioned.
