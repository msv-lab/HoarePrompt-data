Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
