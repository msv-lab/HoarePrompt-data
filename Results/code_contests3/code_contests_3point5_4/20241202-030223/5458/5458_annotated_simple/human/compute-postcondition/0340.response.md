Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` >= `k`, the state of the program after the execution of the if else block is as follows: If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` is updated and assigned a new value. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
