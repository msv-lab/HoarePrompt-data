According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`, `j`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and the loop variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, and `k` is increased by 1.**
