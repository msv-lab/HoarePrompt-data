The code snippet assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since all variables are initially incremented by 1, the new values after the execution will be k = k + 1, s = s + 1, i = i + 1, and j = j + 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time based on the conditions specified. The other variables N, M, S, mod remain unaffected.

Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1**
