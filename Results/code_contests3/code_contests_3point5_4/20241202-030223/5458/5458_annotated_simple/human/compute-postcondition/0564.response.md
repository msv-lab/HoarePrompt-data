Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` and `j+1` are updated accordingly. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. After the if condition `(j > k)` is true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
