Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If `i != 0`, no specific output state can be determined due to unknown initial values.***
