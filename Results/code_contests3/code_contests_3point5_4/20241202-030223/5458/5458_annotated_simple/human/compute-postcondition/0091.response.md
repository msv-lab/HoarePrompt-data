Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `k+1` is less than or equal to `S`. The initial state variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S**
