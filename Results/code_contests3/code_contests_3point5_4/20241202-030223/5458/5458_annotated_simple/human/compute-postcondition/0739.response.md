Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will execute one more loop iteration with `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remaining the same and `i` incremented by 1, `j` incremented by `m + 1`.***
