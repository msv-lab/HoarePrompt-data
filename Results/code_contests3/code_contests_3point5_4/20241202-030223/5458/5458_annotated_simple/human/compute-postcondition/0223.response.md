Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, S must be greater than or equal to 1 and k must be 1. If i == 0, then j is greater than or equal to k. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, then if j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
