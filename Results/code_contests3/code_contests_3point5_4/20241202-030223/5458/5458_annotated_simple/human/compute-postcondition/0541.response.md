Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are not affected by this operation. Since `j+1` is incremented by 1, we need to check if `j+1 > k` to determine if the loop will execute the next time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, where `j+1` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, where `j+1` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
