According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, `k` retain their initial values. If `i == 0`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is 2. If i == 0, dp[1][3][1] is equal to 1. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.**
