Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000. If i == 0, dp[1][3][1] is equal to 1 and j is updated to 3. If i == 0, and j >= k, dp[1][4][k] is assigned the value 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If i == 0 and j < k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by taking the modulo mod value. If i != 0, all variables remain the same, and the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] by taking the modulo mod value.***
