According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and `s` is an integer greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1`. This means that the value of `k` needs to be adjusted to `s + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **Output State: `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all integers greater than 0. The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`, while other variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
