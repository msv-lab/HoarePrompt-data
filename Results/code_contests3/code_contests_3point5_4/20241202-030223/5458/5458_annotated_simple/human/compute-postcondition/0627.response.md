According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since the final value of `dp[n]` is not affected by the loop, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected by the code, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
