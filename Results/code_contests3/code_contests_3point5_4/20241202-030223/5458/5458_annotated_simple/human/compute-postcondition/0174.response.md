Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are integers. The final values of these variables depend on the conditions within the loop and the number of iterations. If the loop executes fully, the variables will be incremented and updated based on the calculations within the loop. If the loop does not execute at all, the variables will remain as they were after the initial state.**
