Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. If `j >= k`, then based on the conditions mentioned, either `j` is set to be greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned specific values, or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to a certain value. If `j > k`, no variables are changed.***
