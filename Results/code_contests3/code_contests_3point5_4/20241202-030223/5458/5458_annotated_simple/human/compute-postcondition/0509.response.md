Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i is 1, j is 1, and k is 3, the value is assigned to dp[2][2][3]. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m are greater than 1, s is 1, k is 3, i is 1, j is 1, dp[2][2][3] is 1.
Output State: **n, m are greater than 1, s is 1, k is 3, i is 1, j is 1, dp[2][2][3] is 1**
