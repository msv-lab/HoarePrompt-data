Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range of 1 to s + 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the function executes the if block. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
