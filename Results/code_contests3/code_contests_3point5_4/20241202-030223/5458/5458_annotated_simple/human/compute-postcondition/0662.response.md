According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute**
