According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. 

After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. In the else part, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers**.
