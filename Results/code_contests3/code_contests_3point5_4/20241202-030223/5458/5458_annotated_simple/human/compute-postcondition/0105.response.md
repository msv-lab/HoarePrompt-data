Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k+1 ≤ S. The updated values of dp where dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j >= k when i is equal to 0. Otherwise, the updated values of dp are maintained for the else part.***
