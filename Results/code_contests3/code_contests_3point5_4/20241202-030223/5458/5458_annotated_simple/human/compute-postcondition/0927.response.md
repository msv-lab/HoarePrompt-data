Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` being 0 and `j` being less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. If `j >= k`, the variable `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. After the if-else block, if `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement with the same initial conditions. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
