Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute. If `i` is equal to 0, then `i` is set to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of the division of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
