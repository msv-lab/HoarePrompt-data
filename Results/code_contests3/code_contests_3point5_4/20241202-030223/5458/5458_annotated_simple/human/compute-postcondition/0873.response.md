Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the updated values. Otherwise, the program proceeds unchanged.***
