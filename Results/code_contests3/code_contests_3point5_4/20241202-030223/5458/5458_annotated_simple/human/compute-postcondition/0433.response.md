According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. 

Since the loop is iterating over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`, and `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. So, after adjusting the states for the next iteration:
State: *`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1*
