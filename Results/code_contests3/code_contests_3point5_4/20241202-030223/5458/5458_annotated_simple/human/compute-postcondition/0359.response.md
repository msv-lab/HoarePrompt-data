Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The logic within the loop initializes `dp` based on certain rules, but those rules are not specified here. Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the output state would be based on the updated value of `dp` after this assignment.
Output State: **Updated values of dp based on the assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
