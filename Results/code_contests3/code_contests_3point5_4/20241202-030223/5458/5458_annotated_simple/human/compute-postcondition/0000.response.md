Example Answer:
The variable `mod` is assigned the value 100000. Since the values of N, M, and S are not affected by this assignment, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
