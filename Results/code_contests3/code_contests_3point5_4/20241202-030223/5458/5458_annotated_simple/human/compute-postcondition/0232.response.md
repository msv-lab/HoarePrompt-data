Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` must be less than `S + 1`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes occur in the values.***
