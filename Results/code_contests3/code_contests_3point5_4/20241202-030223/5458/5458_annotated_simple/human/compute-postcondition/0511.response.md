Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the assignment**
