Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all integers with `n` and `m` equal to 1. `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, `dp` values are updated according to the formula provided. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1 and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.**
