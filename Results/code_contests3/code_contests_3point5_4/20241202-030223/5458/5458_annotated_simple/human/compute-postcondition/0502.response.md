Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of all variables remain the same since no calculations are performed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
