Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided, but based on the assignment, the values are copied from the previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time**
