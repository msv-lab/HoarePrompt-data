Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly provided, but we know that `j` >= `k + 1` for another iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` >= `k + 1`, the program state is ready for another iteration of the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 2`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` >= `k + 1`, the program state is ready for another iteration of the loop, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.**
