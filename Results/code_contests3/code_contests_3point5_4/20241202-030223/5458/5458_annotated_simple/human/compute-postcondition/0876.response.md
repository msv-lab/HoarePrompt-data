Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
