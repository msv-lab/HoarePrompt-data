Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000. The values of dp after the loop execution will depend on the conditions inside the loop, and all other variables will retain their initial values. If the loop does not execute, all variables will remain unchanged.**
