According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `n`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n**2`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are integers. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1.
- If `i != 0` and `j > k`, then the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be equal to the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.
- For the loop to execute another time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n**2`**
