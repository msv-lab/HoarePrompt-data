Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i, j, k, N, M, S, mod` are incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 3 to ensure the loop executes again. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, i, j, k` are all integers incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 3 to ensure the loop executes again.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i, j, k` are all integers incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 3 to ensure the loop executes again.**
