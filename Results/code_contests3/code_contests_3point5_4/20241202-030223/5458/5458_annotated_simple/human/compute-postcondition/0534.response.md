According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` >= `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1, and if `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue to the next iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`**
