Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `S` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0, then `j >= k` for the loop to execute. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop code.**
