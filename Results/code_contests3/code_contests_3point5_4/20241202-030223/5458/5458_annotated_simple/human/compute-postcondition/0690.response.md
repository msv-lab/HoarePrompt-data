Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: *`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j > k`, the loop continues to the next iteration with updated values of `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j > k`, the loop continues to the next iteration with updated values of `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2`**
