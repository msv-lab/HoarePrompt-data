Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated as mentioned in the initial state. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will execute one more loop iteration with `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remaining the same and `i` incremented by 1, `j` incremented by `m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program will execute one more loop iteration with `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remaining the same and `i` incremented by 1, `j` incremented by `m + 1`**
