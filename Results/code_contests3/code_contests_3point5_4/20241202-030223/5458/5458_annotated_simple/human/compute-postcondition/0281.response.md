Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k, m, s` are integers with specific conditions. If `j` >= `k`, then `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.***
