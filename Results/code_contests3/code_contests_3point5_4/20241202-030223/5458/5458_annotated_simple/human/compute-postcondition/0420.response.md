According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i+1` being integers greater than or equal to 1 doesn't guarantee the loop will execute, so the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is now 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
