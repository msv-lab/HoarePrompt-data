Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `k`, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
