Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
