According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes again with updated values of `i` and `j+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i+1` and `j+1` are integers, `k=2`, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` and `j+1` need to be updated accordingly based on the conditions mentioned in the code.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 2**
