According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to m+1 based on the variable j. For the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: n, m, s, k, i+1, j+1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- n, m, s remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop.
- k remains 1 as specified.
- i+1 is updated based on the conditions within the loop.
- j+1 should be incremented by 1 to indicate the next iteration of the loop.

State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` and `j+1` should be updated accordingly.**
