According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` should be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k + 1` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` has been updated**
