Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on those initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, and j is greater than k**
