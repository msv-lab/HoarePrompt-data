According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, all variables remain integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, and `i` remains not equal to 0**.
