According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be between 1 and 7. In the given code snippet, the loop variable is `i`, so it needs to be adjusted to represent the first iteration of the loop. Since the loop starts from 0, the adjusted state should be `N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time`. 
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000, i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
