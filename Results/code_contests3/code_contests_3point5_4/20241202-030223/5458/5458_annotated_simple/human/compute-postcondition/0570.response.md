Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 2**
