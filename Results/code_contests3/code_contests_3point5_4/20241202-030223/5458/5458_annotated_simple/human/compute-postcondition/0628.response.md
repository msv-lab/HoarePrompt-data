According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the final value of `dp[n]` is not affected by the code, so it remains the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1.
State: **The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1**
