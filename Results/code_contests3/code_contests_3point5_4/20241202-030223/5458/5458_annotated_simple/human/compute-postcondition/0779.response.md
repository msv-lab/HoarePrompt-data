Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` remain within the specified range. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration**
