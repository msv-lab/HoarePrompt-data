Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S. If j > k, then N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
