Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m, s` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the provided code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
