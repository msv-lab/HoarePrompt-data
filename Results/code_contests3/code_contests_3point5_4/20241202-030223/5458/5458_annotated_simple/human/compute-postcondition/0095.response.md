Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The values of the variables are updated based on the calculations, considering the constraints mentioned in the initial state. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k should be less than or equal to S, updated values of dp**
