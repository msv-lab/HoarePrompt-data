Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range of 1 to s + 1. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
