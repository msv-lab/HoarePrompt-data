According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers and S is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the updated values will be as follows:

State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j is incremented by 1, k remains the same, for the loop to execute again j must be less than or equal to m**
