Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same. The condition `s` being greater than 0 and `i` not equal to 0 is maintained, and `j` is still greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i+1, j is 1, k is 1, s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i+1, j is 1, k is 1, s is greater than 0, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than k**
