Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. If j > k, all variables are further incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, j must be less than or equal to M. If the condition is not met, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
