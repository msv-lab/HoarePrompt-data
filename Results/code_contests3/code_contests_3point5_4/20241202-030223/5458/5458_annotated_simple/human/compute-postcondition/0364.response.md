Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `dp` is initialized based on the logic within the loop. If `i` is equal to 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated following the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` in the else part. Furthermore, if `j` is greater than `k`, the values of `dp` are modified accordingly. Upon the completion of the if else block, the state of the program variables will be updated as described above.***
