According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions mentioned for updating `dp` values. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s` and `i` should be 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than `s`**
