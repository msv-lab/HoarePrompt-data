Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. If `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, `dp` values are updated. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain as 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, `dp` values are updated. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.***
