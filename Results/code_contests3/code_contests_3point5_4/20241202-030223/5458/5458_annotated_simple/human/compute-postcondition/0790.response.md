Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and all incremented by 1. If `j > k`, the program updates the variables and `dp` values according to the loop conditions.***
