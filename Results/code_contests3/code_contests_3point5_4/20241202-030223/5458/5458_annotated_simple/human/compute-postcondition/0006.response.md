Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions based on the values of `N`, `M`, and `S`. The inner lists are initialized with zeros. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
