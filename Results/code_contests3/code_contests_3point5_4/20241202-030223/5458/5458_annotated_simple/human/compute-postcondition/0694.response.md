According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
