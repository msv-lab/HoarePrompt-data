Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, the program will update `dp` accordingly.***
