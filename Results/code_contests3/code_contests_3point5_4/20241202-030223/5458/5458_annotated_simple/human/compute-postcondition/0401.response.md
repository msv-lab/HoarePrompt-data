Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated**
