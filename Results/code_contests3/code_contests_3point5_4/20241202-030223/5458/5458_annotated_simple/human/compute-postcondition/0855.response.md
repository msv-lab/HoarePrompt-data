Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if block, `k` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater or equal to `k`.***
