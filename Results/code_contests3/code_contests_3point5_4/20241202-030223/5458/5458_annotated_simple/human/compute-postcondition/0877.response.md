According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is at least 2**, `k` is 1.
