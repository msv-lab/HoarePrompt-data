According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers greater than or equal to 1. The `dp` array has been updated based on the loop logic and calculations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1. `dp` array is updated based on the conditions and calculations within the loop**.
