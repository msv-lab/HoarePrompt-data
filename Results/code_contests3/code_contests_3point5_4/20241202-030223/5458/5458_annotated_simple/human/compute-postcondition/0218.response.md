Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, S must be greater than or equal to 1 and k must be 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k.
