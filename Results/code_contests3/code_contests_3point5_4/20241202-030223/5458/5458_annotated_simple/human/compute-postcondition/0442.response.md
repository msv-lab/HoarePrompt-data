According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is increased by 1**
