Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` remains not equal to 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` remains not equal to 0**
