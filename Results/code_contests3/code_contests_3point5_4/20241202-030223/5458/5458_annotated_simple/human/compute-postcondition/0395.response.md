Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 if `j >= k`, `j` should be less than or equal to `m+1`. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, no variables are changed and the program continues to the next iteration or statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
