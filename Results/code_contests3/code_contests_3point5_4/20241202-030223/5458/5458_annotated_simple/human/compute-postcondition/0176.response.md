According to the code, the loop will execute s times. Before the loop starts, the loop can execute if s is at least 1. The variables N, M, S, mod, i, j are incremented by 1, but it does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute the first time, k should be 1.
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j are incremented by 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than 0**
