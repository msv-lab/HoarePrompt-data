According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated. The condition `j` is less than `m` holds true. Upon entering the if condition where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else part, `k` is incremented to `s`, `j` is less than `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, and after the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is currently in the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all variables are incremented by 1, for the next iteration, the value of `k` should be incremented by 1 within the range of 1 to `s`.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated. The condition `j` is less than `m` holds true. Upon entering the if condition where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. In the else part, `k` is incremented to `s`, `j` is less than `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, and after the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be within the range of 2 to `s` (inclusive)**.
