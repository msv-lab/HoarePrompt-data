Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 3, k is the next value after the last iteration of the loop. If j >= k, dp[1][4][k] is assigned the value 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, there are no changes to the variables.***
