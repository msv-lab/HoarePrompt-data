Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
