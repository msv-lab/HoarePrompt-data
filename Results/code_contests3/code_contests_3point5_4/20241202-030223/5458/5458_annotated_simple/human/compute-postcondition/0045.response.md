Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1, the updated element will be `dp[1][3][1] = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is 1, dp[1][3][1] is 1**
