Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since i is 0, j is s, and k is incremented by 1, the new values for i, j, and k are 0, s+1, and k+1 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m is greater than 0, s is at least 1, k is incremented by 1, i is 0, j is now s+1, dp values are updated, j is greater than or equal to k.
Output State: **n, m is greater than 0, s is at least 1, k is incremented by 1, i is 0, j is now s+1, dp values are updated, j is greater than or equal to k**
