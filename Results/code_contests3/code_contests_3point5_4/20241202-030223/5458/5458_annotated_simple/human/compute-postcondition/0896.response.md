According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `s + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
