Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` being 0, and `j` being less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement with the same initial conditions.***
