Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function returns the current state. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
