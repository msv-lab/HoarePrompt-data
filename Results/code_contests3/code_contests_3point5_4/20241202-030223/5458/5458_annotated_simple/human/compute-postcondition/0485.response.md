According to the loop code, the loop will execute based on the values of `m` and `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, `m` and `j` are both equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `j` must be updated to 2.

State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2**
