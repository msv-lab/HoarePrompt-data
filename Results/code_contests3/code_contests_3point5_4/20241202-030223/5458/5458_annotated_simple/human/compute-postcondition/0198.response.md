According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i, j, k` are all integers incremented by 1. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of (dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod) + (dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i, j, k` are all integers incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `k` needs to be incremented by 1**
