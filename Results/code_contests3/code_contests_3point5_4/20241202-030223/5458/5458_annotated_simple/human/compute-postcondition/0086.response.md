Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `i, j, k` are affected by this operation. `dp` is an array that is updated based on the values of `i, j, k`. The output state will depend on the initial values of `i, j, k` and the previous values of `dp`. 
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k is incremented by 1 if j > k, and dp is updated based on the given operation**
