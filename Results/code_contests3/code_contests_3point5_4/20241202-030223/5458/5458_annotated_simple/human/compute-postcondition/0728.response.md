According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `j` is equal to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that it is less than `n ** 2`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `dp` will depend on the conditions within the loop. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
