Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. If `i == 0`, then `j >= k`, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on loop conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0`, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated and calculated based on specified conditions.***
