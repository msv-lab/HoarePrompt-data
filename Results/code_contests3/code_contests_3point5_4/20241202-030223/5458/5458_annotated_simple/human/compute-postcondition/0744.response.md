Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is adjusted based on the loop condition, `j` is adjusted based on the loop condition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is adjusted based on the loop condition, `j` is adjusted based on the loop condition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
