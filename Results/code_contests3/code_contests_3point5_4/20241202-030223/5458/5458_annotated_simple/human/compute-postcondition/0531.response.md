Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the initial state is not fully defined, we can only deduce that this operation involves modulo operation and updating the value of `dp` based on the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0 and if `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
