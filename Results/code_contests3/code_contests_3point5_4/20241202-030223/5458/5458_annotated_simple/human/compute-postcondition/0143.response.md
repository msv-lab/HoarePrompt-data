According to the code, the loop executes for values of k in the range from 1 to s. The loop executes as long as j is less than or equal to m. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j incremented by 1, k remains the same, for the loop to execute again j must be less than or equal to m**
