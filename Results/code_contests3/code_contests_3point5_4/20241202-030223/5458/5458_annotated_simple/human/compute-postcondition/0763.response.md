According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). Before the loop starts, the values that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1
- `dp` values need to be updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive)**
