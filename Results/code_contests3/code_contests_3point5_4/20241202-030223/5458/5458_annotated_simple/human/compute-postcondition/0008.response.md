According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j ranges from 1 to m inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the value of m must be at least 1. Since i is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, it needs to be adjusted to j is 1. 
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1**
