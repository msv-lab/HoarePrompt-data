Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` and `j+1` are updated accordingly. When the program enters the if condition `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes one more time with updated values of `i` and `j+1`. If `i` is not equal to 0, after the if condition `(j > k)` is true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.***
