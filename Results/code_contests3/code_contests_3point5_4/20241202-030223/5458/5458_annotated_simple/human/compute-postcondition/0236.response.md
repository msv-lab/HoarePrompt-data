Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, but based on the constraints given, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k + 1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k + 1` must be less than `S + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k + 1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` must be less than `S + 1`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k + 1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` must be less than `S + 1`**
