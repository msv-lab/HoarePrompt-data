Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 2` are integers greater than 0, `k + 2` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1**
