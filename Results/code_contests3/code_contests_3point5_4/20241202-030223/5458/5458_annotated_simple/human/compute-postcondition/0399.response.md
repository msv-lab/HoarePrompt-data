Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. If `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j >= k`. Otherwise, if `j > k`, no variables are changed and the program continues.**
