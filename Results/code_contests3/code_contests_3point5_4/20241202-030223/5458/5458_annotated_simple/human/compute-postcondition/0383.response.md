Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1. The `dp` array is updated based on the logic within the loop. If `i == 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, the values of `dp` are modified according to the conditions specified in the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of `dp` are updated accordingly.**
