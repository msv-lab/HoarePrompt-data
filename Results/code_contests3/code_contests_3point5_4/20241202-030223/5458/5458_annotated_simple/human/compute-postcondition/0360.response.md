Example Answer:
The code snippet provided is a `continue` statement, which will skip the remaining code in the loop and continue to the next iteration. Since no variables are being modified or affected by this code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **Updated values of dp based on the assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
