According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, and `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. If `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp` values are updated.**
