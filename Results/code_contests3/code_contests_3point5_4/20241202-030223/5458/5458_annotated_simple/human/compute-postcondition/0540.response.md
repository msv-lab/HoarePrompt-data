Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the next time, `j` is incremented by 1. If `j > k`, then the loop will not execute.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the next time, `j+1` is incremented by 1. If `j+1 > k`, then the loop will not execute.**
