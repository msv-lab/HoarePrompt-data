Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the calculation takes place. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` depends on the previous states of `i`, `j`, and `k`, which are 1, 2, and 2 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been executed**
