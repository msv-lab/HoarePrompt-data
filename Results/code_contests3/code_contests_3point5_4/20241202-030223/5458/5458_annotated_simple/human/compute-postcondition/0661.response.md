According to the code, the loop executes as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `k`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment `j` by 1 as the loop variable.
- If `j` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, then assign `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` the value 1.
- If `j` is less than `k`, update the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.
- The loop should continue to execute until `k` reaches `s + 1`.

State: **Output State: `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than or equal to `s`.**
