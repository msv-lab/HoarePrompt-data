According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

For the next iteration of the loop:
1. Increment `k` by 1.
2. Update the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the condition provided in the code.

State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time.**
