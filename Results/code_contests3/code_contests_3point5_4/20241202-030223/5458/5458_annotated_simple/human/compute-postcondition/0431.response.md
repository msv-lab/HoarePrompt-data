Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. Since all variables are initially 1, after execution, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 2.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 2**
