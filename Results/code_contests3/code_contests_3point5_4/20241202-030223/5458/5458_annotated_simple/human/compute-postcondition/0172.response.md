Example Answer:
After the execution of the if statement where j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. Then, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is modified accordingly.
Output State: **After the execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is modified accordingly**
