Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are all incremented by 1. If `j` becomes greater than `k`, no changes occur in the current state. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain within the range of 1 to `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, and `dp` values are updated accordingly.
Output State: **All variables remain within the range of 1 to `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration.**
