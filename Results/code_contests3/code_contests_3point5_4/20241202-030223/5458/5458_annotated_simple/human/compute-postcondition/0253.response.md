Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
