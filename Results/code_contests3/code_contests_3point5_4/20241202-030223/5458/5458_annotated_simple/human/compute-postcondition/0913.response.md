Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed, and the values of `n`, `m`, `s` remain unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers, if `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `dp` values are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers, if `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `dp` values are updated accordingly**
