According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, and updated `dp` values are provided. If `i == 0`, the `dp` array is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j >= k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute one more time for the values to be updated. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, updated `dp` values based on the logic within the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, `dp` array is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j >= k`.**
