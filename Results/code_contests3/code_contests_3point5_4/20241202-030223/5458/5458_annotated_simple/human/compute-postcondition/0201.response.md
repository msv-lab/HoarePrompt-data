Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are all incremented by 1, so the new values are: i, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, k needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again k needs to be incremented by 2.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again k needs to be incremented by 2**
