Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` are 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` has been added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`.**
