Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are integers. If i = 0, then all variables are incremented by 1 and the loop will execute again as j <= m, i = 0, j >= k. If i is not equal to 0, N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, j must be less than or equal to m. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
