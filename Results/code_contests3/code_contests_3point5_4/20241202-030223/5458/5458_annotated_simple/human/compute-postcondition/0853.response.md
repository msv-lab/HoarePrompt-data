According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration**.
