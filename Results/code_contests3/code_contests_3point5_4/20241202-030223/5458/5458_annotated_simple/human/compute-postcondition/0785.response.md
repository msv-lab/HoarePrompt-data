According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` and all incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and also incremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and all incremented by 1**
