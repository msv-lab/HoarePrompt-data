According to the code, the loop can execute again if k is less than or equal to s. At the end of the last iteration, k is equal to s. So for the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be less than s. 
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, for the loop to execute one more time j is 1, k is less than S**
