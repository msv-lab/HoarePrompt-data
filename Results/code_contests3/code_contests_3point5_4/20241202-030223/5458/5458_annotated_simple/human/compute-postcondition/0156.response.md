According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables N, M, S, mod, i, j, k. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables are incremented by 1 if i = 0 and by 1 if i is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, j must be less than or equal to m. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than or equal to m**
