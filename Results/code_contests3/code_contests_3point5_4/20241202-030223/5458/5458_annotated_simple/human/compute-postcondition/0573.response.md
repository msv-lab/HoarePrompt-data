Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the given integer values. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.**
