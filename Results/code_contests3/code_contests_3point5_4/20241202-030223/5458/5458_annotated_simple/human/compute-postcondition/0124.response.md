Example Answer:
The code updates the dp array according to the conditions mentioned. Since the code only assigns the value of 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k], the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers and the dp array is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] set to 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers and the dp array is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] set to 1**
