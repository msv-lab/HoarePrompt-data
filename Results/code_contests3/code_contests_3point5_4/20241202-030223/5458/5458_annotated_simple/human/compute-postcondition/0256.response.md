Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, otherwise no changes occur in the variables.***
