According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` needs to be reset to 1.
State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s**`.
