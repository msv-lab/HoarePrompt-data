Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined positive integers N, M, and S where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function reads input from the user until N, M, and S are all 0. It then performs a series of calculations using dynamic programming techniques and finally prints a result based on the values of N, M, and S.**
