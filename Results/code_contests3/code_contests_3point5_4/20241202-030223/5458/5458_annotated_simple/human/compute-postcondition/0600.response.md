According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0. So, in the next iteration, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=3`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers, for the loop to execute again `s` must be greater than 0**
