Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers. For the loop to execute again, S must be greater than 0. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp array is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] set to 1. If i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is updated to dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod. The code snippet assigns the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
