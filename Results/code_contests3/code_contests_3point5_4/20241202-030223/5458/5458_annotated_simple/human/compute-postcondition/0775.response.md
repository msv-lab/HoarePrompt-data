Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` remain unchanged. For both if and else parts, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive). If `i` is equal to 0, the program proceeds as specified for the if part. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
