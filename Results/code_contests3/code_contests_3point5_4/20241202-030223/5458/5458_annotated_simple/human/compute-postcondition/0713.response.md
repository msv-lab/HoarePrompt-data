Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0. `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, and `i` remains not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values without any changes.***
