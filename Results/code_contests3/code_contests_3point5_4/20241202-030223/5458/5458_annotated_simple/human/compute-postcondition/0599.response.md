Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. For the loop to execute `s` must be greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then after entering the if condition `j` will be greater than `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly based on the conditions provided.***
