According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m + 1`. Hence, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j is M + 1, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000**
