According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `j` is within the range of 1 to m+1. Therefore, the loop will execute if m is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the condition for `i` to be less than `n` is given. So, in order for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i + 1`, `j`, `k` remain the same, and `m` is at least 1.
State: **N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k, m is at least 1, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n**
