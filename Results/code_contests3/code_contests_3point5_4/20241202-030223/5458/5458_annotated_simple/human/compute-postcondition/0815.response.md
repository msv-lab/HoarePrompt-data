Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated. The condition `j` is less than `m` holds true. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` is incremented to `s`, `j` is less than `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, and after the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be within the range of 2 to `s` (inclusive)**
