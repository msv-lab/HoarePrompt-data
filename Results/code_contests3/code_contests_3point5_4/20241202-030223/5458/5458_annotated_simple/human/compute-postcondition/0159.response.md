Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are all incremented by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, j must be less than or equal to m.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than or equal to m**
