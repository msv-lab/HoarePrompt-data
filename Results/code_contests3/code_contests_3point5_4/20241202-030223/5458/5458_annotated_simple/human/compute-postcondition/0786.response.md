Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` and all incremented by 1. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.**
