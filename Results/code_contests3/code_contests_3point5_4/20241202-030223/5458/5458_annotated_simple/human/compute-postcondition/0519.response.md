According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. So, the next iteration will have `i` increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `i+1` must be less than `n ** 2`**
