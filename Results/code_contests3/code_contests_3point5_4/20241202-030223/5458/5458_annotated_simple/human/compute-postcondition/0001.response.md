According to the code, the `while 1` loop will execute indefinitely as the condition is always true. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one time. No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
