Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the program maintains the same state as described in the precondition.***
