Output State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. If `i == 0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the result of the calculations based on the conditions provided in the loop.**
