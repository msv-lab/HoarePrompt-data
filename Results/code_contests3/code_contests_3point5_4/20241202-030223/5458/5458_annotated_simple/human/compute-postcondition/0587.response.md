According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. If `i == 0`, the values remain the same. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i & 1][j+1][k - (j+1)]` modulo `mod` after adding it to the previous value. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0**
