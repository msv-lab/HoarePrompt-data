Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m, s` are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, if `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
