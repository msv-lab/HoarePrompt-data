Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` remains not equal to 0. The final values of `dp` will depend on the conditions within the loop, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations performed in the loop for all iterations.**
