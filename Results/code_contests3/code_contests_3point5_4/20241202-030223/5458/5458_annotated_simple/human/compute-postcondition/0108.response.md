According to the code, the loop can execute for values of i ranging from 0 to (n ** 2) - 1. At the end of the last iteration, the values of N, M, S, mod, i, j, k need to be considered for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, i should be incremented by 1 within the range of 0 to (n ** 2) - 1.
State: **N, M, S, mod, i+1, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000**.
