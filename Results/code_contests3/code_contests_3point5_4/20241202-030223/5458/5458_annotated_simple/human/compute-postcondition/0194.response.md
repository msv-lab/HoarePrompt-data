Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. If j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], indicating that the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the values of k, s, i, j are adjusted to accommodate the additional loop iteration.***
