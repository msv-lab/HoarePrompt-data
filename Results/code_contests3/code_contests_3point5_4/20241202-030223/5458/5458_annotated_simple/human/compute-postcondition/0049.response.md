Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is between 1 and S inclusive, and i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k**
