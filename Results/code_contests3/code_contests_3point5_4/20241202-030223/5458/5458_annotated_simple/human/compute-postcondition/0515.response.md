Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Since the initial state of all variables is provided and the calculation involves modulo operations, the exact values of the variables cannot be determined without additional context. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the assignment.
Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the assignment**
