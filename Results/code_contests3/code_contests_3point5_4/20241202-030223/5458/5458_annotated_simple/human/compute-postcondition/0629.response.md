According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the final value of `dp[n]` is not affected, so it remains the same. The loop will start with `k` as 1, so `k` needs to be set to 1. `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so they do not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
