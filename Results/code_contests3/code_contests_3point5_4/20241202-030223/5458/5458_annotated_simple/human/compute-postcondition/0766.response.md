Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains unchanged, the new values for the variables are as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `n`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged, and the `dp` values are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s (inclusive)**
