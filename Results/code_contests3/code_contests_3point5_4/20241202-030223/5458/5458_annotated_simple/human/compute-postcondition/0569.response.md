Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 2. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
