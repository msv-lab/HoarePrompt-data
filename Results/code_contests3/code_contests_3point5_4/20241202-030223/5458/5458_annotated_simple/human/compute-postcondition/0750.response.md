Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j` is greater than `k`, otherwise it is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, while `i` and `j` are adjusted based on the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` and `j` are adjusted based on conditions, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated and calculated based on specified conditions.**
