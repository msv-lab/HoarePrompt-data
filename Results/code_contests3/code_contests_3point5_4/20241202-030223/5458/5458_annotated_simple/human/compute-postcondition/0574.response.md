Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers**
