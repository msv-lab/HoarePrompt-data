Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1 if j >= k, else no changes occur to the variables. If i != 0, N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k should be less than or equal to S, updated values of dp.***
