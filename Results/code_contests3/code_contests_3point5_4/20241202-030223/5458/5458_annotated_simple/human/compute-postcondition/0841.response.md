Output State: **`n`, `m` are greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is now `s`, `dp` values are updated, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
