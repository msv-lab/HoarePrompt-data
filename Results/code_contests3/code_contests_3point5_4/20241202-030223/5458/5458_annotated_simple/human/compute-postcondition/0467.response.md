Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, and `j` remain the same. `k` is increased by 1. Since the values of other variables are not affected, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, and `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned, and `k` is increased by 2.**
