Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the variables are needed to calculate the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, and the assignment operation described in the code snippet has been executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s`, the assignment operation described in the code snippet has been executed**
