Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is increased by 1. In the if part, the values remain the same. In the else part, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; `k` is increased by 1 if `j > k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
