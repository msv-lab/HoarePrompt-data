Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k, m, s, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. If `j > k`, then `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` remain 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
