Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` >= `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1, and if `j` > `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration.***
