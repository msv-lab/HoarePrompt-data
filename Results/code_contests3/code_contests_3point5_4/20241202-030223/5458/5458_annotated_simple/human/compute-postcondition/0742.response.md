Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0, then `i` is updated to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
