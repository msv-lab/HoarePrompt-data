According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be updated to `k+1`, and since `k` starts at 1, `k` is now 2. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i+1` and `j+1` are updated accordingly.**
