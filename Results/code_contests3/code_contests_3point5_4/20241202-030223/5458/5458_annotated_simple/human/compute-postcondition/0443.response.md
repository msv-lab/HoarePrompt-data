Example Answer:
The value of `k` is increased by 1. Then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all equal to 1; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is increased by 1**
