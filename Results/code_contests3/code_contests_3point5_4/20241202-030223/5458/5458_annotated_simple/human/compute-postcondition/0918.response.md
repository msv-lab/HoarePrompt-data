Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp` values are updated. When `j >= k`, the dp array at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The `dp` values are updated based on the mentioned conditions.***
