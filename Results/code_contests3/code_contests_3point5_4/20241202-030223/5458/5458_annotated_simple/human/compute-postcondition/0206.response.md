Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i, j, k` are all integers incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0, after the execution, `k` is incremented by 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is further incremented by 3. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod.***
