Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i remain as positive integers where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000. For the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is 1. If j is greater than k, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or skips the current iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
