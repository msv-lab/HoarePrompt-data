Output State: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 3, k is the next value after the last iteration of the loop. If i == 0, dp[1][3][1] is equal to 1, and j is updated to 3. The code snippet updates the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. No other variables are affected by this assignment.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 3, k is the next value after the last iteration of the loop, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
