Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i + 1` and `j + 2` are integers, the new values of `i` and `j` are `i + 1` and `j + 2` respectively. The `&` operator is a bitwise AND operator, and `1 & 1` equals 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
