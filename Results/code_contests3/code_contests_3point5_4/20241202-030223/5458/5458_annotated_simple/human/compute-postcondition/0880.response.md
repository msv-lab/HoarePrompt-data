Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is at least 2.
