Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k, m, s, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers. If `j >= k`, the output state will be `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`.***
