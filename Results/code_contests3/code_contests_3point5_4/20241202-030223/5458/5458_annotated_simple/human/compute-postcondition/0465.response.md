Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.***
