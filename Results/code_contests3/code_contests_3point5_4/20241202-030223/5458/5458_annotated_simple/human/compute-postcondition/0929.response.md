Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `s + 1`, `dp` values are updated. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` remain as in the initial state, `dp` values are updated based on the conditions within the loop. The loop will execute until `j` reaches `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.**
