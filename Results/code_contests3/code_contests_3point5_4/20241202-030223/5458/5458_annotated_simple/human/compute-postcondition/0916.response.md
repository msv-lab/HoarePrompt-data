Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` > `k`, then `i` must be 0 and `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. The `dp` values are updated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If `j` > `k`, then `i` must be 0 and `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. The `dp` values are updated based on the conditions mentioned.**
