Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` must be 2. The final values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be based on the conditions mentioned in the loop code. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations mentioned in the loop code.**
