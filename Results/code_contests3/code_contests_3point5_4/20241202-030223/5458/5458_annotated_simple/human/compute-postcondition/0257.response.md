According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, m` remain the same.
- If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 
- If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`.**
