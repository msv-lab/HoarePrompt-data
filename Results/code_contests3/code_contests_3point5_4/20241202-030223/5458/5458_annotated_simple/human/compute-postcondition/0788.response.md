Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all the variables are within the range of 1 to `s`, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be based on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration**
