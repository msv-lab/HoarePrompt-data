Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are at least 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
