Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Based on the initial state, where n, m, s, k, i+1 are all equal to 1, j is 2, and m is greater than or equal to 1, the calculation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be based on these initial values. 
Output State: **n, m, s, k, i+1 are all equal to 1; m is greater than or equal to 1; j is 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.**
