Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly given, so we cannot determine the exact values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1**
