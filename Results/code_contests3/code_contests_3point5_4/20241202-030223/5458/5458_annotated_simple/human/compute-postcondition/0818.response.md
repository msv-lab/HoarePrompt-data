According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is incremented by 1 and is within the range of 2 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated. The condition `j` is less than `m`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: *All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated. The condition `j` is less than `m`. The value of `k` should be within the range of 2 to `s` (inclusive).*
