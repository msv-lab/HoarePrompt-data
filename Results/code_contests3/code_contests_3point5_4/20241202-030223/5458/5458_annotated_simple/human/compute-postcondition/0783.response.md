Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1. All variables remain within the range of 1 to `s`. 
Output State: **All variables remain within the range of 1 to `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration.**
