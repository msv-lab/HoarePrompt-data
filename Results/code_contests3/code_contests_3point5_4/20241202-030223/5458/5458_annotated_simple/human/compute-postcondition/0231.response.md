Example Answer: 
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of the affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in values, program continues without any change.
Output State: **No change in values, program continues without any change**
