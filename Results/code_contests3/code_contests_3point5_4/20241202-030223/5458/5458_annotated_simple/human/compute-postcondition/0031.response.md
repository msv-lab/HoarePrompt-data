According to the code, the loop can execute one more time as long as k is less than or equal to S. At the end of the last iteration, N, M, S, mod, i, j, dp are as follows: N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is less than S, dp has been updated. For the next iteration, k needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is less than S+1, dp has been updated**
