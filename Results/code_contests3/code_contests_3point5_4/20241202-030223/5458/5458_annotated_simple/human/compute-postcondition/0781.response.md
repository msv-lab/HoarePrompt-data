Postcondition: ***All variables remain within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). `i`, `j` are incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. If `j` is greater than `k`, there will be no change in the current state, and the program continues execution without any modifications.***
