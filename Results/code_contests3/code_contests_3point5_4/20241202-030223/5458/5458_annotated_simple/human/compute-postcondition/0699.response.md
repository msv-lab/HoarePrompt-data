Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` is less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
