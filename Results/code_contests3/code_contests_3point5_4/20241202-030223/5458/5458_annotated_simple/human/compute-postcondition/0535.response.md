Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` remain unchanged. The conditions for the loop execution are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`**
