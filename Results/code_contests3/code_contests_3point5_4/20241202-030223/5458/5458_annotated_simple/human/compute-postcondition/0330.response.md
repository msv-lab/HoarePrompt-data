Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
