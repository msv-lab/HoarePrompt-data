Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0`, `k` is increased by 2 if `j >= k`, else `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are all equal to 1. If `j > k`, the loop does not execute. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
