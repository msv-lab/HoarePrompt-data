Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i+1` are all 1. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` must not be equal to 0. Since the code does not mention any changes to these initial variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1.**
