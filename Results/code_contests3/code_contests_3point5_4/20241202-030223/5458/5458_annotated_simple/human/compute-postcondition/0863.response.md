According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `s + 1` and `m` is greater than or equal to `j`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `m` should be greater than `j` which means `m` should be greater than `s + 1`, `j` should be incremented by 1, and the rest of the states should be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, and `dp` values are updated**.
