Example Answer:
The code assigns the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since i, j, and k are not provided in the initial state, we cannot calculate the specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: *N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is not equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is 1. j is greater than k.
Output State: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is not equal to 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is 1. j is greater than k***.
