According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged. If `i == 0`, then `j >= k`. For the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**
