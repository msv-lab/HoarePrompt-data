Output State: `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0. The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The loop continues to execute until `k` reaches `s + 1`.
