Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged**
