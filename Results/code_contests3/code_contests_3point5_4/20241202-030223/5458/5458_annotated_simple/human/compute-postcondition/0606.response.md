Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=3`, `i+2`, `j+2`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+2][k]` are integers. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop executes. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
