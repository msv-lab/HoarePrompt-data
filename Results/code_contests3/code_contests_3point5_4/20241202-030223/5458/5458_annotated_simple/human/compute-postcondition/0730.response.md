According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times as `k` iterates from 1 to `s` inclusive. Before the loop starts, the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1` and `j` needs to be updated to `m + 1`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
