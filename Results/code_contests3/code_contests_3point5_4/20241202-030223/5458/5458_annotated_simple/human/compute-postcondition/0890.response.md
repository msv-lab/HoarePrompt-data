Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers equal to 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is at least 2, additional conditions for `dp` assignment are checked, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
