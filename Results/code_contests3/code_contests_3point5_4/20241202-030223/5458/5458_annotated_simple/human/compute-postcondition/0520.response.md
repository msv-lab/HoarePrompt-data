According to the code, the loop will iterate from 1 to m (inclusive). So for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Additionally, the loop depends on the variable `j`. Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to m, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m` is at least 1, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
