Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
