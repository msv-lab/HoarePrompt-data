Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, k, N, M, S, and mod remain the same. The output state is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, for the loop to execute again k+1 should be less than or equal to S, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
