According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to S inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, k should be updated to be within the specified range. Additionally, the initial values of i, j, N, M, and mod do not affect the loop execution. 
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is 1, for the loop to execute at least once k is between 1 and S inclusive**
