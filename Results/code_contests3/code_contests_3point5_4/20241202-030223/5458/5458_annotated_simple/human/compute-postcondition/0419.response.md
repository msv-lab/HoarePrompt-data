According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` being integers greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than or equal to 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
