Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, for the loop to execute the first time j is 1, k is 1. If j >= k, dp array is updated with the new value 1 at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. If j is greater than k, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or skips the current iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the provided Python code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
