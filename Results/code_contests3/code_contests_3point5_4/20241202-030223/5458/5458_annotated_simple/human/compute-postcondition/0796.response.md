According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times with `k` ranging from 1 to `s` (inclusive). In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented to `s`, `j` is less than `m`**
