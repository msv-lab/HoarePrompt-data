Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k + 1, m, s` are all integers. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 and `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k + 1` are set to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i != 0`, and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
