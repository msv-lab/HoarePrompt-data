Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of the variables are not explicitly given, but based on the calculation, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k+1 ≤ S, updated values of dp.
