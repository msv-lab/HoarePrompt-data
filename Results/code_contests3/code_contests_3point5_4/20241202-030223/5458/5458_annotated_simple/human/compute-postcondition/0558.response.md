Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k=2`, `i`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` and `j+1` are updated accordingly. When the program enters the if condition `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes one more time with updated values of `i` and `j+1`.***
