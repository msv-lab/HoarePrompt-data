Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `n`, `m` are greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the assignment.***
