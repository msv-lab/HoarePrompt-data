Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, updated `dp` values based on the logic within the loop. If `i == 0`, `dp` array is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j >= k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j > k`, the program maintains the same state and updates the `dp` array as described above. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
