Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration. If `i` is 0, then the program executes the if part, otherwise, it executes the else part where `k` is also incremented by 1.***
