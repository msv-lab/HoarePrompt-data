According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `S` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `S`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k` are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `S` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` must be 1. If `i == 0`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, then if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `S` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` needs to be less than `S + 1`.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` must be less than `S + 1`.**
