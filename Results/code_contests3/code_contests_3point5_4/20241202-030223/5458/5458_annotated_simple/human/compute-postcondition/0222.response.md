Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k are integers greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, S must be greater than or equal to 1 and k must be 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, if j > k, then the program continues with the updated values of N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**.
