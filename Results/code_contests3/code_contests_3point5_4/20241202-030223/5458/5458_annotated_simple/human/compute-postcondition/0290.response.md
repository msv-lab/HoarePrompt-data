According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k` less than or equal to `s` should be maintained.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
