According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than `S + 1`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j, k + 1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `S` is greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` must be less than `S + 1`**
