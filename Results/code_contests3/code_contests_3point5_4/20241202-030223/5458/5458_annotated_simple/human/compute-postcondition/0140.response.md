Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are all integers. For the loop to execute again, S must be greater than 0. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 and j > k, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the modulo operation of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.***
