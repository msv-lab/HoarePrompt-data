Output State: **At the end of the loop, the final values of the variables will depend on the logic and calculations performed within the loop. The final state will involve the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, and the updated values of `dp`. The value of `dp` will be determined based on the conditions and calculations within the loop.**
