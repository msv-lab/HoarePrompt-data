Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. Depending on the conditions within the loop, the values of the variables will be updated accordingly. The final values will depend on the specific conditions met during the iterations of the loop, and the final state will be a result of these conditions.**
