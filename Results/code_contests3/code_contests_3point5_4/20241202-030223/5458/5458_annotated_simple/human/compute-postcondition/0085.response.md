Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged. If `j > k`, then `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k is incremented by 1 if j > k.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k is incremented by 1 if j > k**
