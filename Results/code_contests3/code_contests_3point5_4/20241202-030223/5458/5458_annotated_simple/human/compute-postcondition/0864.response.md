According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, and `dp` values are already properly initialized. The only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `k` needs to be set to 1 for the loop to start at the correct index.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
