Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, so the output state is: N, M, S are positive integers where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, and mod is 100000. i, j, k remain the same.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, and mod is 100000. i, j, k remain the same**
