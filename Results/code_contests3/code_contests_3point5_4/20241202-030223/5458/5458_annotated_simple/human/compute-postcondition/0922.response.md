Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are not affected by this assignment. After execution, the values of `i`, `j` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is less than `s`**
