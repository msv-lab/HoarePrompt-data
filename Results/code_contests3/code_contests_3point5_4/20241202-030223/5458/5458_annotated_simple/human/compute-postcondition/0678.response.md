Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The variables i, j, and k are involved in the assignment, but their initial values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, and the assignment operation mentioned has taken place.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 1`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers greater than 0, `k + 1` is less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, and the assignment operation mentioned has taken place.**
