Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute one more time to update the values. The previous values of `dp` are updated based on the logic within the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: updated `dp` values based on the logic within the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will execute one more time for the values to be updated.
Output State: **updated `dp` values based on the logic within the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will execute one more time for the values to be updated.**
