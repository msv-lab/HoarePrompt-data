Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are incremented by 1, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated. If `j >= k`, and `i == 0`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j >= k` and `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Otherwise, if `j > k`, no variables are changed, and the program continues execution as is.***
