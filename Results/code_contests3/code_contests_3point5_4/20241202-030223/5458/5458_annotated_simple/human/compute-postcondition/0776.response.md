According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the next iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be within the range of 1 to `s` and `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive), `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` values are updated based on the loop conditions for the next iteration**.
