Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, but it is known that `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
