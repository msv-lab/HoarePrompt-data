Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` remains 1, `s` remains at least 1, `j + 2` remains less than or equal to `m + 1, `i` remains not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***
