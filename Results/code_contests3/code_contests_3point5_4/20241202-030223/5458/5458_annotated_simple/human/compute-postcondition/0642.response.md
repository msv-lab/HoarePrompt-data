According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than `s`. In the for loop, `k` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s + 1`.
State: **The final value of `dp[n]` is not affected. `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are all integers greater than 0. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`, while other variables remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s + 1**.
