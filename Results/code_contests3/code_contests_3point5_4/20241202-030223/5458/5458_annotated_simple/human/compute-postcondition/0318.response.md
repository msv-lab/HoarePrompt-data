According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to m+1, so for the loop to execute, `m` needs to be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is already greater than 0, so it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `m` is at least 1 and `s` is an integer assigned a value from the input after splitting.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer assigned a value from the input after splitting**
