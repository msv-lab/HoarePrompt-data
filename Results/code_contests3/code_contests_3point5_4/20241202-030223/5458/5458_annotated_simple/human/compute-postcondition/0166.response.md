Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the assignment, but their previous values are not explicitly provided. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k all adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k all adjusted based on the conditions mentioned above, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
