According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition k <= S is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are positive integers satisfying the given conditions. If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k are positive integers satisfying the given conditions. 
Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the updated values should be as follows:
State: **N, M, S, mod, i+1, j+1, k+1 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, k+1 ≤ S, updated values of dp**
