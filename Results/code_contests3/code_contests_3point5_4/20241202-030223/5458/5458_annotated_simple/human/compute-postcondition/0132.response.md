According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables S, i, j, k. At the end of the last iteration, S must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to s+1, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable k needs to be incremented. 
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k+1 are all integers for the loop to execute again, S must be greater than 0**
