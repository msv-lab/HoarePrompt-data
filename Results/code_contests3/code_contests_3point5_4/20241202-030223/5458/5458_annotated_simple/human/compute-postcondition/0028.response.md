Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 1, k is less than S. After the if else block executes, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
