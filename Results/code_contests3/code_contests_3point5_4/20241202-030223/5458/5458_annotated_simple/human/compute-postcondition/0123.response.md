According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables S, i, j, k. If S is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, S is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are all integers. For the loop to execute again, S must be greater than 0. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp array is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] set to 1. If i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is updated to dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod.**
