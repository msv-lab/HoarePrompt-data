Output State: **At the end of the loop, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` are integers. The final values of the variables will be determined by the conditions within the loop. If `i == 0`, the values will be updated based on the conditions involving `j` and `k`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j+1][k]` will be updated to the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` after all the iterations of the loop have finished.**
