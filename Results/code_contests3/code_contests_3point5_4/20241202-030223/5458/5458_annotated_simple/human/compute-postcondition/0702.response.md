Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` is less than or equal to `m + 1. `i` is not equal to 0 and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j + 2`, `s`, `k` are integers greater than 0, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j + 2` is less than or equal to `m + 1. `i` is not equal to 0 and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is executed.**
