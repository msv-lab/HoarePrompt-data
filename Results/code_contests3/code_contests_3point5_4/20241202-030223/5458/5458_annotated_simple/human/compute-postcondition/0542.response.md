Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute the next time, `j` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program does nothing and maintains the current state of the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j+1` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.***
