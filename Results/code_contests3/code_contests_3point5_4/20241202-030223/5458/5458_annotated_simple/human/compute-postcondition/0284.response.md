Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` remain 1, `m` is still greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is still greater than or equal to 1. `i` is still not equal to 0, and `j` is still greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 2, k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to `j + 2`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
