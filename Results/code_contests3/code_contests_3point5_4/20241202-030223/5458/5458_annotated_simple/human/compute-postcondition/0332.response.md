According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the values stored in the `dp` array. If the loop is to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` was updated to a value less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k + 1]` is assigned a new value.**
