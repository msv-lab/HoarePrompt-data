According to the code, the loop will execute s times where s is an integer greater than 0. The loop will start with k = 1 and increment k by 1 in each iteration until k reaches s + 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i` is incremented by `s * (s + 1)`, `j` is equal to `s + 3`, `dp` values are updated, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1**
