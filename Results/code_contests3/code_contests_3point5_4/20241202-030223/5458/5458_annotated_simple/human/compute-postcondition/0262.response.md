Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1, m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the if else block executes.***
