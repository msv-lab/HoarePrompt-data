Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000, i is 0, j is 2, k is less than S, dp has been updated with the new value 1. If i is 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. If i is not 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
