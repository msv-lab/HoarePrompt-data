Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated, `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 if `j >= k`, `j` should be less than or equal to `m+1`, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` after the if statement executes.***
