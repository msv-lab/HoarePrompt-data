Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are not affected by this operation. If j is greater than k, no changes occur in the program state. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, i, j, k, dp remain the same.
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, i, j, k, dp remain the same**
