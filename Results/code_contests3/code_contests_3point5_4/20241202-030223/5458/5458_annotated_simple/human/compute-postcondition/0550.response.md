Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+2` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s` at least 1 and `k` equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or continues with the current iteration if it is within a loop.
