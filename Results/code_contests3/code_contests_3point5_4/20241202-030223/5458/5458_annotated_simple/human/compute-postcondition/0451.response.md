Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the sum of all previous values modulo `mod`.**
