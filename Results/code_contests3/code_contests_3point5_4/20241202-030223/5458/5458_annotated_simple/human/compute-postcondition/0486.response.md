According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m` being greater than 1 doesn't directly impact the loop execution. However, for the loop to execute, `k` should be in the range of `1` to `s + 1`, which means `k` should be `1` initially. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is in the range of 1 to s + 1**
