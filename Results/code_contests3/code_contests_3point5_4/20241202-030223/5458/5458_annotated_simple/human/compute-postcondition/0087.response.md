Postcondition: ***N, M, S, mod, i, j, k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, mod is 100000. If i == 0, then there is no change in the values of N, M, S, mod, i, j, k. If i is not equal to 0, k is incremented by 1 if j > k, and dp is updated based on the given operation.***
