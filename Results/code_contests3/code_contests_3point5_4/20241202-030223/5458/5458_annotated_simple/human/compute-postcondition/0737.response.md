Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will continue. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
