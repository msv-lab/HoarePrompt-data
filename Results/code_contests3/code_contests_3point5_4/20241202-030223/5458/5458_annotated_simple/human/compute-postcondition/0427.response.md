Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly given, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is 1, `i+1` is 1, for the loop to execute `m` is greater than or equal to 1. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
