Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not given, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers, `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `j` is incremented by 1, if `i` is equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be less than or equal to `k`**
