Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive) and all incremented by 1. `dp` values are updated. The loop will execute until `j` is less than `m`. Depending on the conditions in the loop, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be calculated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
