Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than 0, `s` is at least 1. After the execution of the if-else block, `k` is incremented by 2, `i` is incremented by `s`, `j` is updated to be `s+1`, `dp` values are updated for the next iteration. If `j` is greater or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the updated values, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
