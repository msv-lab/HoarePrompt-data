According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `j` is being incremented by 1 in the loop statement, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` can be increased by 1. So, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1` are all equal to 1; for the loop to execute one more time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be calculated based on the conditions mentioned**
