Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` is 0, `j` is updated to `m + 1`, and if `j` is already greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `j` is updated to `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is now 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` remain unchanged, `i` is now 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
