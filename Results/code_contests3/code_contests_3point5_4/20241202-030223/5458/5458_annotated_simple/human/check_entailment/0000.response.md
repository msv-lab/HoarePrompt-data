Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the conditions specified in the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to iterate through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card squares and calculate the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created.

The program handles multiple datasets correctly, as it continues to read input until the condition `n == m == s == 0` is met.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and computes the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000 as required.
