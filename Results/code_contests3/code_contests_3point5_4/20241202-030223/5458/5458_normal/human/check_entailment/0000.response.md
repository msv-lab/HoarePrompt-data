Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints in the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to fill a 3D array `dp` and calculates the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created based on the input values of N, M, and S.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the integers in each square of the Bingo card are within the specified range, the sum of integers on the Bingo card is equal to S, and the integers in each column are arranged in ascending order from top to bottom.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and outputs the correct result for each dataset provided.
