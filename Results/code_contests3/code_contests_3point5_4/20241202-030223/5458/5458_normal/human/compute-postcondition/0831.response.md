According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `m`, and `j`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1**
