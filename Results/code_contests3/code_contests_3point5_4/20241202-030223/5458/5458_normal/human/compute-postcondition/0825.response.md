Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `k` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are not provided, so the output state is not deterministic.
Output State: **Output state is not deterministic.**
