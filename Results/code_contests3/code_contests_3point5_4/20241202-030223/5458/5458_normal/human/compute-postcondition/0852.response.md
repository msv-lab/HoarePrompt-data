Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1 and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i == 0`, no changes occur. If `i != 0`, then `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
