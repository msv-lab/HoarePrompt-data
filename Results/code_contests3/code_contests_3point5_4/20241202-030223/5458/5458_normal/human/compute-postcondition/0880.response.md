Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but based on the given initial state, we can infer that `j` is at least `m`, `k` is `k+2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m**
