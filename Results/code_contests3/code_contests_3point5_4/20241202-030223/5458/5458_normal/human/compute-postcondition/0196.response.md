Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `i` is 0, `j >= k + 1`, and now `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the updated value after performing the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
