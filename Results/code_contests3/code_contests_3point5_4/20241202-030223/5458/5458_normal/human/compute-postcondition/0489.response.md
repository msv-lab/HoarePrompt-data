Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The loop will execute one more time as `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, so the condition is met. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
