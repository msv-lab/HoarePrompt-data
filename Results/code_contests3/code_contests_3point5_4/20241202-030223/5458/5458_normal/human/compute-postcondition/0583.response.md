Example Answer:
The value of `j` is 2 and `k` is 1. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the line `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is not executed. Therefore, there is no change in the values of the variables. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with values 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `m` is 1. If `j > k`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
