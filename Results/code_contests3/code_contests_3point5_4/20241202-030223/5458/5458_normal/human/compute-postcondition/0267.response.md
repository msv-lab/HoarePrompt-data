Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The other variables `j`, `s`, `k` remain the same as their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1**
