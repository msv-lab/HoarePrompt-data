Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive). When `i` is equal to 0, if `j >= k`, then `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the program variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
