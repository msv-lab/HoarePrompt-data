Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the remainder of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. Since no initial state is given, the specific values of the variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes are made to the variables, as `j > k`.
Output State: **No changes are made to the variables, as `j > k`**
