According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`.

State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`**
