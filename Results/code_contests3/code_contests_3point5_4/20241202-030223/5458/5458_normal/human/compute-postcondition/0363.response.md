Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`**.
