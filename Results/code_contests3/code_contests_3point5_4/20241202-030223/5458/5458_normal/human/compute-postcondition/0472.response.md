Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain consistent with the previous iteration. If `j > k`, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated accordingly**
