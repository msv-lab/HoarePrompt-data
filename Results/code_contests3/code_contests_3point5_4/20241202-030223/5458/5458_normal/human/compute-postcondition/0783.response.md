Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] after the if else block executes. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
