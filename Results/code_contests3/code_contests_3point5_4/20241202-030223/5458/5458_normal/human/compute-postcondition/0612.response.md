Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`**
