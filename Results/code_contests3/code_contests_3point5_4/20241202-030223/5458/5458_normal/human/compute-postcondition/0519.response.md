According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` and `k` remain the same**
