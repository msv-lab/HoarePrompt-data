According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `m` and `j`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. So for the loop to be executed, `m` must be at least 1 and `j` is set to 1.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
