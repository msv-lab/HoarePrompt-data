According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. 

For the loop to execute a second time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be increased by 1 from 2 to 3.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
