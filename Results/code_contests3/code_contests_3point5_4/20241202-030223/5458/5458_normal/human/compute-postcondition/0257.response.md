According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s, and `j` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is currently s, it needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop. 
State: **`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s + 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m**`
