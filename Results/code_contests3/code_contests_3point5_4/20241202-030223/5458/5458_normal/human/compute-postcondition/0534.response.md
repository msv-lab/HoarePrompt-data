According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1. The loop has executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1. The loop has executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2**.
