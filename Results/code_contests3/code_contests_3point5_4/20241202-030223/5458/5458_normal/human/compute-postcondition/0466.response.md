According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions related to these variables. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, and the conditions related to `i` and `j` were met. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the next value of `k` needs to be considered within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive) and the necessary conditions related to `i` and `j` should still hold true. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be within the range 1 to `s`, and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain consistent with the previous iteration.**
