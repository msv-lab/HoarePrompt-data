Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown, but the formula provides the calculation method. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same as 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer, and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on the provided formula.
