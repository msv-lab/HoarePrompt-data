Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `j` is greater than `k`, so the loop continues without any changes to the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, and the loop continues.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, and the loop continues**
