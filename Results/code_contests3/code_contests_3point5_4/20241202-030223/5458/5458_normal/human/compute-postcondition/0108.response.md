According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state for the next iteration will be:
State: **At the end of the loop execution, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain positive integers**.
