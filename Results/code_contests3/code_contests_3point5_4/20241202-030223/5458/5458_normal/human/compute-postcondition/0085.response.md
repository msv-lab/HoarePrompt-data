Output State: **At the end of the if else block, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are increased by 1, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified within the loop, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j > k`, then the condition is true. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
