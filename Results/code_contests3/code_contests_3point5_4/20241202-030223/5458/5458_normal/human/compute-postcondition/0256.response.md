Postcondition: ***`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes certain operations. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, different operations are executed on the program variables.***
