Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers. If `j >= k`, then the values of `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are updated based on the conditions described for `i` being equal to 0 or not. If `i` is 0, `k` is updated to `k+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `k+1` is updated based on the given assignments and calculations, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly. If `j` is greater than `k`, the variables remain unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of the previous value with `mod`.***
