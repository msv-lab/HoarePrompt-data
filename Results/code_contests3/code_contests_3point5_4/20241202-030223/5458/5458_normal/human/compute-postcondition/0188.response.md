Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is less than `m`. Additionally, after the if statement executes, `i` is equal to 0. If `j >= k`, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`***
