Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. `i` is updated based on loop conditions. `n` is squared for the last iteration. `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is 2 and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
