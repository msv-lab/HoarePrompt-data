Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain consistent with the previous iteration, and `k + 1` is within the range 1 to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers and the loop executes one more time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers and the loop executes one more time**
