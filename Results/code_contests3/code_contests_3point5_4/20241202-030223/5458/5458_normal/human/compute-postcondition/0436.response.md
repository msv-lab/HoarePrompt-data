Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` values are not changed, the output state will be the same as the initial state with the only change being the values of `dp`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. At the beginning, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` are all 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). The values of `dp` have been updated based on the assignment statement.**
