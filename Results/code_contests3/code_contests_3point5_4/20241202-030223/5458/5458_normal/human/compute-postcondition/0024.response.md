Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. If `j >= k` and `i == 0`, `j` is updated to 2, `k` is updated to 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
