Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 or `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
