According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. The loop will run for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. To execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`**
