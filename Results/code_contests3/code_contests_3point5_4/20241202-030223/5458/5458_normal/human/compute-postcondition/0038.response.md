Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation**.
