Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m`. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains the same. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, after the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
