Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, which are 0, `m+1`, and `k+1` respectively. Therefore, the updated value of `dp` is set to 1 at the corresponding indices. 
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
