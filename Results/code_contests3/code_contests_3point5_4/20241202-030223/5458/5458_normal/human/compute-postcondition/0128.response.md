Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no change in the variables.***
