Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `j` is incremented by 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is also incremented by 2. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned a new value based on the previous state, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k`.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned a new value based on the previous state, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k`**
