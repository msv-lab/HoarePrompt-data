Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `m` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the program state remains unchanged.***
