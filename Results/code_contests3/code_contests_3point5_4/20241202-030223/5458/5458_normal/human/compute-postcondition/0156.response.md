According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the loop continues normally. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.**
