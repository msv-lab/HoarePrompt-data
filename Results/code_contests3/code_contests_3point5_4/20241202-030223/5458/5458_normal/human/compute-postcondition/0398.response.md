According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `i`. If `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `k` is less than `s`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Considering the loop incrementing `k` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should now be less than `s` and remain greater than or equal to 1.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` are greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than `s`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1**
