Postcondition: ***All variables are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. The value printed is the result of `dp[n]`. `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute `k+1` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, the program continues to execute the loop. If `i` is not equal to 0, after the if block executes, `j` is greater than `k+1`. Additionally, if `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, adjust the values of `j` and update the values of `dp` accordingly.***
