Postcondition: ***All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` = 1. The value printed is the result of `dp[n]`. If `i` equals 0, no changes occur. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
