Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased. Otherwise, there are no changes in the variables.***
