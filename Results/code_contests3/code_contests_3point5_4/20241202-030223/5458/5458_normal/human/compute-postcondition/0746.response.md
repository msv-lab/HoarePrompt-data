Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` is updated to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2 for the next iteration. Since `n` is squared for the next iteration, the state of `n` is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated to 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated to 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
