Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, so the output state is: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration**
