According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is incremented by 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 2 and `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
