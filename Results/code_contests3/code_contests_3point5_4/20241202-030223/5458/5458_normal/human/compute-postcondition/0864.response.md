According to the code, the loop can execute if the range `s` is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be `k+1` and `j` should be less than `m`.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m`**
