Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is 0, all variables remain 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is updated to the next integer in the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). If `i` is not 0, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `i` remain 0, `j` remains 2, and `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
