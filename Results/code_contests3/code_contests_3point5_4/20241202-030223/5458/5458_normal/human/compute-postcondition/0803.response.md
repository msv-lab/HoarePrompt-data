Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The bitwise operation `&` and the addition operations are performed based on the previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since the operation is based on the previous values, the output state is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the next time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the next time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
