According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. To ensure the loop executes, `k` needs to be set to 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
