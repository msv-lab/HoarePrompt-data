According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`, which means for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`.
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. The final values of `dp` will depend on the conditions met during the loop execution. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then the corresponding `dp` value will be 1. Otherwise, the `dp` values will be updated based on the calculations within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`**
