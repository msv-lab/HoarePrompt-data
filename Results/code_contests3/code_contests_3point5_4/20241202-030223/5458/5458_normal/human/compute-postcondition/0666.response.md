Postcondition: ***All variables are integers where n > 0, m >= 1, s >= 1, the value printed is the result of dp[n], j is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s inclusive, i is 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, the program continues to execute the loop. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
