Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**
