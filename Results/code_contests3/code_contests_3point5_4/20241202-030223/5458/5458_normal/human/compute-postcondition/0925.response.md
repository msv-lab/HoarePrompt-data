Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
