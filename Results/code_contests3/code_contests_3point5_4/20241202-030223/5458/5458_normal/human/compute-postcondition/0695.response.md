According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`, so the value of `dp[n]` needs to be updated. Additionally, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`**
