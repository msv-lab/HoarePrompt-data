According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and the values stored in `dp`. 

If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` using the `mod` value.

At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
