Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial state assigns `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` to 1 and increments `k` by 1. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have the value 1 and `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
