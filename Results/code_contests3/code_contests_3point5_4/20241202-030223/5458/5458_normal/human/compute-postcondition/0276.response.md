According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to m+1 based on the variable `j`. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `j`, `s`, and `k` remain the same. The `dp` array is updated inside the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, the values of the variables `j`, `s`, and `k` remain the same as their initial values. The values of the `dp` array are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1**.
