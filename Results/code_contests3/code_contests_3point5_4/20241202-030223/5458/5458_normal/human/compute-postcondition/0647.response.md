Postcondition: ***All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` = 1, for the loop to execute again `k` is less than or equal to `s. If `j` is greater than `k`, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
