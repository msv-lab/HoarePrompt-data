Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0 and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been performed.
Output State: **`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0 and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` has been performed**
