Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `k` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `k` is incremented by 1**
