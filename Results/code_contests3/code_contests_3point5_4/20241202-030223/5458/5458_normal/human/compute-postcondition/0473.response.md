Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated accordingly**
