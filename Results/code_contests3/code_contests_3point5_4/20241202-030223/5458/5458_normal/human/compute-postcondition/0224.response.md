According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
