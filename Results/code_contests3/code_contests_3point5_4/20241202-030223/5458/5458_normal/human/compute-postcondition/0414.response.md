Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` are greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` is less than `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain unchanged and the program continues to the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`.**
