Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are increased by 1 and the `dp` array is modified. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are increased by 1, `dp` array is modified, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are increased by 1, `dp` array is modified, `s` is greater than 0**
