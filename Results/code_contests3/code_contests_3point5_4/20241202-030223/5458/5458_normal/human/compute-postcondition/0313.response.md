Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned by mapping the integers obtained from splitting the input. No previous values are provided, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input**
