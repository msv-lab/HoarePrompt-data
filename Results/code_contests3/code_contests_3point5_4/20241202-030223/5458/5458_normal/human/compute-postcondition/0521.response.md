According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop execution, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` are all 1, `j` remains the same, and `k` remains the same. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is 1, `dp` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` remains the same, `k` remains the same, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1**
