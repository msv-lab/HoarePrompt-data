Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i` is updated to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2, the new values will be used in the assignment. The value of `dp[1][2][2]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is 1.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is 1**
