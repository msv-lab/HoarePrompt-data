According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 ensures the loop will execute, and the loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least 1 and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` is 1, `k` are integers, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
