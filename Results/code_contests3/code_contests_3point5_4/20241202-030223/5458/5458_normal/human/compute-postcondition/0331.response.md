Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated accordingly. If `j >= k`, then j is greater than or equal to k. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are updated based on the given assignments and calculations.***
