Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial states of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `k` is 1 and within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive) for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `k` is 1 and within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive) for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
