Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from the input after being split. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are integers, so they are correctly assigned. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Final values of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers, and the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`.
Output State: **Final values of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers, and the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
