Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program state.***
