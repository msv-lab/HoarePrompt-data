According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated to 1 as i == 0, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. Since the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated to 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
