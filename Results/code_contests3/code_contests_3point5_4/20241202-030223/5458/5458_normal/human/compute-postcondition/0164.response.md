Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the loop continues normally. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, or `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
