Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, so the value of `j` changes. The values of `s` and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
