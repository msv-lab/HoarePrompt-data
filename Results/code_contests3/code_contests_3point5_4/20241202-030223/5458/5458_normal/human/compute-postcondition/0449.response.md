Example Answer:
The formula updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables maintain their initial values. If `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated according to the formula provided. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the variables maintain their initial values. If `i` is not 0, then `dp` is also updated according to the formula provided.**
