Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is less than `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1. The loop will update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions provided in the loop code for each iteration until `j` reaches `m + 1` and `k` reaches `s + 1`.**
