According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `j + 1`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1**
