Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented by 1, so the new state of `dp` is updated accordingly. Since `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
