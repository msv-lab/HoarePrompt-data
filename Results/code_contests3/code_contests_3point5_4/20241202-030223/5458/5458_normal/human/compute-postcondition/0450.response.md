Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. If `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i` remain 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is updated to the next integer in the range of 1 to `s`. If `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not 0, the variables maintain their initial values, `j` remains 2, `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`, and `dp` is updated according to the provided formula.***
