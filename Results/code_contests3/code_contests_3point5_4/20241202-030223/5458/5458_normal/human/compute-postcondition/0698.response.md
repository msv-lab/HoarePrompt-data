Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` when the condition `j >= k` is true. The values of the variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is equal to 0**
