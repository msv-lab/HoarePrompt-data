Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are like this: At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.
