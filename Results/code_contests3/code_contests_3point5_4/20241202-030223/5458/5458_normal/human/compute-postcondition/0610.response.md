Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact values of the affected variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`**
