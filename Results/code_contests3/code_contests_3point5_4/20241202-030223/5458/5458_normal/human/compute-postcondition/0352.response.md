According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n`, `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, and `k` is now 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
