Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. As all the variables are greater than or equal to 1, and the loop conditions are met, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 1.
Output State: **All variables remain greater than or equal to 1, and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
