According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). Therefore, we need to adjust the states to ensure that `k` is within this range. Before the loop starts, we need to set `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1` to be integers and `k` to be 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1` are integers, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive)**
