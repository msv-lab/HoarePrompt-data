According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, j is m, so for the loop to execute one more time, j should be less than or equal to m. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and j is less than or equal to m.
State: **`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute**
