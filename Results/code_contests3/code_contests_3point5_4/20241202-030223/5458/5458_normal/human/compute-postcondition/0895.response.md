Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the calculation based on the loop code is performed.**
