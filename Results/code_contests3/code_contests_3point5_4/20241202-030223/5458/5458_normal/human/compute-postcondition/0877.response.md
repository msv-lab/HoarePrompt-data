According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and `k`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+1`, `s` is at least 1. We also have the conditions based on `i`, `j`, and `k` that affect the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `j` is `m+1` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`. So, `j` should be decremented by 1.
2. The value of `k` should be incremented by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.
3. The other states remain the same as they are not affected by the loop conditions.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m**`.
