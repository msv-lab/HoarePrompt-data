Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1. The loop has executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j+1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
