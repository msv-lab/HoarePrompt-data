According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified. For the loop to execute again `s` must be greater than 0. If `i` is 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0**.
