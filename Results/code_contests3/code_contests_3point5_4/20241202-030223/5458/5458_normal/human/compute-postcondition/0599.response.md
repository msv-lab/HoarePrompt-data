Postcondition: ***`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, dp values are determined within the loop for each iteration. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is updated to 4. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] has been updated according to the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`***.
