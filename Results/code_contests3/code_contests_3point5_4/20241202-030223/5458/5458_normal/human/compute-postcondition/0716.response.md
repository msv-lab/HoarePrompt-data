Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above. If `i` is 0, then the program updates `dp[n]`, increases `j` by 1, ensures `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and updates `i` based on the conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the program updates `dp[n]`, increases `j` by 1, ensures `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, and updates `i` based on the conditions mentioned.***
