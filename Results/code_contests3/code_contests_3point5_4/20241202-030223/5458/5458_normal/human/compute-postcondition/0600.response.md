According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` would be the current value of `k` plus 1.
State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration**
