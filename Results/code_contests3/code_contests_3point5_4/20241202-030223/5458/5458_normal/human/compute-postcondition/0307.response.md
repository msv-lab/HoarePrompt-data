Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then at the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
