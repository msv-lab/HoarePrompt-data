Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the result cannot be calculated explicitly. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. For the loop to execute again `k+1` is less than or equal to `s. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
