Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `mod` is a positive integer. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned 1. If `j > k`, the program retains the initial state described in the precondition without any changes.***
