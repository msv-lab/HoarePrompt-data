Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain the same. The variable `mod` is not provided in the initial state, so it is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. For the loop to execute again `k+1` is less than or equal to `s. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the same state.
