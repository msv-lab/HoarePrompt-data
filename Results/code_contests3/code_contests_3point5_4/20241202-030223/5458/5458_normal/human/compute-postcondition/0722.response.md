Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
