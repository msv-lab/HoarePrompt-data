Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the third time, `k` is 3. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. In the else part, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
