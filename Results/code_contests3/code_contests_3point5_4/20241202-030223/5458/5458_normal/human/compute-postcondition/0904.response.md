Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
