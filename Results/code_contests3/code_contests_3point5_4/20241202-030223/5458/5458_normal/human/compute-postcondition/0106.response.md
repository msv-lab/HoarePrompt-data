Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are all increased by 1, `dp` array is modified within the loop. The loop will execute at least once if `s` is greater than 0. If `i == 0` after the loop, then `i` will be 0. If `j >= k` after the loop, then `j` will be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0 after the loop, and `j > k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and it will accumulate the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for each iteration of the loop.**
