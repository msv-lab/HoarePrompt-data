Example Answer: 
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since the initial state mentions that i = 0 when the if condition is satisfied, the new value of i will be 1 (i + 1). The value of j is increased by 1 as well. The value of k remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` is 1. When the if condition is satisfied, `i` is equal to 1. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
