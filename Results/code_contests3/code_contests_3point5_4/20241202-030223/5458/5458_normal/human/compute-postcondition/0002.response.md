Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000**
