Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the loop updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` while `j` is greater than `k` and the loop continues executing.***
