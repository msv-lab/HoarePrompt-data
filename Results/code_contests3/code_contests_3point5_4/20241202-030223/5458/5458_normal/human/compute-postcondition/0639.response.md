Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where mod is a constant value. Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, `k` are 1, and `mod` is not given, we cannot determine the specific value of `dp[n]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` = 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` = 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
