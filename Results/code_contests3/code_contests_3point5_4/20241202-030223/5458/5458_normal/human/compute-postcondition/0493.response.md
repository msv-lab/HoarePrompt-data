Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. The output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k**.
