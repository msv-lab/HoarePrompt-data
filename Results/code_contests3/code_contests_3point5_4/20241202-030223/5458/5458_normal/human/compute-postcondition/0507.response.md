Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, no changes occur to the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues without altering the variables. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
