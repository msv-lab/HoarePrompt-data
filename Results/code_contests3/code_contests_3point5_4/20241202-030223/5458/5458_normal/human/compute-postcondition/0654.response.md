Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The bitwise AND operation `&` with 1 is used to toggle between 0 and 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. For the loop to execute again `k+1` is less than or equal to `s.
Output State: **All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. For the loop to execute again `k+1` is less than or equal to `s.**
