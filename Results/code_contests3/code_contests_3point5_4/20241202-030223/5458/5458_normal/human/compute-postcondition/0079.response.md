Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` are increased by 1, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified within the loop, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0. When the if condition `(i == 0)` is true, the value of `i` is 0. Additionally, when the if condition `(j >= k)` is true, the value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
