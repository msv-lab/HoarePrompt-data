Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `mod` is a positive integer. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. If `i` equals 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` follows a specific formula based on the conditions provided.***
