Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the assignment of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
