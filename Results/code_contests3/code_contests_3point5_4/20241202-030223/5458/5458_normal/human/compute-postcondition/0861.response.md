Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value 1 and then increased. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated based on the given formula, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased accordingly after applying the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
