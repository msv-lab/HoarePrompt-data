According to the code, the loop will iterate from 1 to m inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, j will be equal to m. For the loop to execute one more time, j must be less than m+1, which means j should be less than or equal to m. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be:
State: **At the end of the loop, j is m, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than or equal to m**
