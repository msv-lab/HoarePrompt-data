Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the updated values. The previous state of the variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers. `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation.**
