According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so `k` becomes 2 and it should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2. When the if condition is satisfied, `i` is equal to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. When the else condition is satisfied, `i` is not equal to 0, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula mentioned.**
