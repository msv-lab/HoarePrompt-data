Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are greater than or equal to 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are incremented by 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` equals 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
