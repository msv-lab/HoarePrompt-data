Output State: **N is a positive integer between 1 and 7, M is a positive integer such that 1 <= M <= 2000, S is a positive integer such that 1 <= S <= 3000, j is 1, k is 1, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0. Moreover, j is greater than k. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
