Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, after the if condition `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and the loop continues executing**
