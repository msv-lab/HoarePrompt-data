Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are updated based on the loop conditions. `n` is squared for the last iteration. `m` is at least 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with modulo `mod`.**
