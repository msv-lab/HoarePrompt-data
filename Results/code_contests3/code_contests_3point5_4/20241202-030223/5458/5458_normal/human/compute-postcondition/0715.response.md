Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The conditions for the loop execution are based on the range of `k` being from 1 to `s`. The value of `i` is updated based on these conditions. 
Output State: **`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is increased by 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
