Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i == 0`, the values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` where `j >= k` are assigned 1. If `i != 0`, the loop updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions provided in the code.**
