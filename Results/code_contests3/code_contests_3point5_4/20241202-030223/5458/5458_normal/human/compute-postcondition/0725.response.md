Postcondition: ***After the if else block, `dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above. If i is equal to 0, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If i is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the calculated value. In both cases, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, while `i` is updated based on the conditions.***
