Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their specific values are not provided, so the resulting value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is dependent on the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are all greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than 2, the loop executes a second time.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are all greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than 2, the loop executes a second time**.
