Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` and prints the result. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain positive integers, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions within the loop. The final calculated value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed.
Output State: **The final calculated value of dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod is printed.**
