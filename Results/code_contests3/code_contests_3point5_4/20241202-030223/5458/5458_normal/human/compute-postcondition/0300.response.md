Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if the condition `i == 0` and `j >= k` is satisfied. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are incremented or updated as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If the condition `i == 0` and `j >= k` is met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
