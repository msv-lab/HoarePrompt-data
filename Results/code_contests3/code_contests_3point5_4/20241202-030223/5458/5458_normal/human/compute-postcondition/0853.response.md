According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. Since no changes occur if `i == 0`, we need to focus on the case where `i != 0`. In this case, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1 and `k` should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased**
