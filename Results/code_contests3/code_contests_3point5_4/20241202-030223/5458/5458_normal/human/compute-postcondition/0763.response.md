According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be set to 1 to indicate the start of the loop. Additionally, `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop can execute. 
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute**
