According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `k` will be equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` and `k` need to remain greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be less than `s`.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, where `s` and `k` remain greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than `s`**
