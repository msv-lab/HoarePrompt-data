Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes. Otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
