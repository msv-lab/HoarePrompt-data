Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time where `s` and `k` remain greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, then after the if condition, `i` becomes 0. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The specific position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then after the else condition, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
