According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. At the end of the loop execution, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` are incremented by 1. So, before the loop starts, the values need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **At the end of the loop execution, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is 1, `dp` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` remains the same, `k` remains the same**
