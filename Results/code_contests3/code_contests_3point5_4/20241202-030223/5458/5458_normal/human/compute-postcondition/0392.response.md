Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time, where `s` and `k` remain greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is less than `s`, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
