Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is 3, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the if-else block executes, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` includes the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` after the update.***
