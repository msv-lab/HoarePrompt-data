Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
