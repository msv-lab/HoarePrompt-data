Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The value of `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to continue. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same as 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the provided formula.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same as 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the provided formula**
