Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated to 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
