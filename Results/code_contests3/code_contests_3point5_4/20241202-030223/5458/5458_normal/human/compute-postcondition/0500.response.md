Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. This means that the value 1 is stored in the specific position in the dp array. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s, dp, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers.
Output State: **n, m, s, dp, i, j + 1, k + 1 are integers**
