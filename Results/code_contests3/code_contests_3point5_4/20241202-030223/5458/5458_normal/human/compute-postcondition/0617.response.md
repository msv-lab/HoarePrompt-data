Postcondition: ***`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`. If `i == 0`, the program does one thing, otherwise, if `j > k`, the program does another thing.***
