Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `m` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
