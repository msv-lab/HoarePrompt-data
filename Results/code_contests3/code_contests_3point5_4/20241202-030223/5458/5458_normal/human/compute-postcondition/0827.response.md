Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with modulo `mod`.**
