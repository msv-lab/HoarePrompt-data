Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s + 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m.
Output State: **`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s + 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m**
