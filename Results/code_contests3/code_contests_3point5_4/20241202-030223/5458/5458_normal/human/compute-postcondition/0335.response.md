Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k+1` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers**
