Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The values of i, j, and k are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[n] contains the final calculated value, m is at least 1, j is less than m, k is k + 2, s is at least 1.
Output State: **dp[n] contains the final calculated value, m is at least 1, j is less than m, k is k + 2, s is at least 1**
