Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` is 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `mod` is a positive integer. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` is 1. `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `mod` is a positive integer. `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
