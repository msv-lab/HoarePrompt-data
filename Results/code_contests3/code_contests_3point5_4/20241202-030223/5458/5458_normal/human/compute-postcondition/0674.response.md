Postcondition: ***All variables are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of `1` to `s` inclusive. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues to execute the loop. If `i` is not equal to 0, after the if else block executes, `j` is greater than `k`.***
