Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
