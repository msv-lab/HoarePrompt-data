Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` remain the same as 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `mod` is a positive integer. If `j > k`, the loop continues, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.***
