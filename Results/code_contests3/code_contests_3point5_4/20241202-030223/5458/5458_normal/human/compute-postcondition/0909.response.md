Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, the function continues with the given conditions. Otherwise, the function terminates without making any changes.***
