Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the next time, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, then the loop will execute with `j` being greater than `k`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` using the `mod` value.**
