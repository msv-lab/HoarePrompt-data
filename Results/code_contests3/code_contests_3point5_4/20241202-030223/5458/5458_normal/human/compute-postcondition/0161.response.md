Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. If `j > k`, no changes are made to the variables, and the program proceeds to the next line of code. Otherwise, the loop continues normally, and `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
