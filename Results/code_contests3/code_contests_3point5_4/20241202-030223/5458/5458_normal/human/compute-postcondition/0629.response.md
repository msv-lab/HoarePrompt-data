According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times with `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are 1, and `k` are integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `s` to be at least 1 and `k` to be 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp`, `i`, `j` are 1, `k` is 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
