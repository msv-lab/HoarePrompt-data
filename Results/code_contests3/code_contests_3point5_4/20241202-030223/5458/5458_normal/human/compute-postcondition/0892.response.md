Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `mod`, and other variables are not explicitly given, so we cannot calculate the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is `k + 2`, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration.
