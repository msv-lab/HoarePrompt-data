Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. After the if statement executes, if `j` is greater than 2, no changes occur. If `j` is less than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
