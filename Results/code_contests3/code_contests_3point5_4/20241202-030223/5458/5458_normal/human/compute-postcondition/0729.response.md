According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `m` and `j`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` will contain the final calculated value. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as integers with `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1 and `j` is 1**
