According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k + 1` is within the range 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k + 1` is an integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be within the range 1 to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be within the range 1 to `s`, and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain consistent with the previous iteration.**
