According to the code, the loop will iterate `n ** 2` times, and the loop execution depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `i` should be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to continue.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, for the loop to execute a (current iteration + 1) time `i` should be less than `n ** 2`**
