Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is 3, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
