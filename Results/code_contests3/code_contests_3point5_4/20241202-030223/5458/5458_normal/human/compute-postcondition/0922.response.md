Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not explicitly mentioned, but `m` is at least 1 and `j` is less than `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
