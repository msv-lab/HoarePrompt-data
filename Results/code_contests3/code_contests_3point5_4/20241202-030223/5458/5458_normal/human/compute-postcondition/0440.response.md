Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `i` remain 0, `j` remains 2, `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i` remain 0, `j` remains 2, `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly**
