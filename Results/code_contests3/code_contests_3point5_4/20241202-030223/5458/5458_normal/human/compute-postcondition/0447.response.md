Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the variables maintain their initial values as described in the precondition. Additionally, the values of `k` are updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `i` is not 0, then `dp` is also updated based on the values of the other variables.***
