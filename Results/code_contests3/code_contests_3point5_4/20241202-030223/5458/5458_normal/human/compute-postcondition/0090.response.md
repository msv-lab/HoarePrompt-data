Postcondition: ***At the end of the if else block, `N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.***
