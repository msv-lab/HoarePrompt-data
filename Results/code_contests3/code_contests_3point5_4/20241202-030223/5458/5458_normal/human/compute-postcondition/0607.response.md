Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `dp` are not provided, so the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` cannot be calculated explicitly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. If `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
