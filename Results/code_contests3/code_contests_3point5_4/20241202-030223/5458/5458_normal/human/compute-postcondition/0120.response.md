Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `N, M, S, i, j, s, mod, m` remain unchanged. The condition `j > k` is not specified, so the output state is:
Output State: **N, M, S, i, j, s, mod, m, k are positive integers, m is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1, i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula mentioned.**
