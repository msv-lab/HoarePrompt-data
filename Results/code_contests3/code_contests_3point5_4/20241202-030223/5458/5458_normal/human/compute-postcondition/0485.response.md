According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j + 1` is the value of `j` in the previous iteration incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m**`
