Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then it is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are known, so the calculation can be done accordingly.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
