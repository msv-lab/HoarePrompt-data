According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, so it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute**
