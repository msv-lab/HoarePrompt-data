Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 2][j + 2][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than 2, the loop executes a second time.***
