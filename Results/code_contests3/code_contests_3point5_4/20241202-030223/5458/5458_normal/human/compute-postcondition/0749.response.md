Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated to 1, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop executes one more time with the updated values. Otherwise, the loop terminates. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
