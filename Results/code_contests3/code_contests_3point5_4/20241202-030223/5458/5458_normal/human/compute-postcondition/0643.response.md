Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since all variables are integers and their initial values are 1, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, `i`, `j`, `k` = 1**
