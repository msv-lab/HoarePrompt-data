Output State: **All variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. For the loop to execute again `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Furthermore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
