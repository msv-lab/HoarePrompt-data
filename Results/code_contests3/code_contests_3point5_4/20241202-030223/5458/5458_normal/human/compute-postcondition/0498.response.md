Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain unchanged except for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated.***
