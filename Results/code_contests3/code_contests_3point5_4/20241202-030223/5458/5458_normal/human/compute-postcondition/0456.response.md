Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1 based on the least significant bit of `i + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k=1` are integers, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k=1` are integers, `k` is within the range 1 to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
