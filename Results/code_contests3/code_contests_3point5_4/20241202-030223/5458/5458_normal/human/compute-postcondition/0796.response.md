According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, and `m` is at least 1. For the next iteration, the value of `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. So, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the next time**
