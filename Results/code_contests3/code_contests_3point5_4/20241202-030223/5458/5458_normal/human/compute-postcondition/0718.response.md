Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned in the initial state, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 2, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and the new value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`**
