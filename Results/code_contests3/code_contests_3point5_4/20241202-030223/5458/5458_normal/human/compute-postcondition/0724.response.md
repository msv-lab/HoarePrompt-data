Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `j` is incremented by 2. The loop executes for `k` within the range of 1 to `s`. The value of `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. 
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the calculated value, `j` is incremented by 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions.**
