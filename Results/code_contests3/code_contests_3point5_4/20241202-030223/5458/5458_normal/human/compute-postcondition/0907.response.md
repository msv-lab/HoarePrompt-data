Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the function continues with the given conditions. Otherwise, the function terminates without making any changes.
