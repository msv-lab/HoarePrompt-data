Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1. The loop has executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`.***
