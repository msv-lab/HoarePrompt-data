Example Answer:
The value `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1, the updated value is stored in `dp[1][2][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1**
