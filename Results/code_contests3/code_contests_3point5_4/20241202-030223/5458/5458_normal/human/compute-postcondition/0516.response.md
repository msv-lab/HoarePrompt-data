Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the output state is as follows: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated to `dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
