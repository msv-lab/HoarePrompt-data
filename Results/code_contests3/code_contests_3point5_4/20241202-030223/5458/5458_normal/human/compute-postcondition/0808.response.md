Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the next time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, otherwise the program state remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` using the `mod` value.***
