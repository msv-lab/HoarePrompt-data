According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is updated, `n` is squared, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` must be incremented by 1. Additionally, if `k` becomes greater than `s`, the loop will not execute. 

State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
