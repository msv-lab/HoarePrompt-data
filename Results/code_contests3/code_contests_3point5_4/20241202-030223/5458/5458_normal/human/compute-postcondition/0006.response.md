Example Answer:
The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(2, m+2, s+1)`, where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000**
