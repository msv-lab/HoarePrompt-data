Postcondition: ***`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. If `i == 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
