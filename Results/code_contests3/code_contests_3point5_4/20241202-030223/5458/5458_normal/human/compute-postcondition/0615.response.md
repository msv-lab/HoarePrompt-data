Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `%` denotes the modulo operation. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. 
Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` and `j` should be greater than or equal to `k`. If `j > k`, the condition is met for the loop to execute one more time.**
