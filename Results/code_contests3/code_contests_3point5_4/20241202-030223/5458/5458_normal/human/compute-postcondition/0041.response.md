According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and all the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain positive integers. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m + 1`.
State: **Values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `mod` are positive integers, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1` for the loop to execute another time**
