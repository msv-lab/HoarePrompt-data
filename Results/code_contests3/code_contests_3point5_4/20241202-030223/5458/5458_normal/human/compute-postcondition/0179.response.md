Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is less than `m`. Additionally, after the if statement executes, `i` is equal to 0. When the if statement condition `(j >= k)` is true, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
