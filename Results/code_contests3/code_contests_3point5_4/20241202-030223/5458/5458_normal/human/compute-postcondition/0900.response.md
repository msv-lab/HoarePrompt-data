Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, and `k` is 1, the updated value is stored at `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1`**
