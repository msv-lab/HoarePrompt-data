Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j + 1`, and `k + 1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues its execution.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues its execution.**
