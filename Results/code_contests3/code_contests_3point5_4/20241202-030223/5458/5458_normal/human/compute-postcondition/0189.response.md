According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, and `j >= k` which implies `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. After the if statement, `i` is 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` remains the same, `k` is increased by 1.
