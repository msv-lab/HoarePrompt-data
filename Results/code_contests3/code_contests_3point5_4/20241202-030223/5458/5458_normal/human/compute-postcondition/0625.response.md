Postcondition: ***Final values of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers, and the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables and the program continues executing as normal.***
