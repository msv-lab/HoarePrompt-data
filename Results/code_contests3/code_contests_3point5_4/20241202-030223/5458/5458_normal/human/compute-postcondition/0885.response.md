Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`. If `i` is equal to 0, the values remain the same. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m` if `j` is greater than `k`.***
