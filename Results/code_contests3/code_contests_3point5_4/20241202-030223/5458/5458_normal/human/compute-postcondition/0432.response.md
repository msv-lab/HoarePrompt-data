Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are integers. At the beginning, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` are all 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` becomes 1, `j` increases by 1, and `dp` is updated with the new value of 1 at index `[1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged and the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated.***
