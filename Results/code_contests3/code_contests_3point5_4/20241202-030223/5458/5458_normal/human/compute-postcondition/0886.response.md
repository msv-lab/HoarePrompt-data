According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 2`, `s` is at least 1. 

So for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is equal to 0, the values remain the same.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is `k + 2`, `s` is at least 1. 
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Therefore, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop can execute again. 

State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is `k + 2`, `s` is at least 1**
