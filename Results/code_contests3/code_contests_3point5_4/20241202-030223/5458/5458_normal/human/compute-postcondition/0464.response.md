Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `k` is 1 and within the range 1 to `s` (inclusive) for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
