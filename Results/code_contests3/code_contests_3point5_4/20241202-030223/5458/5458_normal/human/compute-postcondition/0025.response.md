Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers. If `i` == 0, `j` is updated to 2, `k` is updated to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
