Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, the program continues without executing the else block. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
