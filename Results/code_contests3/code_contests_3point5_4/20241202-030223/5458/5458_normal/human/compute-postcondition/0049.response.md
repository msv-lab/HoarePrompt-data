Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the previous values of the affected variables are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: Values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, i is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **Values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, i is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
