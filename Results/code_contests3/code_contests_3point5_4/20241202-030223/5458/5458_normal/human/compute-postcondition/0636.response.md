Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, and the previous state of `dp` is not specified. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, the result of this assignment will depend on the previous state of `dp`, which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are 1, the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
