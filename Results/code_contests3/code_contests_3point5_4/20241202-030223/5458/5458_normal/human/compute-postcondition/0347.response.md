Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k+1` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `k` is updated to `k+1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `k+1` is updated based on the given assignments and calculations. In both cases, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated according to the conditions described for each scenario. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop or if statement. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by taking the modulus of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
