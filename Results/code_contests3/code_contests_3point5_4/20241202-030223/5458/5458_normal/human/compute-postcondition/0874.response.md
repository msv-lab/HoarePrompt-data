Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is `k+1`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program follows the same state as mentioned above. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
