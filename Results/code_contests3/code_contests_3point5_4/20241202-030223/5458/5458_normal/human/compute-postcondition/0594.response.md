Example Answer:
The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not defined in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. The state of other variables is also not impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is 1, m is 3, s is greater than or equal to 1, dp values are determined within the loop for each iteration, i is not defined, j is 3, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made.
Output State: **n is 1, m is 3, s is greater than or equal to 1, dp values are determined within the loop for each iteration, i is not defined, j is 3, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, i is not equal to 0, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been made**
