Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`**
