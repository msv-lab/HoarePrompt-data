Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. For the loop to execute the first time, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. `i` is not equal to 0. After the if condition, `j` is greater than `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues executing.***
