According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely since the condition is `while 1`, which is always true. Therefore, the loop will execute one more time regardless of the initial states provided.

State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000**
