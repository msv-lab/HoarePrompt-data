Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `m`, `i` is 0. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k + 1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, `j >= k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1.**
