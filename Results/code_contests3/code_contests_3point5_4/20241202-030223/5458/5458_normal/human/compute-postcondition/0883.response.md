Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m` if `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m+1`, `k` is `k+2`, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than `m` if `j` is greater than `k`**
