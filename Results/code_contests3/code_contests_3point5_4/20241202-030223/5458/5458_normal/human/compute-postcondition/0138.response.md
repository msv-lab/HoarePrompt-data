Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m` are positive integers. For the loop to execute the third time, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
