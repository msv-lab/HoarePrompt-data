According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` and `s` are not directly related to the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted. The 2D list `dp` being initialized with 0 in each cell does not affect the loop execution either.

So, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `s` have their assigned integer values, 2D list `dp` is created and initialized with 0 in each cell, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
