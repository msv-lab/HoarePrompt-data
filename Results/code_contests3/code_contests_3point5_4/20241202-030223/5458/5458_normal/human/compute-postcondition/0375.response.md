Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not defined in the initial state, the output state will be: All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
