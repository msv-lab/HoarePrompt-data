Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop executes one more time. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 2, `m` is equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to 2, `m` is equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
