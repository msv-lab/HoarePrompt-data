Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the initial state is not provided, it is not possible to determine the exact values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, if `j > k`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables.
