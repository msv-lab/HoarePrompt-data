Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the value stored in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **`dp[n]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above**
