According to the code, the loop executes for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. The loop has executed for the last time, so `j` has reached the value of `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be `m + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j` is `m + 1`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers**
