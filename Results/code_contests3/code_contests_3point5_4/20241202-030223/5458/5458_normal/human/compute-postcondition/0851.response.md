Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after executing the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
