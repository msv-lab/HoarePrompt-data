Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers, `k` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` > `k`, the program continues with the given variables unchanged.***
