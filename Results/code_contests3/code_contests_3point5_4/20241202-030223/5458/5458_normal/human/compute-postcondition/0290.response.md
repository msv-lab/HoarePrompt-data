According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain the same as their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
