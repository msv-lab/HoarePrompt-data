Example Answer:
The value of dp at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of dp at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, but based on the assignment, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, i, j, m, s, mod, k are positive integers. k is 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute s is greater than or equal to 1. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k.
Output State: **N, M, S, i, j, m, s, mod, k are positive integers. k is 1, j is 1, for the loop to execute s is greater than or equal to 1. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k**
