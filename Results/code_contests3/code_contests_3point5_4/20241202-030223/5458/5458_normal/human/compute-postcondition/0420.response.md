According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). To ensure the loop executes, the variables that need to be adjusted are `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, and `k`. Since `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be adjusted to 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive)**
