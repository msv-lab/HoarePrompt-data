According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `m`.
State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is `m+1`, `k` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` needs to be less than `m`**
