According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is in the range of 1 to 7, it satisfies this condition. However, the loop will execute for `n**2` times. So, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `M` and `S` are positive integers such that 1 <= M <= 2000 and 1 <= S <= 3000, for the loop to execute `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0**
