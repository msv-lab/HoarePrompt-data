Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2. When the if condition is satisfied, `i` is equal to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. When the else condition is satisfied, `i` is not equal to 0, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the formula mentioned. The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1.**
