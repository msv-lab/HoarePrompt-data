Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. If `i` is 0, all variables remain 0, `j` is 2, and `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s` (inclusive). Moreover, 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, then `n`, `m`, `s`, `i` remain 0, `j` remains 2, `k` remains within the range of 1 to `s`, and the values of `dp` are updated accordingly.***
