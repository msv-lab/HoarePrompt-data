According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `j` are increased by 1, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified within the loop. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than 0. If `i == 0`, then the value of `i` is 0. If `j >= k`, then the value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0 after the if condition is false, and `j > k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
State: **At the end of the if else block, `N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k`, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0.**
