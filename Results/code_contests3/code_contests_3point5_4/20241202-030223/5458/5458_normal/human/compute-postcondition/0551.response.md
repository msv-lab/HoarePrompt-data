Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop execution, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers with `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` equal to 1. The loop has executed at least once, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3. If `i == 0`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions specified. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged as per the conditions.***
