Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the execution of the if else block.***
