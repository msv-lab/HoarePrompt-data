Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. If `j` is greater than `k`, then all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues its execution. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated.**
