According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions given. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, the new value of `k` should be `s + 2`.

State: **`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions**.
