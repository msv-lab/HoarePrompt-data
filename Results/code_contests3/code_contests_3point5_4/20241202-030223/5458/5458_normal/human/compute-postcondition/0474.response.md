Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be within the range 1 to `s`, and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain consistent with the previous iteration. If `i` is equal to 0, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated accordingly.***
