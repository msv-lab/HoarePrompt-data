According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is at least 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 1 and `n` should be greater than 0.
State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 <= M <= 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 <= S <= 3000, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
