Postcondition: ***`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and after the execution of the if-else block, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise no change occurs. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as per the given expressions.***
