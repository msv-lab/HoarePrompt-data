Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. If `i` == 0 and `j` > `k`, `j` is updated to 2, `k` is updated to 1. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Otherwise, no variables are updated, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
