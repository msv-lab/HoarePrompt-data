Since the `while` loop condition is `while 1`, the loop will execute indefinitely until explicitly broken out of within the loop body. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, all the final integer values of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` should remain the same.
State: **Final values of variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers, and the value printed is the result of `dp[n]`**
