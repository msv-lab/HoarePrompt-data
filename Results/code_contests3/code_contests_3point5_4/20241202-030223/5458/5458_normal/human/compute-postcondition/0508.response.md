According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers, for the loop to execute another time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1**
