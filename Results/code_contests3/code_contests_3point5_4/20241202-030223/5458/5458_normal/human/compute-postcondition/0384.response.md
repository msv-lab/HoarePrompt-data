According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1` after the increment.
State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time**
