Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. If `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is updated to current_k + 1 for the next iteration. If `j > k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
