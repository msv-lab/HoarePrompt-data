Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k + 1` must be within the range 1 to `s`, and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` remain consistent with the previous iteration. If `j >= k`, the loop will execute one more time with `k + 1` within the range 1 to `s`. Otherwise, there will be no change in the loop execution. If `i == 0`, no changes are made. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.***
