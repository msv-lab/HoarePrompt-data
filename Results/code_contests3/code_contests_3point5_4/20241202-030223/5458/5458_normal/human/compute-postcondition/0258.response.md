Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the Output State is: `j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s + 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`j` is m, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is s + 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
