According to the code, the loop execution is dependent on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `m`. 
At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, thus `k` should be 3 for the next iteration. Additionally, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `s` do not seem to be directly related to the loop execution condition in this case.

State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value. `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are updated based on the loop conditions. `n` is squared for the last iteration. `m` is at least 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. `j` is 2 and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time.**
