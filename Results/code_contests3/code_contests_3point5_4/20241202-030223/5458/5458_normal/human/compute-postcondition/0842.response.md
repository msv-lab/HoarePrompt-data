Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, after the if condition `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the loop continues executing.**
