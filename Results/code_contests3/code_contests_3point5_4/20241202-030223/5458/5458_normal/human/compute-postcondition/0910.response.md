According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since `k` is iterated over from 1 to `s`, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The other states remain the same as there are no conditions affecting them at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time**.
