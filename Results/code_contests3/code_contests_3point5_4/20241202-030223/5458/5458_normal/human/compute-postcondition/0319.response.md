According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` being greater than 0 do not ensure the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. `dp` being a 2D list initialized with 0 does not affect the loop execution. `i` being 0 and `j` being 1 are not relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has an assigned integer value greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list created and initialized with 0 in each cell, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
