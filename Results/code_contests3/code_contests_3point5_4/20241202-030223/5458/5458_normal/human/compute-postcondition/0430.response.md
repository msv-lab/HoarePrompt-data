Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` remain unchanged. Since `j` is greater than `k` and the loop continues to execute the next iteration, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` remain unchanged, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i` remain unchanged, `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated**
