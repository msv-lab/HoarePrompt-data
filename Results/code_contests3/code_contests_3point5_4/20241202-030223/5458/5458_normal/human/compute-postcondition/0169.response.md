Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `mod`, `k` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the loop continues normally. `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
