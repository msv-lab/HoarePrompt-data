Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is incremented by 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.
