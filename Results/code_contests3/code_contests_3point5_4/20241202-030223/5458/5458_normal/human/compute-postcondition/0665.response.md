Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `All variables are integers where n > 0, m >= 1, s >= 1, the value printed is the result of dp[n]`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **All variables are integers where n > 0, m >= 1, s >= 1, the value printed is the result of dp[n], j is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k is within the range of 1 to s inclusive, i is 0, j is greater than or equal to k**
