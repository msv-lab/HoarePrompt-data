Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` are greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `k + 1` must be less than `s`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1. If `j >= k`, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.***
