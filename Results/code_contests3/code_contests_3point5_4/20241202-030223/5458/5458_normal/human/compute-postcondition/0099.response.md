Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified. If `j >= k + 1`, then `N`, `M`, `S` are increased by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is incremented by 1, `s`, `mod` remain the same, `dp` array is modified, for the loop to execute again `s` is greater than 0.***
