Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m + 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the same values. If `j > k`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
