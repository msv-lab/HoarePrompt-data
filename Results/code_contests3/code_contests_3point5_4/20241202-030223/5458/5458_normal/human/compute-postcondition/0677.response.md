Postcondition: ***All variables are integers where n > 0, m >= 1, s >= 1, the value printed is the result of dp[n], j is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute k+1 is within the range of 1 to s inclusive. If i is 0 and j is greater than or equal to k+1, the program continues to execute the loop. If i is not equal to 0, after the if else block executes, j is greater than k+1, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
