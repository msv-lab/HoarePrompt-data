Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This means that the value of `dp` at the new index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` are greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` is less than `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1.
Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` are greater than or equal to 1, `k + 1` is less than `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1**
