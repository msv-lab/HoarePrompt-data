Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions (2, m+2, s+1) and initialized with 0 in each cell. The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, and a 2D list `dp` is created and initialized with 0 in each cell.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, and a 2D list `dp` is created and initialized with 0 in each cell**
