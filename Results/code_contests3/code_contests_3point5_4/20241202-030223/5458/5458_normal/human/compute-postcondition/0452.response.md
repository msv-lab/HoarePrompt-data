According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers**.
