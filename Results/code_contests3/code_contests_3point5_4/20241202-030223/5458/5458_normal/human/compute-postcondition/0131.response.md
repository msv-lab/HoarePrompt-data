Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `mod`, `m`, `k` are positive integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
