According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of `1` to `s`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1`. Additionally, `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 1` and should be less than `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
