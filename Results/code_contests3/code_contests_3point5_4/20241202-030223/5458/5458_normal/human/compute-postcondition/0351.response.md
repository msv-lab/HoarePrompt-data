According to the code, the loop will execute `m` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be increased by 1, and the values of other variables remain the same.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same for the loop to execute one more time**
