Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the assignment.
Output State: **`j` is `m`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the assignment**
