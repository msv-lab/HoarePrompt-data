Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 2, and the value of `k` is incremented by 2 only if `j` is greater than `k`. Then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. 
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is incremented by 2 if `j` > `k**`.
