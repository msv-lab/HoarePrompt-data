Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, the values of `j`, `s`, and `k` remain the same as their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1. Additionally, when `i` is equal to 0, the program state is as follows: `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. When `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program state is such that `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `s` is at least 1.***
