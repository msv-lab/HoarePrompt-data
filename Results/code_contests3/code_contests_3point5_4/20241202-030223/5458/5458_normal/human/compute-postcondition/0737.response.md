Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp[n]` contains the final calculated value, `i` is updated based on the loop conditions, `n` is squared for the next iteration, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
