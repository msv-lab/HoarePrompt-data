Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The initial states of the variables are given: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `mod` is a positive integer. Since no other variables are affected, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `mod` is a positive integer**
