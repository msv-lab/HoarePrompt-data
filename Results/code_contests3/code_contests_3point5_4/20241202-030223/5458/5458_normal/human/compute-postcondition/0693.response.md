Output State: **All variables are integers where `n` > 0, `m` >= 1, `s` >= 1. The value printed is the result of `dp[n]`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` will be such that the conditions in the if statements will determine the values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be based on the previous values of `dp`.**
