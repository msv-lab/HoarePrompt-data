Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints provided in the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the possible combinations of numbers that can be used in the Bingo card. The program handles different inputs for N, M, and S and outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000. The code also correctly terminates when the input is 0 0 0. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and produces the correct output.
