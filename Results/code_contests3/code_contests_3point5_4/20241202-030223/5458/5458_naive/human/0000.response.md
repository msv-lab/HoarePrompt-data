Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given constraints. It correctly handles different values of N, M, and S by iterating through all possible combinations and updating the dynamic programming table accordingly. The program correctly calculates the result by taking the remainder of the final value divided by 100000. Since the program covers all potential cases and produces correct output for each, it can be considered correct.
