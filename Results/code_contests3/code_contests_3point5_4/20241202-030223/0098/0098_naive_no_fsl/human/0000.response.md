Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in based on the given formula.
2. The program then reads the number of test cases `T`, iterates over each test case, reads the value of `n`, and calculates the minimum length of the square side using the `func_1` function.
3. The program prints the result with 9 decimal places as required.
4. Since the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for each test case, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
