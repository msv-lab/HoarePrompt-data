Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases. The function func_1(n) is called twice for each test case, which is unnecessary. This means that the output will be repeated for each test case. Additionally, the code does not calculate the square of the minimum size to embed a 2n-gon in a square as specified in the problem description. The calculations in func_1(n) are not related to finding the minimum length of a side of the square. Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
