Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in for each test case. The formula used in the program is derived from the geometry of regular polygons and squares, and the math operations are correct. The program also prints the result with the required precision. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, we can conclude that it is correct.
