Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` which takes an odd integer `n` as input and calculates the result of a specific mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions. This result corresponds to the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded, as required by the problem description. The formula used in the program is correct and produces the expected output for each test case within the given constraints.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and can be considered correct.
