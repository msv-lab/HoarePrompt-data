The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The program returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions with respect to the odd integer 'n'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions.
