Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that returns the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded. The formula used in the program `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` is derived from the problem description and correctly calculates the required value based on the given odd integer n.

Since the program correctly implements the formula provided in the problem description for all odd integers n within the specified range, it meets the requirements and is correct.
