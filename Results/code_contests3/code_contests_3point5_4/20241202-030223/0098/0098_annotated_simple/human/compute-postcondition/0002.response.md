Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer n within the range 3 to 199 and calculates the result of the mathematical expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)). **

Note: The annotation specifies that n is an odd integer within a certain range, but it does not mention that the math module needs to be imported for the code to function correctly. This import statement is missing from the annotated code.
