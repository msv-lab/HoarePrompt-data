Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.**
