Example Answer:
The list `c` is initialized with 101 elements, all having the value 0. This initialization does not affect the values of other variables. Since the value of `n` is not 11, no changes occur in the program state.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and the list `c` is initialized with 101 elements all having the value 0.**
