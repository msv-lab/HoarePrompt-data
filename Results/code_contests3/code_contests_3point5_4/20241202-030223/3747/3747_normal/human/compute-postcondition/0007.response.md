Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in the list `c` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `c` has all elements as 0, so after execution, the value at index `d` in the list `c` will be 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list `a` contains at least one integer, the list `c` has elements with one of them being 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the list `a` contains at least one integer, the list `c` has elements with one of them being 1**
