Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Then, it creates a new list `c` to count the occurrences of each unique element in list `a`. Finally, it prints the maximum count in list `c`. The function does not return any specific output based on the given constraints.**
