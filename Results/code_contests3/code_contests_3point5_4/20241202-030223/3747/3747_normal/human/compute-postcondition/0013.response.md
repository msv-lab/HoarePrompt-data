Example Answer:
The code prints the maximum value in the list `c`, which contains the count of occurrences of each unique element in list `a`. Since `c` contains the count of occurrences, the maximum value in `c` represents the highest count of any unique element in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: Maximum count of occurrences in list `a`.
Output State: **Maximum count of occurrences in list `a`**
