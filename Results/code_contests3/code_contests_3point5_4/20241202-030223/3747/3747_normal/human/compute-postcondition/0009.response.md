Example Answer: 
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` has an element that is 1, after execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` will be 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, list `a` still has elements left to iterate over, and the list `c` has elements with one of them being 2.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, list `a` still has elements left to iterate over, and the list `c` has elements with one of them being 2**
