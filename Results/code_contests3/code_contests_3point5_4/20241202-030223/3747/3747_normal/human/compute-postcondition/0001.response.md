Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the result of mapping the input of space-separated integers into a list of integers. The values of the integers in the list `a` are not known beforehand, but each integer in the list will be between 1 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100**
