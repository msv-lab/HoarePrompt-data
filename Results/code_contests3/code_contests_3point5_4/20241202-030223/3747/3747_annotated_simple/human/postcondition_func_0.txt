The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a list `a` containing integers representing the values of the coins. If `n` is equal to 11, the function prints 5. Then, it creates a dictionary `c` where keys are the values of the coins and the values are the count of each coin. Finally, it prints the maximum value in the dictionary `c`.
