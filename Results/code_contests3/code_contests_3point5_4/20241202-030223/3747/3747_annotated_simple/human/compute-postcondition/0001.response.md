Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the integer values obtained by mapping `int` over the input values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `a_i` are stored in the list `a`. The values of `n` and individual `a_i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins**
