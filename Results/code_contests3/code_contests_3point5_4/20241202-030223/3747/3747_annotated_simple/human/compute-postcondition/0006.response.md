According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer representing the number of coins, does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is a list with at least 1 element, and `d` is the first element in the list.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute the first time a is a list with at least 1 element, d is the first element in the list**
