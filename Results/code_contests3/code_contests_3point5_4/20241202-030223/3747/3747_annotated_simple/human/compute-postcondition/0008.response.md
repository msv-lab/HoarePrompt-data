According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, `d` is the first element in the list, and `c[d]` has been incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the next element after `d` will be used as `d`.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute a second time a is a list with at least 2 elements, d is the next element after the current `d` in the list, c[d] is incremented by 1**
