Example Answer: 
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c[d]` is not specified, but it is known that `c` is a list and `d` is an index in that list. After executing the code, the value of `c[d]` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute a second time `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `d` is the next element after the current `d` in the list, `c[d]` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute a second time `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `d` is the next element after the current `d` in the list, `c[d]` is incremented by 1**
