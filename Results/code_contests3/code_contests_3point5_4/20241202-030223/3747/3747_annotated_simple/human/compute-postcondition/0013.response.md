Example Answer:
The `max()` function is used to find the maximum key in the dictionary `c`, which represents the highest value of a coin. The output will be the highest value of a coin present in the dictionary `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a is a list of integers representing the values of the coins, c is a dictionary where the keys are the values of the coins and the values are the count of each coin. The highest value of a coin is printed.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a is a list of integers representing the values of the coins, c is a dictionary where the keys are the values of the coins and the values are the count of each coin. The highest value of a coin is printed.**
