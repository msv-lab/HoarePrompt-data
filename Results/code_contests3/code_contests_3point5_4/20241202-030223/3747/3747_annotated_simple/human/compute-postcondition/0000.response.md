Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The value of `n` represents the number of coins. The value of `n` can be any integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, and a_i are integers representing the values of the coins. Each a_i is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, and a_i are integers representing the values of the coins. Each a_i is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.**
