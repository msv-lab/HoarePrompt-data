Example Answer:
A list `c` is created with 101 elements, all initialized to 0. This list seems to be used for some sort of calculations or storage, but it does not affect the initial state variables `n` and `a_i`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins. 
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins.**
