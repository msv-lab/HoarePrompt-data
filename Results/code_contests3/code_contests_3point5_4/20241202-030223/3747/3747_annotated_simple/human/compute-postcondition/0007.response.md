Example Answer:
The code increments the value at index `d` in list `c` by 1. The value of `d` is the first element in list `a`, and `a` has at least 1 element. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute the first time a is a list with at least 1 element, d is the first element in the list, c[d] is incremented by 1.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, for the loop to execute the first time a is a list with at least 1 element, d is the first element in the list, c[d] is incremented by 1**
