Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program does not actually distribute the coins between Polycarp's pockets in such a way that no two coins with the same value are in the same pocket. Instead, it just calculates the maximum frequency of a coin value in the input list `a` and prints it. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
