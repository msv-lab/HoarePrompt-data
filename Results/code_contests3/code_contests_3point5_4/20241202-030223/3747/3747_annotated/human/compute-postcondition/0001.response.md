Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input values separated by spaces provided by `raw_input().split()`. Since `n` is an input integer, `a` will be a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
