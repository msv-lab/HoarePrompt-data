Example Answer:
The value of `d` is updated to the second element in the list `a`. Then, the value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The states of `n` and `a` remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is updated to the second element in the list `a`**
