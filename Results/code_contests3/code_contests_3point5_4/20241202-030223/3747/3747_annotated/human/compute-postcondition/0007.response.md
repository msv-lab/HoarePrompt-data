Example Answer:
The value of `d` is the first element in the list `a`, so `d` is updated to that value. Then, the element at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is updated to the first element in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with one element incremented, `d` is updated to the first element in the list `a`**
