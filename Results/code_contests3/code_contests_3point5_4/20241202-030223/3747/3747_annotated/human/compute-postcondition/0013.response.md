Example Answer:
The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the list `c`, which represents the frequency of each index in list `a`. Since `c` has 101 elements, the maximum frequency value in `c` is printed. The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with each element representing the frequency of that index in list `a`, `d` is the last element in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with each element representing the frequency of that index in list `a`, `d` is the last element in the list `a`**
