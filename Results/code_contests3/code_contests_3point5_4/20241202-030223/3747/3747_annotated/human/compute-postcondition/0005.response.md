Example Answer:
The list `c` is created with 101 elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected, and there are no print statements or conditionals in the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0**
