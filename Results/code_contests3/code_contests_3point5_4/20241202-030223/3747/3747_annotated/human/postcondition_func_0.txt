The function `func()` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers `a`. If `n` is equal to 11, the function prints the integer 5. Then, the function creates a list `c` of size 101 and updates the frequency of each element from list `a` in `c`. Finally, the function prints the maximum value in list `c`. The functionality of the function is to process the input values and determine the maximum frequency of elements in the input list `a`.
