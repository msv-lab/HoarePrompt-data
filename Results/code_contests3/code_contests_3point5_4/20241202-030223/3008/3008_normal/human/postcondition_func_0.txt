The function prompts the user to input a value for `n`, then checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0. If the condition is met, it updates the variable `s` to 1. Finally, it calculates and prints the result of the expression 2 * (n / 10) + s. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It does not cover the case where the user enters a non-integer value or handles potential errors related to input validation.
