Example Answer:
If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not equal to 0, `s` is updated to 1. Then, the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is evaluated. The output will depend on the input value of `n` and whether `s` is updated to 1 based on the condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the user input value, `s` is either 0 or 1, and the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`.
Output State: **`n` is the user input value, `s` is either 0 or 1, the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`**
