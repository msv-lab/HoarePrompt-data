Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero by subtracting a digit from it each time. However, the given code does not implement this logic correctly.

For example, if we input 24, the expected output should be 5 as per the problem description:
24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0

But the code provided does not produce the correct output. The code simply checks if the last digit of the input number is not zero and then performs a calculation to find the minimum number of subtractions. This does not align with the actual requirements of the problem description, where we need to continuously subtract a digit from the number until it reaches zero. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
