Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The logic used in the program is flawed and may not work for all cases. For example, if the input is 24, the expected output should be 5 (24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0). However, the program will not produce the correct output for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
