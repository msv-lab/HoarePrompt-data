Example Answer:
If the last digit of n is not 0, s is updated to 1. Otherwise, s remains 0. Then the expression is evaluated by multiplying n by 2 and dividing the result by 10, then adding s. Finally, the result is printed. 
Output State: **Depends on the input value of n and whether the last digit is 0 or not.**
