The function `func` prompts the user for input, calculates `s` based on whether the last digit of the input `n` is not 0, and then prints the result of the mathematical expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. The code does not explicitly specify the type of `n` after the input, so there could be issues with division if the input is not an integer. Additionally, the function does not return any value.
