Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input magic number `n`, checking if it is divisible by 10, and then calculating the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. The logic used in the program aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description. The program works as expected for all potential cases within the given constraints.
