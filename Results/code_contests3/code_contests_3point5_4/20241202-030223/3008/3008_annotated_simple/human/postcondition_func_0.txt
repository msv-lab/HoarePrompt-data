The function reads an input integer n, checks if n is not divisible by 10 and sets s to 1 in that case, otherwise s remains 0. It then prints the result of the expression 2 * (n / 10) + s. The function doesn't accept any parameters and doesn't have a specified output. There is a potential issue with the division operation as the input n is taken as a string and not converted to an integer. This can lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to perform arithmetic operations.
