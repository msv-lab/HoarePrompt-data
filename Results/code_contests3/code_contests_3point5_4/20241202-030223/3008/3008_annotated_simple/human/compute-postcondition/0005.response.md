Example Answer:
The expression inside the print statement calculates 2 times the result of (n divided by 10) plus the value of s. The value of s depends on whether n % 10 is not equal to 0. If n % 10 is not equal to 0, s is 1; otherwise, s remains 0. Therefore, the final output depends on the value of n and whether n % 10 is equal to 0.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of n and whether n % 10 is equal to 0**
