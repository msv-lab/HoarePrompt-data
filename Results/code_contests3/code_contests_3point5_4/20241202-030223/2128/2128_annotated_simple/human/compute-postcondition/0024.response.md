According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `l` is now 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is 1**
