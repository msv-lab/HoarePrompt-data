Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is the sum of the largest element and the k-th largest element in the array `arr`, the output will be the sum of these two elements. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain the same as they are not affected by the print statement.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the largest element and the k-th largest element in the array, and the value of `ans` is printed**
