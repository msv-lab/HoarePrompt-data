Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `n` is assigned a value from the input, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
