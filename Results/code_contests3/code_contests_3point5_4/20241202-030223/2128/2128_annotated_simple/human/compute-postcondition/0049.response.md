Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the standard input, processes the data according to the given algorithm, and prints the result. It reads an integer `t`, then for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. It sorts `arr` in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `n` elements in `arr`, adjusts `k` if it exceeds `n - 1`, sums up to the first `k + 1` elements in the sorted array, and prints the final sum `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**

Note: The annotations state that the function does not accept parameters or return any value, but it actually reads from the standard input and prints output.
