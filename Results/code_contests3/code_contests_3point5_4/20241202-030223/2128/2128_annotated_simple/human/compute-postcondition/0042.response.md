Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `l` is not explicitly provided, so the updated `ans` depends on the specific index `l` in the list `arr`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned a value, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned a value, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute a second time**
