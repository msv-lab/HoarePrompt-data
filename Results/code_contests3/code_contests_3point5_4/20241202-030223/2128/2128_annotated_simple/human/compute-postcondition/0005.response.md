Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is assigned as the first element of the sorted array `arr`, which is in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will be the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array**
