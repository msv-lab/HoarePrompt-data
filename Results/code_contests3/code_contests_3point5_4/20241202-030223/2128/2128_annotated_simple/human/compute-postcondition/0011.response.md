According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, `l` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, `l` is 2**
