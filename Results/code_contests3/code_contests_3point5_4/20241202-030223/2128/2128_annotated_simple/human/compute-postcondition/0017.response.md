According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the largest element and the k-th largest element in the array, and the value of `ans` is printed, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be incremented by 1**
