According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is the sum of the largest element in the array and the elements at indices 1 to `k` of the array, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain the same.
State: **`ans` is the sum of the largest element in the array and the elements at indices 1 to `k` of the array, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
