According to the code, the loop executes based on the variables `l` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element plus the 3rd largest element, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element plus the 3rd largest element, `l` is 3**
