Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of the array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and `l` is 1, the largest element in the array is added to `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, `l` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array, `l` is 1**
