Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of the array `arr`, where `l` is 3. The variable `l` is assigned 3, and `arr` is sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` is increased by the value at index 3 of the array `arr`. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`ans` is increased by the value at index 3 of the array `arr`**
