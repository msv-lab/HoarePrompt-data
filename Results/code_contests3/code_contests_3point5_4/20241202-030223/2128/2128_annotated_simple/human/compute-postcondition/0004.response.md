Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The order of the list `arr` is changed based on the values it had before sorting. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
