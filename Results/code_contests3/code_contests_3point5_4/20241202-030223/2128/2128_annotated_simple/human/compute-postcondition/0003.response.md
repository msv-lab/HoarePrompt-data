Example Answer: 
The code takes input from the standard input, splits it by spaces, converts the elements to integers, and stores them in a list named `arr`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input**
