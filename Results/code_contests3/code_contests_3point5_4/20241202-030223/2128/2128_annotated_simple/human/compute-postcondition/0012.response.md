Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, the value at index `l` is the 3rd largest element in the array. Therefore, `ans` is increased by the 3rd largest element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `l` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the array plus the 3rd largest element, `l` is 2**
