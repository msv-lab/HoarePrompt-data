Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value at the 3rd index of the sorted `arr`. As `arr` is sorted in descending order, the 3rd largest element is at index 2. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by the value at index 2 of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the largest and 3rd largest element, `l` is 3**.
