Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, and `n` is a positive integer from the input. Therefore, after execution, `k` will have a value of 1 less than the input `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the largest element in the array, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned a value from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1 less than `n`.
Output State: **`ans` is the largest element in the array, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is assigned a value from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1 less than `n`**
