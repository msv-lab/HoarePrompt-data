Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`. The values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the input provided during execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input**
