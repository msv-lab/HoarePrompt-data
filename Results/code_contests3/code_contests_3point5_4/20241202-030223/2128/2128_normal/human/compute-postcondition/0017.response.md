According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `t` where `t` is the number of test cases. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` have their respective values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the sorted `arr`.**
