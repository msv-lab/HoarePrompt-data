Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, which is the largest element as `arr` is sorted in descending order. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will hold the largest element in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1` for the loop to execute the final time. `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
