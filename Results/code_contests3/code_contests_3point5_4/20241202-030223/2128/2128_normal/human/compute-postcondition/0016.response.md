Example Answer:
The Python code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `n` elements of the sorted `arr`. The initial state mentions that `arr` is sorted in descending order, so the sum of the first `n` elements would be the value of `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` have their respective values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the sorted `arr`.**
