Example Answer:
Printing the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`. The initial state provides that `ans` is already calculated and represents the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1`.
Output State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `k` elements in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1`**
