For the loop to execute, the value of `l` needs to be within the range of `1` to `k + 1`. This means that `l` should start from `1` and go up to `k`. Since `k` is less than `n` and `l` is equal to `k + 1` for the loop to execute the final time, the state needs to be adjusted so that `l` starts at `1` and increments up to `k`.

State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` starts at `1` and goes up to `k` for the loop to execute**.
