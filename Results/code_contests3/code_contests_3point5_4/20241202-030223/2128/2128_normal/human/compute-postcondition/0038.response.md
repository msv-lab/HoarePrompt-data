Postcondition: ***`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1` for the loop to execute the final time. `arr` is sorted in descending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1` for the loop to execute the final time. `arr` is sorted in descending order.***
