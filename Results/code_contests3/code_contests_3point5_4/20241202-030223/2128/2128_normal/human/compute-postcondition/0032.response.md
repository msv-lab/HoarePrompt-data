According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i`, `t`, and `l`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `arr` except the last one, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `l` should be increased by 1 to reach the final value of `k`.
State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `arr` except the last one, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is equal to `k+1` for the loop to execute the final time**
