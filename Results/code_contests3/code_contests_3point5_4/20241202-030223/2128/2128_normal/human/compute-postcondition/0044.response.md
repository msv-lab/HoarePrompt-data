Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 3. The value of `arr[l]` is the element at index 3 in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, the element at index 3 is the 4th largest element. Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the 4th largest element in `arr`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include the 4th largest element in `arr`, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is 3**
