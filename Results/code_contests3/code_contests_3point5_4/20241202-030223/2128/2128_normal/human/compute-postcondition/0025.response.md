The value of `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of the sorted `arr`. Since `l` is initially 1, the value at index 1 of the sorted `arr` is added to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t`, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of sorted `arr` and the element at index 1, `ans` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
