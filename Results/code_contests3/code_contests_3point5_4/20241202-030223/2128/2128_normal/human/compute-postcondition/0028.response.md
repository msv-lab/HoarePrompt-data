According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, `k` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, so `l` becomes 2. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`t`, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of sorted `arr` and the element at index 1 plus the value at index 2 of `arr`, `ans` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
