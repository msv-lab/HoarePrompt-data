According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `t` being an input integer representing the number of test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
