Postcondition: ***`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` are integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `t` is the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` have their respective values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the first element of the sorted `arr`, `ans` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, and `k` is equal to `n - 1`.***
