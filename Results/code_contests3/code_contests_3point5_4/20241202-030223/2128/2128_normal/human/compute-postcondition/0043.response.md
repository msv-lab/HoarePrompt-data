According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `k`, and the length of the list `arr`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, `k` is less than `n`, and `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. Since `l` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, the next value of `l` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be less than or equal to `k+1`.
State: **`t`, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include the sum of the next `k` elements in `arr` starting from index 3, `k` is less than `n`, `l` is 3**
