Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list in descending order, calculates the sum of the first `k` elements, and prints the result. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to be `n - 1`. The function executes this process for all `t` test cases.**
