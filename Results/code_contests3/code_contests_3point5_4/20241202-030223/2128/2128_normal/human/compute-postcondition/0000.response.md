Example Answer: 
`t` is assigned the value of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads an integer input from the standard input. The value of `t` represents the number of test cases. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases**
