Output State: `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the first element of the sorted array. If `k >= n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `l` starts from 1 and goes up to `k`. `ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` of the sorted array `arr` to it.
