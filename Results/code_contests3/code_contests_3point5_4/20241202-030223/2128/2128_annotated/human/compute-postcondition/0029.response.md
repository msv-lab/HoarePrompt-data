Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, and this value is added to the current value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` are updated based on the input, `i` is increased by 1, `arr` is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, if `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1, for the loop to execute the third time `l` is incremented by 1 and `l` is still less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is further increased by the value of `arr[l]`.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` are updated based on the input, `i` is increased by 1, `arr` is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, if `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1, for the loop to execute the third time `l` is incremented by 1 and `l` is still less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is further increased by the value of `arr[l]`.**
