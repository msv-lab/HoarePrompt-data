Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `i` are assigned values based on the input. `arr` is sorted in descending order. `ans` is increased by the sum of the elements from index 1 to `k` in `arr`. `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`. If `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.***
