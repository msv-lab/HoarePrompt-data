Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is already calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state with the addition of the printed value of `ans`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by the sum of the elements from index 1 to `k` in `arr`, the value of `ans` is printed.**
