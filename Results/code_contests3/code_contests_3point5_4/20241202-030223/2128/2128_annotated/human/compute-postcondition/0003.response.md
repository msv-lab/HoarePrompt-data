Example Answer:
The list `arr` is created by mapping the input values to integers using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`. The values of `arr` will depend on the input provided. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input**
