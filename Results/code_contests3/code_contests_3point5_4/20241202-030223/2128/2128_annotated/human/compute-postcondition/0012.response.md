Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `l` should be less than `k` and `k` should be greater than 1**
