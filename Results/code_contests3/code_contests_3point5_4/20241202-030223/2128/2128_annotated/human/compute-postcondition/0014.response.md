Example Answer: 
`ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`. The loop executes a third time, so `l` is increased by 1. The condition `l` should be less than `k` and `k` should be greater than 1 is checked. Since `l` was initially 0 and `k` has been adjusted to be `n - 1` in a previous step, the loop will execute for the third time. Therefore, `ans` is further increased by the value at index `l` of `arr`. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of `arr` for the third time**
