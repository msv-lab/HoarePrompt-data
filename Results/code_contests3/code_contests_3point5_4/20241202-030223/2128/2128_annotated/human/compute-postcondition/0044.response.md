Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the first element of the sorted array, if `k >= n`, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` starts from 1 and goes up to `k`, `l` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding the value at index 2 of the sorted array `arr` to it**
