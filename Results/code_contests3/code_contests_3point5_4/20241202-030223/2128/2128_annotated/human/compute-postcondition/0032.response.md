According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times, and it depends on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain unchanged, `arr` is still sorted in descending order, and `ans` is printed out. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
