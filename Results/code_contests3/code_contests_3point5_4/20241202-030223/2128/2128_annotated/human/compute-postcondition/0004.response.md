Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
