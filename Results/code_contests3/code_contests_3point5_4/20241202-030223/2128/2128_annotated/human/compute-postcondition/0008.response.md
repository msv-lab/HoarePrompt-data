Postcondition: ***`t`, `n`, `k` are non-negative integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` is greater than 0. `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input. `arr` is sorted in descending order. `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.***
