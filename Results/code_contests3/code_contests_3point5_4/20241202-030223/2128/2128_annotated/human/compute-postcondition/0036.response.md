Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is assigned the first element of the sorted array `arr` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input split by space. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the first element of the sorted array.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the first element of the sorted array**
