Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input obtained from the standard input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`. The values of `n` and `k` are dependent on the input provided, so the specific values cannot be determined without knowing the input. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time t is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **t is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute the first time t is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input**
