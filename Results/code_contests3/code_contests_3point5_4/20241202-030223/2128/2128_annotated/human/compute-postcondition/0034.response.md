Example Answer:
The `arr` variable is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by space from `sys.stdin.readline()`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input split by space. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space.
Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space**
