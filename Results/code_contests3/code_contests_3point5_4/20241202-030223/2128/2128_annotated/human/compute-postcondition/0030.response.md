Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `i` are updated based on the input, `arr` is still sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of elements from index 1 to `k` in `arr` after all iterations, `i` is equal to `t`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `t`, if `k >= n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`.**
