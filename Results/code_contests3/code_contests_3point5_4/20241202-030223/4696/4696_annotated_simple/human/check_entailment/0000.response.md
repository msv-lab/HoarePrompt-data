Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). It calculates the factorial of (n-k) and then uses this to determine the next element in the permutation based on the value of i. The program removes the selected element from the list of possible elements to ensure that each element is used only once in the permutation. The final output is the correct permutation as required by the problem description. The program ensures that the output is lexicographically the m-th permutation.
