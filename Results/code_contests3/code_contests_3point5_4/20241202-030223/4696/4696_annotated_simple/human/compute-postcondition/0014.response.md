Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated as `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2). The value of `d` depends on the values of `i` and `n`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2).
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2)**
