According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. 
For the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be incremented by 1, `i` should be updated based on the new value of `b`, `p` should be updated with the value at index `d` removed, `f` should be recalculated based on the new value of `n`, and `i` should be recalculated based on the updated values.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, f is the factorial of (n - 1), i is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`**
