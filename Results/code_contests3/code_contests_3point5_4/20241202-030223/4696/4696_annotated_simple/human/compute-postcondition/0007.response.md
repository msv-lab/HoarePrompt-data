Example Answer:
The value of `i` is divided by the factorial of (n - 1) and assigned to `d`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, and `f` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1), and d is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1), and d is the result of `i // f**.
