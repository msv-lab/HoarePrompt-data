Example Answer:
The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i % f`, where `f` is the factorial of `(n - 1)`. The value of `f` is calculated based on the previous value of `n`. The value of `i` is calculated based on the previous value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1), i is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1), i is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`**
