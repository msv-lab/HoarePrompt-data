Example Answer:
The value at index `d` of list `p` is being removed from the list. The previous states of the variables are as follows: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1). After executing the code, the output state will be: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1)**
