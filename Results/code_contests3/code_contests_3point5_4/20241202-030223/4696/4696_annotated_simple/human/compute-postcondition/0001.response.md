Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value obtained from converting the string `a` to an integer. The values of `m`, `cntn`, `f(p)`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string.
Output State: **n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string**
