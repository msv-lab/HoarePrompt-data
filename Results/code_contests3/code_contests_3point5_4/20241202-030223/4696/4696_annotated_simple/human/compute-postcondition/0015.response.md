Example Answer: 
`p.remove(p[d])` removes the element at index `d` from list `p`. The value of `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2). The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2), and the element at index `d` is removed from list `p`.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2), and the element at index `d` is removed from list `p`**
