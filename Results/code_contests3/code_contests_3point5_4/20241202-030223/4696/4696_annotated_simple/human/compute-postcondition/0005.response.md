According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
