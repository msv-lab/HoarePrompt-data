Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f` using integer division. The previous values of `i`, `f`, and `n` are unknown, so the exact value of `d` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`**
