Example Answer:
The value of `f` is assigned the result of the factorial of (n - k). The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are unknown, so the output state is: `d` is assigned the new value based on updated `i` and `n`, `i` is updated to the remainder of the updated `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be the next value after the last iteration, `f` is assigned the result of the factorial of (n - k).
Output State: **`d` is assigned the new value based on updated `i` and `n`, `i` is updated to the remainder of the updated `i` divided by `f`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` needs to be the next value after the last iteration, `f` is assigned the result of the factorial of (n - k)**
