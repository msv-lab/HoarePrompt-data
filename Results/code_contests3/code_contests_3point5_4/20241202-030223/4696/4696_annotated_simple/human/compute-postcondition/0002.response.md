Example Answer:
The value of `b` is converted to an integer and assigned to `i`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b`**
