Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned a range starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). The values of `a`, `m`, `cntn`, `b`, and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n**
