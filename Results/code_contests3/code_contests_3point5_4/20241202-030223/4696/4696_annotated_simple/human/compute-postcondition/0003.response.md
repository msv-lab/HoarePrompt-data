Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the new value of `i` will be one less than the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer obtained from `a`, m and cntn are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1**
