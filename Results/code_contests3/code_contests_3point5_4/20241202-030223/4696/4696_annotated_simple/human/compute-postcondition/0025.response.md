Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input, calculates the number of permutations of length `n`, and determines the maximum possible value of `f(p)`. It then performs a series of operations based on these values to manipulate a list `p`. The code does not explicitly return any value. **
