Example Answer: 
The value of `f` is assigned the factorial of `n - k`. Since `k` is initialized as 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers up to a given number, the value of `f` will be the factorial of `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, f is the factorial of (n - 1)**
