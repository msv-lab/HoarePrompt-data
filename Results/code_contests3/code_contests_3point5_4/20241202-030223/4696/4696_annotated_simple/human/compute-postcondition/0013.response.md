Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by `f`. The value of `i` is already decremented by 1, and `f` is the factorial of (n - 2). Therefore, the value of `d` will depend on the value of `i` and the factorial of (n - 2). Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `i` divided by the factorial of (n - 2)**
