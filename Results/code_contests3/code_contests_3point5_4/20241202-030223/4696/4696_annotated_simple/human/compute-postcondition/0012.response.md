Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value of the factorial of (n - k). The value of `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, so `n - k` is also a positive integer. Therefore, the value of `f` is the factorial of a positive integer. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer with 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, cntn is a positive integer, a and b are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input string, i is an integer value of `b` decremented by 1, p is a range from 1 to n with the value at index `d` removed, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, f is the factorial of (n - 2), i is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`**
