Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program calculates the factorial of (n-k) and then uses it to find the index to select the next element in the permutation. The program iterates through each element in the permutation and selects the element based on the calculated index. The selected element is then removed from the list of available elements to avoid repetition. This process continues until all elements are selected, resulting in the lexicographically m-th permutation with the maximum possible value of f(p). The program handles the given constraints and provides the correct output for the provided problem description.

Therefore, the code is correct in all cases and follows the problem description accurately.
