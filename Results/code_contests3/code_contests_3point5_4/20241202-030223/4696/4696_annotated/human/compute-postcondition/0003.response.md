Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but since it is being decremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`**
