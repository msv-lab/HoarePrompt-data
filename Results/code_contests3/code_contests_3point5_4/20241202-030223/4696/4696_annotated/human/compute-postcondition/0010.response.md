Example Answer:
The value of `i` is modified to be the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are known, so the new value of `i` can be calculated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of the remainder of the previous value of `b - 1` divided by the factorial of (n - 1), `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of `i // f`**
