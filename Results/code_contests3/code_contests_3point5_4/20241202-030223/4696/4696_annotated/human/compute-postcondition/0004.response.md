Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a range starting from 1 up to `n + 1`. Since `n` is an integer, the range will be from 1 to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n**
