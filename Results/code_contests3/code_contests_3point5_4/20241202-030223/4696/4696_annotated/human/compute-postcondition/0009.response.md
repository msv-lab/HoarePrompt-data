Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in the list `p` is removed. Initially, `p` contains numbers from 1 to n, and `d` is the result of `i // f`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of `i // f`**
