Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`. The value of `b` is unknown from the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b`**
