According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is less than or equal to n. At the end of the last iteration, k is equal to n. So for the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be incremented by 1, which means k should be n + 1.
State: **n is greater than or equal to 1, m and cntn are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, a and b are the values returned by splitting the input, i is an integer value of the remainder of the previous value of b - 1 divided by the factorial of (n - 1), p is a range from 1 to n excluding the value at index d, k is n + 1, f is the factorial of (n - 1), d is the result of i // f, and f is the factorial of (n - k), the value at index d of the range p is printed, for the loop to execute one more time k is n + 1**
