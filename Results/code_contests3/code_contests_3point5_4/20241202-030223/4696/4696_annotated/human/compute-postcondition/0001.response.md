Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is split into two integers `a` and `b`. The value of `n` is now the integer representation of `a`. The values of `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input**
