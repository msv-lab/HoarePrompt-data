Example Answer:
`f` is assigned the value of the factorial of `n - k`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the value of `k` is 1. Therefore, `n - k` can be equal to 0 or a positive integer. The factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any positive integer is calculated accordingly. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1).
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1)**
