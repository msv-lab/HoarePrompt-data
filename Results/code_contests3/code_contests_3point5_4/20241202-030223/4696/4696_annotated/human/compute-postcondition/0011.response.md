According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to the value of `n`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of the remainder of the previous value of `b - 1` divided by the factorial of (n - 1), `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the value at index `d`, `k` is n + 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of `i // f`**
