Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()` function, which splits the input based on whitespaces. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the values of `a` and `b`, the output state will be: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are the values returned by splitting the input.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are the values returned by splitting the input**
