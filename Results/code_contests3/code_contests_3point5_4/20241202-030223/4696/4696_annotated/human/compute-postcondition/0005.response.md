According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, since `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, the initial state should have `k` set to 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `cntn` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` and `b` are the values returned by splitting the input, `i` is an integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
