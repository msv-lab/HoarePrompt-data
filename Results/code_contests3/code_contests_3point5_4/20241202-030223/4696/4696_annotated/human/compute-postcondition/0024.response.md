The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It calculates the number of permutations of length n with a maximum possible value of f(p), where f(p) is a function defined within the function. The function returns the value of f(p) when applied to the permutation with the maximum possible value. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the number of permutations of length n with a maximum possible value of f(p) and return the value of f(p) for the permutation with the maximum possible value.
