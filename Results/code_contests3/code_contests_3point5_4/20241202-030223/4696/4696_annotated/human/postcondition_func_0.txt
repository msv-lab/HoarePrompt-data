The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and performs calculations on permutations of length `n`. It then prints the values based on those calculations. The code removes the need for the parameter `m` mentioned in the annotations and does not return any value as indicated. The functionality is to manipulate permutations and print specific values based on the calculations without considering the `m` parameter or returning any value.
