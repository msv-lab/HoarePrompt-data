Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly takes two integers n and m as input.
- It then calculates the maximum possible value of f(p) by finding the number of permutations of length n.
- The code then iterates through the permutations and prints the m-th lexicographically permutation with the maximum possible value of f(p).
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly outputs the required permutation.
