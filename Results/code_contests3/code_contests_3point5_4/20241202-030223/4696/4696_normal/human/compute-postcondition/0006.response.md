Example Answer:
The value of `f` is assigned the factorial of `n - k`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are known. If `n` is 5, `k` is 1, then `n - k` is 4. The factorial of 4 is 24. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n+1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is 24.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n+1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `f` is 24**
