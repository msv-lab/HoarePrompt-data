Functionality: **The function takes input for two positive integers n and m, where m is between 1 and the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). It then performs a series of calculations to find a positive integer m based on the constraints provided. The function calculates the number of permutations of length n and finds the maximum possible value of f(p).**
