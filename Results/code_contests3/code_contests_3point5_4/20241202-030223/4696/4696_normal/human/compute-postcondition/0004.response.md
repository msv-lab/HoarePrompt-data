Example Answer: 
`p` is assigned the range from 1 to n+1, where n is an integer based on the input `a`. The value of `i` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n+1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n+1**
