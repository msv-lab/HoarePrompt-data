Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, but the initial value of `b` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b`**
