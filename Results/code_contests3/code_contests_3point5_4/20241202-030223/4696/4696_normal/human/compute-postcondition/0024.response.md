The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally calculates the number of permutations of length n (cntn) and finds the maximum possible value of f(p) where p is a permutation. The function then returns the positive integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn. The constraints ensure that m is within a valid range based on the calculated number of permutations and the maximum possible value of f(p).
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of permutations of length n and finds the maximum possible value of f(p). It returns a positive integer m within the valid range based on the constraints provided.**
