According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range is from 1 to n+1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 0. The variable `k` will start from 1 and go up to n, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `b` decremented by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n+1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
