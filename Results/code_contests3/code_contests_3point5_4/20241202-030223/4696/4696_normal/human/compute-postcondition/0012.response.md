Example Answer: 
`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`, where `factorial` calculates the factorial of a number. The value of `n`, `k`, and `f` are known, so `f` is assigned the factorial of `(n - k)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` is a range from 1 to n, `k` is the current value of the loop + 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - k), `d` is the floor division of `i` by `f`, and the value at index `d` in `p` is printed.
