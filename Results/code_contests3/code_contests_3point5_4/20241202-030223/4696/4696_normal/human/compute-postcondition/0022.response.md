Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. The previous values of `i` and `f` are known, so the new value of `i` can be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the new remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` is a range from 1 to n with the element at index `d` removed, `k` is the current value of the loop + 2, `f` is the factorial of (n - k), `d` is the floor division of `i` by `f`, and the updated `p` after removing the element at index `d` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the new remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `p` is a range from 1 to n with the element at index `d` removed, `k` is the current value of the loop + 2, `f` is the factorial of (n - k), `d` is the floor division of `i` by `f`, and the updated `p` after removing the element at index `d` is printed**
