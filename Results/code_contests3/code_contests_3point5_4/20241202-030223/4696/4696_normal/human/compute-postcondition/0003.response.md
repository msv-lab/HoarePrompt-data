Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` can be any integer value based on the input `b`, so after execution, `i` will be one less than its original value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b` decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer value based on the input `a`, `i` is an integer value based on the input `b` decremented by 1**
