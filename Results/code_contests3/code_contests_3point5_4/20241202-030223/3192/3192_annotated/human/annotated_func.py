#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies. Each company description includes an integer m_i representing the number of employees in the company, followed by m_i integers representing the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive integers and do not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 â‹… 10^5.**
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = []
    maxval = 0
    arr2 = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
        temp = 0
        
        for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
            temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
        
        arr.append(temp)
        
        arr2.append(arr1[0])
        
        maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`, `arr2` contains the number of elements in each input list
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the sum of all the calculations for each element in `arr` and `arr2` based on the given formula
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of companies 'n' as input, followed by 'n' lines where each line contains the number of employees in a company and their salaries. It then calculates the average salary across all companies based on the maximum salary in each company. The function outputs the final calculated average salary. However, there is a potential issue in the code where the inner loop should iterate up to `arr1[0]` inclusive instead of excluding it. This could lead to incorrect calculations and impact the final average salary.
