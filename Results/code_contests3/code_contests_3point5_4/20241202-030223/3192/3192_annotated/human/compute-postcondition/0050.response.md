Example Answer:
The formula `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` is executed. The value of `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, so this operation is performed for each value of `i`. The value of `ans` is updated each time based on the formula using the corresponding values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i`. After the loop completes for all values of `i`, the final value of `ans` is calculated.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is updated based on the given formula for all values of `i` from 1 to `n`.**
