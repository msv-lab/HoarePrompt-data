Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies; `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies; `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
