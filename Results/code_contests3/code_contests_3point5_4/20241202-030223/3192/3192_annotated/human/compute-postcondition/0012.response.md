Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[3]`, where `j` is 3. The maximum value is updated accordingly. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
