Example Answer:
Initially, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between the elements in `arr1` and the current value of `maxval`. The value of `maxval` will be updated based on the comparison. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` contains the elements input by the user, `temp` is assigned the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the first element of `arr1`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, for the loop to execute `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`.**
