Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. Since `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, the maximum value is added to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`**
