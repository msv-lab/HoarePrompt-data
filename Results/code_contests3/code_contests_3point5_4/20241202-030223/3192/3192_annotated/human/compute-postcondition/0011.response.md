According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1` has at least 1 element with the first element greater than 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
