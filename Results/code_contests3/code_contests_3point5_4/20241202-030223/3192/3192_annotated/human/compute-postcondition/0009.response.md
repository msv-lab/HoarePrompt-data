According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
