Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` represents the number of companies. Since we do not have information about the specific values of `m_i` and the salaries of employees, the output state will only reflect that `n` has been assigned a positive integer value.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies**
