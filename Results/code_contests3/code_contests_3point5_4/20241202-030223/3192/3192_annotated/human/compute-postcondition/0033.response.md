According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. Since `j` is initialized to the first element of `arr1`, the loop will not execute in the current state. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than the first element of `arr1` for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` contains the elements input by the user, `temp` is 0, `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 2, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`**
