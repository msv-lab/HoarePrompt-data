According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` contains the elements input by the user, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the first element of `arr1`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`. For the loop to execute a third time `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` contains the elements input by the user, `temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and the element at index `j` in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the first element of `arr1`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, for the loop to execute a third time `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`**.
