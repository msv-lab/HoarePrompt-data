According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` remains the same as it is greater than 0. The loop will iterate to the next value of `i`, so `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the result of the calculation described above, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`**
