Functionality: **The function reads the number of companies 'n' as input, followed by 'n' lines where each line contains the number of employees in a company and their salaries. It then calculates the average salary across all companies based on the maximum salary in each company. The function outputs the final calculated average salary. However, there is a potential issue in the code where the inner loop should iterate up to `arr1[0]` inclusive instead of excluding it. This could lead to incorrect calculations and impact the final average salary.**
