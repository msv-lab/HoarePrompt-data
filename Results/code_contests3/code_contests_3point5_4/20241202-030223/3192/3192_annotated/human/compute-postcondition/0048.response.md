Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` in each iteration where `i` is less than `n+1`. The initial state provides that `n` is greater than 0, `arr` and `arr2` are properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, and `ans` is the result of previous calculations. After executing the code snippet, the value of `ans` is further updated based on the values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `i`. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the result of the calculation described above, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1` and `ans` is updated based on the given formula**
