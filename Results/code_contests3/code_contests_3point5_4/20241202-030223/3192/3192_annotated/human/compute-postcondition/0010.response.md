Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`. The initial state mentions that `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`, so after this execution, `temp` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
