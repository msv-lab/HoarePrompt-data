Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the first element of `arr1`, which is equal to the value of `j`. Since `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`**
