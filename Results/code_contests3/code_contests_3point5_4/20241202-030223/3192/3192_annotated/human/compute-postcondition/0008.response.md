Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` will be the maximum value between the current `temp` and the value at index `j` in `arr1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1**
