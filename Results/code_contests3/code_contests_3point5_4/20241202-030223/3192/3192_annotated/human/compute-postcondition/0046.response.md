Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` to its current value. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `n` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the result of the calculation described above.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the result of the calculation described above**
