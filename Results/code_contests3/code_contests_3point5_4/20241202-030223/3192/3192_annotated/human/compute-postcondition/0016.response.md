Example Answer:
`maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. Since `arr[i]` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it represents the maximum value in `arr1`. Therefore, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`**
