According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr1` and `j`. If arr1 has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element and the first element is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
