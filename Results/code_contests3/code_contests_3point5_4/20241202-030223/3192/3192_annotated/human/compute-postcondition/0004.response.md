According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `arr` and `arr2` being empty lists does not affect the loop execution. The `maxval` being 0 also does not affect the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
