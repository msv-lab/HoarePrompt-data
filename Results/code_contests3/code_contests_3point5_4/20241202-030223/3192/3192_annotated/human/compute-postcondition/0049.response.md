According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is the result of the calculation described above. For the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n+1`. So, for the next iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is properly initialized, `arr2` is properly initialized, `maxval` is updated, `ans` is updated based on the given formula, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is less than `n+1`**
