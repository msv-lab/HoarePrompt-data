According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr1` has at least 1 element, the first element is greater than 1, `temp` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, the maximum value of `arr1` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the maximum value of `arr1`, `maxval` holds the maximum value between all elements in `arr1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is incremented by 1**
