Example Answer:
`arr1` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input values obtained from `raw_input().split()`. As the initial state does not provide the specific input values, the output state will be `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from user input**
