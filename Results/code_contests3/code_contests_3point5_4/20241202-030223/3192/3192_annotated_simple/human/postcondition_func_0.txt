The function reads an integer `n` from the user, then iterates `n` times to read lists of integers. For each list, it calculates the maximum value excluding the first element, stores it in `arr`, and adds the first element to `arr2`. It then calculates the sum of products of the difference between the maximum value and each element in `arr` multiplied by the corresponding element in `arr2`, and prints the result.
