You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A conglomerate consists of n companies. To make managing easier, their owners have decided to merge all companies into one. By law, it is only possible to merge two companies, so the owners plan to select two companies, merge them into one, and continue doing so until there is only one company left.

But anti-monopoly service forbids to merge companies if they suspect unfriendly absorption. The criterion they use is the difference in maximum salaries between two companies. Merging is allowed only if the maximum salaries are equal.

To fulfill the anti-monopoly requirements, the owners can change salaries in their companies before merging. But the labor union insists on two conditions: it is only allowed to increase salaries, moreover all the employees in one company must get the same increase.

Sure enough, the owners want to minimize the total increase of all salaries in all companies. Help them find the minimal possible increase that will allow them to merge companies into one.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n — the number of companies in the conglomerate (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Each of the next n lines describes a company. 

A company description start with an integer m_i — the number of its employees (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). Then m_i integers follow: the salaries of the employees. All salaries are positive and do not exceed 10^9. 

The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. 

Output

Output a single integer — the minimal total increase of all employees that allows to merge all companies.

Example

Input


3
2 4 3
2 2 1
3 1 1 1


Output


13

Note

One of the optimal merging strategies is the following. First increase all salaries in the second company by 2, and merge the first and the second companies. Now the conglomerate consists of two companies with salaries [4, 3, 4, 3] and [1, 1, 1]. To merge them, increase the salaries in the second of those by 3. The total increase is 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = []
    maxval = 0
    arr2 = []
    for i in xrange(n):
        arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
        temp = 0
        
        for j in xrange(1, arr1[0]):
            temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
        
        arr.append(temp)
        
        arr2.append(arr1[0])
        
        maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1` in the loop, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`, `ans` is the sum of all the calculated values in the loop
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
