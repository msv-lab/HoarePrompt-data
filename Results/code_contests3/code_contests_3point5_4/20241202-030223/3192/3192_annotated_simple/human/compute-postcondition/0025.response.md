Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the value at index `j` in the array `arr1`. The value of `j` is increased by 1 before this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `temp` has been updated to the maximum value between the previous `temp` and `arr1[j]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `temp` has been updated to the maximum value between the previous `temp` and `arr1[j]`**
