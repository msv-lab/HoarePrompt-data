According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 to become 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
