Example Answer:
`arr2` is assigned an empty list, so after execution, `arr2` remains an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
