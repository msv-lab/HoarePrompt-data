According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be adjusted to 0 for the loop to start executing properly.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1` in the loop, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`, `ans` is 0**.
