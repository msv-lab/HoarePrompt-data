According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1` and the index `j`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and the integer at index `j` in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and the integer at index `j` in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended**
