According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `temp` is the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 3 of `arr1`**
