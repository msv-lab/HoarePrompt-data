According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1` and the value of the first element in the list. If the first element in `arr1` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3 and `j` is now 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `temp` is 0, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 3**
