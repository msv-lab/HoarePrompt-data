According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and the integer at index `j` in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 so that it is less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and the integer at index `j` in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended**.
