The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `temp`. However, `temp` will be updated based on the maximum value between its current value and the value at index `j` of `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `temp` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `temp` is updated accordingly**
