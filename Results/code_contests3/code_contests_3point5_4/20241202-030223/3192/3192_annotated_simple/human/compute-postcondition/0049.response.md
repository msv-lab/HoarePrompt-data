According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1` in the loop, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`, `ans` is updated with the calculated value, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is updated with the value calculated by the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`**
