According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1` for the loop to execute. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is 0, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `arr1` is assigned the list of integers input by the user, `j` is adjusted to `arr1[0] - 1`**
