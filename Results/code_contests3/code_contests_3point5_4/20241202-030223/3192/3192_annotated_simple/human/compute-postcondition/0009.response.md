According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr1[0]` and `j`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1 and it should still be less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
