Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 3 of `arr1`. Since `temp` is initially 0 and `arr1` is a list of integers, the maximum value between 0 and the value at index 3 of `arr1` is determined. The loop will execute a second time, and `temp` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `temp` is the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 3 of `arr1`**
