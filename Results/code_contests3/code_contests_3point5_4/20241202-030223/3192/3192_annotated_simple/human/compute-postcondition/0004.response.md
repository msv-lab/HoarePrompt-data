According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list and `maxval` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
