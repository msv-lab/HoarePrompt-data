According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1` in the loop, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`, `ans` is updated with the calculated value. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` should still be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of maximum values from each iteration of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of the last `arr1` in the loop, `temp` is the maximum value in the last `arr1`, `arr2` is a list of the first elements of each `arr1`, `ans` is updated with the calculated value, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 1**
