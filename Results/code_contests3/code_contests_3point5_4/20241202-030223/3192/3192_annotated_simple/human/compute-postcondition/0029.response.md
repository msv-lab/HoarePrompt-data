Example Answer:
The value of `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[i]` refers to the third element in the list. Therefore, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`. All other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended.**
