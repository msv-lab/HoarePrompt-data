According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**.
