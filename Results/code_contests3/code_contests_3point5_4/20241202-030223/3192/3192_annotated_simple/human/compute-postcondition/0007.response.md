According to the code, the loop will execute if arr1[0] is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the array arr is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to arr1 is a list of integers with at least 1 element. Since the loop starts from 1, i should be adjusted to 1. Additionally, maxval is not relevant to the loop execution, so it remains as 0. Finally, temp is not used in the loop, so it can remain as 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `temp` is 0**
