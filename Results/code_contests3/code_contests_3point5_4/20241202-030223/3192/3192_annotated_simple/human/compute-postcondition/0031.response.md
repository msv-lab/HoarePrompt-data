Example Answer:
`arr1` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. The previous values of `arr1`, `maxval`, `i`, `j`, `temp`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the third element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `temp` is appended to `arr` and `arr2` has the first element of `arr1` appended, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 3**
