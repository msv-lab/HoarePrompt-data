The code appends the maximum value in `arr1` to the list `arr`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, and the maximum value in `arr1` has been appended to `arr`.
