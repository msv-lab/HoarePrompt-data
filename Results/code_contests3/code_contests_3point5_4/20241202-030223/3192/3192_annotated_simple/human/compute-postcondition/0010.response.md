Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is initialized as 0 and `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `j` is 2, the value of `arr1[j]` is considered. After execution, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value (0) and the value at index 2 of `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `temp` is the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 2 of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `temp` is the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 2 of `arr1`**
