Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user, then iterates `n` times to read lists of integers. For each list, it calculates the maximum value excluding the first element, stores it in `arr`, and adds the first element to `arr2`. It then calculates the sum of products of the difference between the maximum value and each element in `arr` multiplied by the corresponding element in `arr2`, and prints the result.** 

The function does not have any specific output as mentioned in the annotations, but it reads input from the user, performs calculations based on the input, and prints the final result.
