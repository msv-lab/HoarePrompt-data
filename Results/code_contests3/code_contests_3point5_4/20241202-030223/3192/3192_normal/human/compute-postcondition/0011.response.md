According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration will be:
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1**
