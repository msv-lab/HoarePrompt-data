According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is at least 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, and `arr1[0]` needs to be greater than the new value of `j`.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute another time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`**
