Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The previous state of `temp` is based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, which means `temp` now holds the maximum value between the previous `temp` value and `arr1[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1**
