According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least equal to the total number of iterations. Additionally, `arr1` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` contains maximum values entered by the user in each iteration, so it doesn't ensure the loop will execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list containing maximum values entered by the user in each iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in the current `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in `arr1` for each iteration, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations and `arr1` has at least 1 element**
