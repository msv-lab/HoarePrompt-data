According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `temp` is still 0, `arr2` contains the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[3]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` remains the same at 3, and `n` is still greater than or equal to 1. So, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1` must have at least 1 element, `j` is 1, and the loop body executes.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user with an additional element at the end, `temp` is 0, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[3]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
