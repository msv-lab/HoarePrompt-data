Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is updated based on the comparison with the value of `arr1[j]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[j]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than the new value of `j`**
