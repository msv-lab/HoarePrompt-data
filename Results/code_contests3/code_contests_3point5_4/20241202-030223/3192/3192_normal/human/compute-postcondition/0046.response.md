Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each iteration based on the values of `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `i`. The loop will run for a total of `n` iterations. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list containing maximum values entered by the user in each iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in the current `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in `arr1` for each iteration, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `ans` is the calculated value after the loop execution.
Output State: **`arr` is a list containing maximum values entered by the user in each iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in the current `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is a list containing the total number of elements in `arr1` for each iteration, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `n` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `ans` is the calculated value after the loop execution**
