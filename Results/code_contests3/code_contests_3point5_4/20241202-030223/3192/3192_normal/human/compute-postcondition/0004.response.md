According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list and `maxval` is 0. To execute the loop, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `arr` is still an empty list.
State: **`arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
