According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user with an additional element at the end, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the j-th element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2. 
So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `j` must be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user with an additional element at the end, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the j-th element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
