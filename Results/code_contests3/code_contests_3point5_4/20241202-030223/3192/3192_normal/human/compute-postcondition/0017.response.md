According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the value of `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- The value of `maxval` should be updated based on the new value of `arr[2]` and the previous `maxval`.
- `arr` should be appended with the new maximum value in `arr1`.
- `arr2` should be appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr1[0]` is the total number of elements in `arr1`, `arr` is appended with the value of `temp`, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
