According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is the total number of elements in `arr1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 to 2 and `arr1[0]` should be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user with an additional element at the end, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the j-th element of `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
