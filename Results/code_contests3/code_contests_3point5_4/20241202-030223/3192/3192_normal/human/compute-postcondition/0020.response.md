According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, it is needed to adjust `temp` is 0, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr` is appended with the value of `temp`, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and as the loop is starting from 1, so it's the first iteration of the loop.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user, `temp` is 0, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr` is appended with the value of `temp`, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[2]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
