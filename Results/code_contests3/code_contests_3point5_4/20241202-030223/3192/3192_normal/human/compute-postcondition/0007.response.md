According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1[0]`. If arr1[0] is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 and `i` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is at least 2.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user using `raw_input().split()`, `maxval` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is 0, `arr1[0]` is at least 2**
