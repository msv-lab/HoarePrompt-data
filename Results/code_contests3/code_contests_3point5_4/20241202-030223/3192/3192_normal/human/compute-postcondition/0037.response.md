According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `j` should still be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`arr` is a list containing integers entered by the user with an additional element at the end, `temp` is the maximum value between the previous value of `temp` and the element at index `j+1` in `arr1`, `arr1` is a list containing integers entered by the user with at least 1 element, `arr2` is appended with the total number of elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[3]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `j` is 3**
