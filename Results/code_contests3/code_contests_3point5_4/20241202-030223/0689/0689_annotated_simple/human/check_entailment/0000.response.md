Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two strings `S` and `T` as input, then iterates through all possible rotations of string `T` and checks if any of them matches string `S`. If a match is found, it prints `Yes`, otherwise it prints `No`. This approach ensures that the program determines if `S` equals `T` after rotation, as specified in the problem description.
