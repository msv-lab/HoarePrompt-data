Functionality: **The function takes two input strings S and T of equal length. It rotates string T in all possible ways and checks if any rotation equals string S. It returns True if there exists a rotation of T that matches S, and False otherwise.** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle cases where the lengths of the input strings are different. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
- The code does not account for the scenario where both input strings are empty.
- The function does not provide any error handling for invalid inputs or edge cases.
