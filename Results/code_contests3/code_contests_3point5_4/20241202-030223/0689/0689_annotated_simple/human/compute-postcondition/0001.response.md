Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of the user input string. Since `s` is the user input string, and |S| = |T|, the length of `t` will be the same as the length of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of string X; `s` is the user input string, `t` is the user input string.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of string X; `s` is the user input string, `t` is the user input string**
