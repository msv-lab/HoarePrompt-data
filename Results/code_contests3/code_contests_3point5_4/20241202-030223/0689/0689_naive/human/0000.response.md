Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if string S equals string T after rotation. It generates all possible rotations of string T and checks if any of them match string S. The use of list comprehension and the any() function makes the code concise and efficient. Additionally, the program considers all possible cases by iterating through all possible rotations of T. Hence, based on the provided problem description and the examples, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
