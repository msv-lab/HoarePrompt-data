Correctness: **True**

The program reads two strings `S` and `T` as input, where both strings consist of lowercase English letters and have equal lengths between 2 and 100. It then checks if any rotation of string `T` matches string `S` by comparing all possible rotations of `T` with `S`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. This matches the problem description accurately.

The use of list comprehension and the `any` function allows the program to efficiently check all possible rotations of `T` and compare them with `S`. The program prints the correct output based on whether a matching rotation is found or not.
