Example Answer:
The code compares all possible rotations of string `t` with string `s` to check if they are equal. If any rotation matches `s`, it returns 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `s`, `t`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is assigned the value of the input string entered by the user, `t` is assigned the value of the input entered by the user.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T| where 2 <= |S| <= 100, `s` is assigned the value of the input string entered by the user, `t` is assigned the value of the input entered by the user**
