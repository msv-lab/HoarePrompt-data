The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on two strings, S and T, where both S and T consist of lowercase English letters. The length of both strings is between 2 and 100, and the lengths of S and T are equal (|S| = |T|). The function does not return any value, as the expected output or side effects are not provided.
