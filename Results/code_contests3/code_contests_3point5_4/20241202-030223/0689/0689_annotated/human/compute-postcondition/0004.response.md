Functionality: **The function `func` reads two strings `S` and `T` as input, where both strings consist of lowercase English letters. The strings have equal lengths between 2 and 100. The function then checks if any rotation of string `T` matches string `S` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
