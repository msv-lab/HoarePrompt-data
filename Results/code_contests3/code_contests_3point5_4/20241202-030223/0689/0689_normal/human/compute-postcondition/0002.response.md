Example Answer:
The code checks if any rotation of string `t` matches string `s`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The strings `s` and `t` are input strings entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `t` is the input string entered by the user, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the rotation match.
Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, |S| = |T|, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `t` is the input string entered by the user, and either 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the rotation match**
