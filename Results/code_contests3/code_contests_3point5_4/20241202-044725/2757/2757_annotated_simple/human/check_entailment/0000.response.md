Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. The program simply checks if the input string contains any vowels and returns True if it does not. This does not address the main requirement of identifying typos in a word based on consecutive consonants.

The program should instead check for blocks of three or more consecutive consonants with at least two different letters to identify typos. It should then insert spaces in the word to separate the word into multiple words, each without typos.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
