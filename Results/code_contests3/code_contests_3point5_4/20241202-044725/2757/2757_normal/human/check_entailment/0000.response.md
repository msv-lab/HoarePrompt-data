Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It fails to handle the case where a block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block is not considered a typo. 
- The code splits a word into multiple words whenever there are three consonants in a row, regardless of the letters being the same or different. This means that it does not cover the exception mentioned in the problem description.
- For example, for the input "helllllooooo", the code would incorrectly split it into "hell lllo ooooo" when it should not be considered a typo at all.
