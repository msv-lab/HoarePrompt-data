Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where there are multiple typos in the word. For example, if the input word is "hackcerrs", the program will output "ha ckc errs" which is not correct as it does not split the word into words without typos. So, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
