Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the described functionality. It does not handle the case where a block of consonants has all letters the same and is longer than three characters. In this case, the program should not consider it a typo, but the program does not account for this exception.

For example, for the input "helllllooooo", the program should output "helllllooooo" without making any changes. However, the program will incorrectly split it into "hell" "lllo" "oooo".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
