Correctness: **False**

The given code does not correctly implement the problem description. 

The issue lies in the line `digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())`. This line converts the input string into a list of integers, but it does not correctly split the digits of the ticket number. It should split the input string into individual digits, but instead, it treats the entire input as a single integer.

As a result, the code will not work as expected for ticket numbers with more than one digit. 

For example:
Input
```
4
4738
```
Output
```
YES
```
The output should be "NO" because the ticket number is not a lucky number and the sum of digits in the first half does not equal the sum of digits in the second half.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle cases where the ticket number has multiple digits.
