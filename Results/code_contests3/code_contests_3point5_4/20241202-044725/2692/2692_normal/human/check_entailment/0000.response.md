Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code reads the ticket number as a single integer instead of individual digits, which may lead to incorrect results when verifying if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. The code should be modified to correctly read and compare individual digits.
