Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 50 as the number of digits in a ticket number. The function then reads the ticket number digits and checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. This function specifically handles ticket numbers with `n` digits where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50. **
