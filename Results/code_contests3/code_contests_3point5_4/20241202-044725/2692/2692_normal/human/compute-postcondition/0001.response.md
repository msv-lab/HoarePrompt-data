Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespaces. Since `n` is specified to be an even integer between 2 and 50, the value of `n` will be an even integer between 2 and 50. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer between 2 and 50 and the ticket number is an integer with exactly n digits.
Output State: **n is an even integer between 2 and 50 and the ticket number is an integer with exactly n digits**
