Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an even integer `n` and a ticket number as input, then checks if the sum of the first half of the ticket number digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This is exactly what the problem description requires.
