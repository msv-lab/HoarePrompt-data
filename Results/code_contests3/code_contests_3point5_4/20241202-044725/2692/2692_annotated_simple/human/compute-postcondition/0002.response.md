Example Answer:
The code maps each character of the input string to an integer and stores the result in the variable digits. Since the input is assumed to be a valid even integer, the digits variable will contain a list of integers representing each digit of the input number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers representing each digit of n.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers representing each digit of n**
