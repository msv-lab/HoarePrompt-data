The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` between 2 and 50 from the standard input. It then reads the digits of `n` into a list. If the sum of the digits in the first half of the list is equal to the sum of the digits in the second half of the list, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
