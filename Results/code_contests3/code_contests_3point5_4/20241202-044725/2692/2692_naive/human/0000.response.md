Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the ticket number is not a lucky number. The program only checks if the sum of the digits in the first half is equal to the sum of digits in the second half, but it does not verify if the ticket number itself is a lucky number. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1234
```
The program will incorrectly output "YES" even though the ticket number is not a lucky number. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet all the requirements of the problem description.
