Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using dynamic programming to find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs. It iterates through all possible pairs of men and women, checks if they are compatible, and updates the number of ways accordingly. The final result is printed modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program handles all possible cases and constraints specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of ways Taro can make N pairs and prints the result as required.
