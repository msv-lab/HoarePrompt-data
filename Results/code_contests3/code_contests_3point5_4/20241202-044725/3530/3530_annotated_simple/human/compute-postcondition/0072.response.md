According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and if `j` is less than `n` the loop can execute again.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
