According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, and `j` is equal to `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n`, `mask` needs to be adjusted based on the value of `n`, and `j` needs to be adjusted to the value it takes in the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes**
