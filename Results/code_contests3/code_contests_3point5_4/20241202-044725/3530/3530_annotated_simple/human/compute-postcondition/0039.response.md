Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is a positive integer greater than 0, a contains the input values as integers for each iteration, _ is equal to n, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all i from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, mask is increased by 1. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated according to dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.***
