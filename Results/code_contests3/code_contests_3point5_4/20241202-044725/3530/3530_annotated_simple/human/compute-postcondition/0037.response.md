Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all i from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, `mask` is increased by 1, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
