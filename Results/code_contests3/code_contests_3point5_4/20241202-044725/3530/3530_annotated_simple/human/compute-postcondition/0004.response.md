Example Answer:
The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function converts the input values to integers and appends them to list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list and `raw_input().split()` takes input values, the values are appended to list `a`. The value of `MOD` is not affected, `n` remains greater than 0, and `_` remains 1.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers, `_` is 1**
