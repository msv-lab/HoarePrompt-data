Postcondition: ***`i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. `i` is increased by `n`. `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`. `j` is equal to `n`. `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is adjusted by taking the modulo of `MOD`.***
