According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `mask` must be less than `(1 << n)`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`.
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`**
