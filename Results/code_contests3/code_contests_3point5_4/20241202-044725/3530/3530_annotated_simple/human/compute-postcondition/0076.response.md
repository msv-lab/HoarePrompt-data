According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. `i` is increased by 1. `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1. `j` is set to 1. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
