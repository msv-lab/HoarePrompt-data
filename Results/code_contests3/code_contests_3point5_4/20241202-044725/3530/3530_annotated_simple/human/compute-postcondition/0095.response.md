Output State: **`i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The values of `dp[i][mask]` are updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, with the modulo `MOD` applied.**
