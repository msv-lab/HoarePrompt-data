Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the updated value after the XOR operation and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the updated value after the XOR operation and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`**.
