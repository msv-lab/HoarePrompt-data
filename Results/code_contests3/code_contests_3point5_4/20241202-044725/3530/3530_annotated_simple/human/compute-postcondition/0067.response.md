According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, and `j` takes the next value from 0 to n-1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is now increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is now 0.
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the next time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
