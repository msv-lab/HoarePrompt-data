According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `MOD` is 1000000007 and `a` is an empty list. So, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and after the first iteration, `_` is 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 1**
