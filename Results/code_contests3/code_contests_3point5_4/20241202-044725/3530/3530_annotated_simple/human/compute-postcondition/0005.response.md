According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers, and `_` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers, `_` is 2**
