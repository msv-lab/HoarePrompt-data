Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is modulo `MOD`.**
