Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the modulus of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` with respect to the value of `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `j` of the array `a[i - 1]` is 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the element at index `j` of the array `a[i - 1]` is 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly**
