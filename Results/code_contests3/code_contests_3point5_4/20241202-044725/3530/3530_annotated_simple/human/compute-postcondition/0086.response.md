Postcondition: ***`i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. Initially, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Subsequently, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.***
