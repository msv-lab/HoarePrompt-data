Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(n + 1) x (1 << n)` filled with zeros. Here, `n` is a positive integer, so `1 << n` represents the bitwise left shift operation by `n` bits, and `_` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, a 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(n + 1) x (1 << n)` filled with zeros.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, a 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(n + 1) x (1 << n)` filled with zeros**
