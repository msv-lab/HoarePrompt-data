According to the code, the loop will execute for all values of `i` from 0 to (1 << n) - 1. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, a 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions `(n + 1) x (1 << n)` filled with zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
