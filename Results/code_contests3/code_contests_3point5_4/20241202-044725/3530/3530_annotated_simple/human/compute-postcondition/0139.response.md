Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` remains equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The result is then taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `dp[i][mask]` is modulo `MOD`.**
