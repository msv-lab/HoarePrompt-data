Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `n` are already defined in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly**
