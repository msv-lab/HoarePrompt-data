Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `mask`, and `j` affect the calculation. The value of `mask` is updated to `(1 << n)`. Since `j` is equal to `n+1`, the value of `j` is updated accordingly. The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is dependent on the previous state of `dp` and the newly calculated `mask` value. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
