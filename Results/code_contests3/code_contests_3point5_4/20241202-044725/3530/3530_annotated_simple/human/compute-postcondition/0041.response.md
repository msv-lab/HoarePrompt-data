Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all i from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, `mask` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
