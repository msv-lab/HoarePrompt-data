According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was increased by `n`, `mask` took the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` was equal to `n-1`, and `n` was greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and should be less than `n`.
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time**.
