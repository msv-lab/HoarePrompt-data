According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n+1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`**.
