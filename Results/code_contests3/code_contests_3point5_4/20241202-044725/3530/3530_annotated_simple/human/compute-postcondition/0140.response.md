Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is modulo `MOD`.**
