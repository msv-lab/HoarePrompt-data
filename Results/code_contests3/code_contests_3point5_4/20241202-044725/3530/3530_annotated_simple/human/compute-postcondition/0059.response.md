According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask`. Since `mask` is increased by `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation.
State: **`MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same as in the initial state. `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation**
