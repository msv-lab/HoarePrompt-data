Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is increased by dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of i, mask, j, and n are used in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, and the value of dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
