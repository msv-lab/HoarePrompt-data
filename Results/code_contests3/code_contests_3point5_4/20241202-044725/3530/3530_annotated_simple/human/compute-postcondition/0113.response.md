According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range specified `(1, 1 << n)` is valid, meaning `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `n` need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
