Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The value of mask is updated to (1 << n) - 1. The value of j is 1. The value of n is greater than or equal to 1. The previous values of dp, mask, j, and n are influenced by the calculation. 
Output State: **dp[i][mask] has been updated based on dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is 1, and n is greater than or equal to 1**
