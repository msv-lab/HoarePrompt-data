According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j`, `n`, `mask` are integers. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`i`, `j` is updated, `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1`**
