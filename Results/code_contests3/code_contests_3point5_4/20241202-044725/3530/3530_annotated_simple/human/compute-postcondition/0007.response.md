According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. Since `_` is increased by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `_` must be 3.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers, `_` is 3, `a` is appended with the input values after converting them to integers using map(int, raw_input().split())**
