Example Answer:
The value of `mask` is incremented by `n + 1`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by performing a modulo operation on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned.**
