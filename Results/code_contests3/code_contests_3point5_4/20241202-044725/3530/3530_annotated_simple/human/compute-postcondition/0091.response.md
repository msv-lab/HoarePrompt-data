According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `n`. If the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are satisfied, then the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, these variables are in a certain state. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
