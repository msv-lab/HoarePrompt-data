Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.**
