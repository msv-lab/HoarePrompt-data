According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `mask` and `n`. If `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The values of `dp[i][mask]` are updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, with the modulo `MOD` applied. So for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be less than `(1 << n)`.
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` must be less than `(1 << n)`**
