According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and `dp[i][mask]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, these variables are appropriately updated based on the conditions. To execute the loop one more time, the loop variable `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, `j` needs to be updated accordingly.

State: **`i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `n`, `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][mask]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions**
