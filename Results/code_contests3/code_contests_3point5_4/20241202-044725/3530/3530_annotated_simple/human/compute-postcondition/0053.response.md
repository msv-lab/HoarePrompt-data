Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and adding it to dp[i][mask]. After that, dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. The variables MOD, n, a, _, dp remain the same as in the initial state. The value of mask is increased by n+1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD, n, a, _, dp remain the same as in the initial state. mask is increased by n+1. a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo MOD.
Output State: **MOD, n, a, _, dp remain the same as in the initial state. mask is increased by n+1. a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of mask is set. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. dp[i][mask] is then taken modulo MOD.**
