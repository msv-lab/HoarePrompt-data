Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. Since `MOD` is not specified, we can't determine the exact value of `dp[i][mask]` after the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
