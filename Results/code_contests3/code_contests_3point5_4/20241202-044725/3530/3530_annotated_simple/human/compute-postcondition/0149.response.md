According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n` because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to n-1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the next iteration:
State: **After the if-else block, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is updated appropriately, `j` is `n`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented by 1**
