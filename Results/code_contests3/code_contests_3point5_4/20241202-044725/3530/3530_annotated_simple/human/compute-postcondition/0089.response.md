Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulus with `MOD`. The previous values of variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation**
