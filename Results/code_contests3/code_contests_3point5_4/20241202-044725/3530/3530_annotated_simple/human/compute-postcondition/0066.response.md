According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is in the range from 1 to (1 << n) - 1. After the loop executes one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, `mask` will take the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, and `j` will take the next value from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` takes the next value from 0 to n-1, for the loop to execute the next time**
