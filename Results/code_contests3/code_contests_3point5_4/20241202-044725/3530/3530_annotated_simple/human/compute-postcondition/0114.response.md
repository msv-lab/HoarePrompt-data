According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0, which ensures the loop can execute. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` needs to be 0.
State: **`i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
