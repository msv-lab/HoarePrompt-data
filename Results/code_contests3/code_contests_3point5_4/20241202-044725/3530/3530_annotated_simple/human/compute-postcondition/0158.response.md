Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is equal to `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.**
