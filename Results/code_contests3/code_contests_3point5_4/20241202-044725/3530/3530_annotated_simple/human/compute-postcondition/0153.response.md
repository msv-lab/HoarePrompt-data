According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is such that it is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1.
State: **After executing the code, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j+1)]`, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain unchanged, the `j+1`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1.**
