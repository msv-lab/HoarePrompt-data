Output State: After executing the code, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain the same as mentioned in the initial state. Additionally, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1.
**After the if-else block, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is updated appropriately, `j` is `n`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1.**
