According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be increased by `n`, `mask` will take the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `n+1`, `mask` should still be `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` should be equal to `n`, and `n` should remain greater than or equal to 0.
State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be increased by `n+1`, `mask` will take the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to 0**.
