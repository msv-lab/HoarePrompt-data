Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `mask` takes the next value from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
