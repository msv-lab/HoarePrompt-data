Example Answer: 
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo MOD. The value of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and the previous value of `mask` remain unchanged. The j+1-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo MOD; `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain unchanged; the j+1-th bit of `mask` is set to 1; `mask` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo MOD; `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain unchanged; the j+1-th bit of `mask` is set to 1; `mask` is incremented by 1**
