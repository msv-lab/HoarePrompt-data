According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the `mask` is within the range `1` to `(1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, the values were not specified. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, and `j` is equal to `n-1`**.
