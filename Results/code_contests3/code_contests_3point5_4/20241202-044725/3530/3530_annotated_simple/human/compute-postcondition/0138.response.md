According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` stays as 1, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `dp[i][mask]` is modulo `MOD`.**
