Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: variables `i`, `j` are updated, `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1.
Output State: **variables `i`, `j` are updated, `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1**
