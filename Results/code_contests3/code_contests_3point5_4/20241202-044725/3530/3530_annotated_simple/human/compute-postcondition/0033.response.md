Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all i from 0 to (1 << n) - 1. The loop will execute for all values of j from 0 to n-1. For each iteration, if a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] will be updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taken modulo MOD.**
