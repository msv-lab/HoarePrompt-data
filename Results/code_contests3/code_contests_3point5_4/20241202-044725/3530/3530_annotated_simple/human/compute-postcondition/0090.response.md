Postcondition: ***`i`, `mask`, `j`, `n` are integers. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation.***
