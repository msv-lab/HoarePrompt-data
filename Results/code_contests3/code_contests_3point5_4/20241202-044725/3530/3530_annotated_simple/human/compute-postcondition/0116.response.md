Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial values of the variables are provided, so we can calculate the result. The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is affected by the bitwise XOR operation `mask ^ 1 << j`. The output state will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] with the updated value after the XOR operation.**
