Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same. The value of `mask` is increased by `n + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation.
Output State: **`MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation**
