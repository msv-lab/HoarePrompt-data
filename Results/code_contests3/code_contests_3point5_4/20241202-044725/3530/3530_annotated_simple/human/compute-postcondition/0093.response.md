Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i][mask]` with the variable `MOD`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is set to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time and `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly**
