Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `mask` will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `dp[i][mask]` will be adjusted based on the calculations `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo of `MOD`.**
