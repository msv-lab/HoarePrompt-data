Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo MOD. The values of i, mask, j, and n are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i][mask] has been updated based on dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is 1, and n is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **dp[i][mask] has been updated based on dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], where mask is (1 << n) - 1, j is 1, and n is greater than or equal to 1**
