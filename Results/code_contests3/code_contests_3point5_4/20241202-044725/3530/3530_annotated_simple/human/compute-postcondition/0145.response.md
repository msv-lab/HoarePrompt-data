Postcondition: ***After the loop finishes executing, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is updated appropriately, `j` is `n-1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be incremented by 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1***
