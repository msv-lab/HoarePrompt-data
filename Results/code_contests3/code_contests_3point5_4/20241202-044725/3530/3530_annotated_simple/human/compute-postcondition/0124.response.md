Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `n`, `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][mask]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **`i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `n`, `mask`, `a[i - 1][j]`, `dp[i][mask]` are appropriately updated based on the conditions**
