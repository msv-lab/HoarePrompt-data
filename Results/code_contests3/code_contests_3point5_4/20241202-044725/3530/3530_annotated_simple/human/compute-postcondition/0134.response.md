According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1**
