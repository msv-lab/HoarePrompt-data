Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, and the value of `j` is 0. The conditions in the loop update `dp[i][mask]` appropriately for all iterations after the loop finishes. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mask` is appropriately updated based on the value of `n`, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1**
