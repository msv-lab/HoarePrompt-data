According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask` and `n`. If `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `mask` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `(1 << n)`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is increased by `n+1`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is appropriately updated based on the conditions in the loop for all iterations after the loop finishes**.
