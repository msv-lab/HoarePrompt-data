Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` contains the input values as integers for each iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (1 << n) filled with zeros, dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all i from 0 to (1 << n) - 1, i is 1, mask is 1, j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, and mask & 1 << j. The code snippet `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is executed. All the calculations are done modulo `MOD` as per the code.**
