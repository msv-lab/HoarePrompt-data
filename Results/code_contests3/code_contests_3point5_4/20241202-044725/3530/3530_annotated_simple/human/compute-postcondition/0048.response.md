Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, the values of MOD, n, a, _, and dp remain the same as in the initial state. The mask variable is increased by n. If the condition a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j is met for each iteration, then dp[i][mask] will be updated according to dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.**
