Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
