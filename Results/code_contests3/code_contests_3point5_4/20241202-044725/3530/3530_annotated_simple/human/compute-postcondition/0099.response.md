Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `mask`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]` are specified in the initial state. After execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by the previous state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is adjusted accordingly**
