According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, and `j` is equal to `n-1`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, and `j` is now 0.
State: **`i` is increased by `n`, `mask` takes the value of `(1 << n)`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
