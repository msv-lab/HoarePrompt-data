Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `n`, `mask` are integers. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `i` is increased by `n`, `mask` is updated, `j` is updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.***
