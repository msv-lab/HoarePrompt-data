Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous states of the variables are not provided, but based on the operation, `dp[i][mask]` should be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD, n, a, _`, and `dp` remain the same as in the initial state, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the specified operation.
Output State: **`MOD, n, a, _`, and `dp` remain the same as in the initial state, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the specified operation**.
