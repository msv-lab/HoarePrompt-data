Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `dp` are unknown, so the specific values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: variables `i`, `j` are updated, `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1`.
Output State: **variables `i`, `j` are updated, `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1**
