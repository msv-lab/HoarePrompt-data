Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be increased by `n`, `mask` will take the value of `(1 << n) - 1`, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` will be greater than or equal to 0. The values of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, with the modulo `MOD` applied.**
