According to the code, the loop can execute again if `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is updated appropriately, `j` is `n-1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be less than `(1 << n)`. So the next iteration should have `mask` incremented by 1.
State: **After the loop finishes executing, `i` is still equal to `n`, `mask` is updated appropriately, `j` is `n-1`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented by 1.**
