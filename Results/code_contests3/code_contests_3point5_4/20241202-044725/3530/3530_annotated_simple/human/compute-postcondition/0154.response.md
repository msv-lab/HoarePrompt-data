Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << (j+1)]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain unchanged. Additionally, the `j+1`-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `mask` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **The value of dp[i][mask] is updated; `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, and `mask` remain unchanged; the j+1-th bit of `mask` is set to 1; `mask` is incremented by 1.**
