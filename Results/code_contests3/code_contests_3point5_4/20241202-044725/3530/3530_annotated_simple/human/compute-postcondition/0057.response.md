Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value with `MOD`. The variables `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same as in the initial state, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation.
Output State: **`MOD, n, a, _, dp` remain the same as in the initial state, `mask` is increased by `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation**
