According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the variable mask needs to be 1 for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 initialized with ones, mask is 1**
