Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`, where `MOD` is 1000000007. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided, so the updated value will depend on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007**
