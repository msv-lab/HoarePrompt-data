Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time.
