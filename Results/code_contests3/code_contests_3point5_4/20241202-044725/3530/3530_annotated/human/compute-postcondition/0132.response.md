Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are unknown, so the output state is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`**
