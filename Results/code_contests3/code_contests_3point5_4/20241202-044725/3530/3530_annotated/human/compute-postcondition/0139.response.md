Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `mask` are not changed in this operation. The value of `mask ^ 1 << j` is calculated based on the previous value of `mask` and `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time.
