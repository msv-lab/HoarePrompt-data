State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each i and mask combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1**
