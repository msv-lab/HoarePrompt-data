Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` with `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then the program updates the values of `dp` for the given conditions.***
