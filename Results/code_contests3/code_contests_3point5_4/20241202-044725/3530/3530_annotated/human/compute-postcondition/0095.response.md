Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The elements at index (i-1, j) of `a` are equal to 1 and the corresponding bits of `mask` are set based on the conditions in the if statement.**
