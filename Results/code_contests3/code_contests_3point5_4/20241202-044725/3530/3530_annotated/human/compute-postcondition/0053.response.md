Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with the value of `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are unknown, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` contains the updated value after taking the modulo operation with an unknown `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the updated value after taking the modulo operation with an unknown `MOD`**
