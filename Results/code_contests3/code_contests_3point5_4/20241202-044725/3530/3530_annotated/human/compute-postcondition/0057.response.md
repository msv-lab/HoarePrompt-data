Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` contains the updated value with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, and `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be within the range 0 to `n-1.**
