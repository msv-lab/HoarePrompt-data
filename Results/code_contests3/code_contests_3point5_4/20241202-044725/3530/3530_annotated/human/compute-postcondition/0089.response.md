Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD` as 1000000007. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `MOD`, `i`, and `mask` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after executing the loop for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after executing the loop for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1**
