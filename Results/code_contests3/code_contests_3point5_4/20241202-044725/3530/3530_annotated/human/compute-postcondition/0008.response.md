Example Answer:
`map(int, raw_input().split())` converts the input values to integers and creates a list. This list is then appended to the existing list `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a`, `n`, or the input values, the output state will be: MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping the input values to integers and is appended with the mapped integer values from the input split.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping the input values to integers and is appended with the mapped integer values from the input split**
