Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`.**
