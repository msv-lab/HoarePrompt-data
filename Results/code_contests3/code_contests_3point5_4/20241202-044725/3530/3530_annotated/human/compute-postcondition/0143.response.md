According to the code, the loop can execute for all values of `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The loop executes for all values of `j` in the range of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` needs to be updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`.
State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` needs to be updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`**
