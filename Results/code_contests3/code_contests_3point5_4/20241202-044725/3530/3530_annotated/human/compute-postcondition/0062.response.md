Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` contains the updated value with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. The values of `n`, `j`, and `mask` remain in their respective valid ranges. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be within the range 0 to `n-1. The conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` hold true based on the updated values of `dp`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` for the successful execution of the if else block.***
