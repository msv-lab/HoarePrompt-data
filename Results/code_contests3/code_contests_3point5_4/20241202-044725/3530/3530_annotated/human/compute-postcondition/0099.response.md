Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
