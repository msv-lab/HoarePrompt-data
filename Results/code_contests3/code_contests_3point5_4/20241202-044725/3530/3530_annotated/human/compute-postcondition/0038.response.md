Output State: **`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. In the if condition, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of `MOD`.**
