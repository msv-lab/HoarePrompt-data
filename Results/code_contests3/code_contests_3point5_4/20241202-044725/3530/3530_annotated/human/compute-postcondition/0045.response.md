Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` and `mask` are not affected by this operation. However, the value of `j` is used in the calculation, and it is required to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. 
Output State: **`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1**
