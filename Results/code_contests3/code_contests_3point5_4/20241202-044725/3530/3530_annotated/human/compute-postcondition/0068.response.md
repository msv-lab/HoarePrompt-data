Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each i and mask combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. `MOD` remains 1000000007. `n` is still greater than 0. `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`. `mask` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1. `a` is a 2D array. The value at index i-1 and j in array `a` is 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1.***
