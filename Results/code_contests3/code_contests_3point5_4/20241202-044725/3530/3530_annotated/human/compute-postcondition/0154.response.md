Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i` and `mask` are not directly affected by this operation. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
