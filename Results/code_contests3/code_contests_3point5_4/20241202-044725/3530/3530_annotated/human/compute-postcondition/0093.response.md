Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are taken into account before the modulo operation is applied. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the modulo operation.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the modulo operation.**
