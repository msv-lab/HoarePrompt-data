Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` and `mask` are provided in the initial state, and the value of `j` is used for calculation. After the execution, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified accordingly based on the formula provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`.
