Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not specified, so it's not possible to determine the exact resulting values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time.
