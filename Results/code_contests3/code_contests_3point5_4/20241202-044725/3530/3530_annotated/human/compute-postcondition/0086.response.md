Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after applying the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` for the next `mask` value. The loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The element at index (i-1, j) of `a` is equal to 1 and the jth bit of `mask` is set.***
