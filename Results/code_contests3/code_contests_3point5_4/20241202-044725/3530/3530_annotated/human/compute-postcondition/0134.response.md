According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than `1 << n`. For the next iteration to occur, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `mask` should still be less than `1 << n`.
State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time**
