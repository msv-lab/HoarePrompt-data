Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
