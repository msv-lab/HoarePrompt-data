Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `j` is incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set, then the function executes specific operations based on these conditions.***
