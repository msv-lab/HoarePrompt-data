Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i-1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the contents of `dp` are not provided, so the exact values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`**
