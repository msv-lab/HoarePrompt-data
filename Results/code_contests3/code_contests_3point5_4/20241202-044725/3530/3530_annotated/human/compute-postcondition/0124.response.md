Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`**
