Postcondition: ***`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1` (updated value), `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with 1000000007.***
