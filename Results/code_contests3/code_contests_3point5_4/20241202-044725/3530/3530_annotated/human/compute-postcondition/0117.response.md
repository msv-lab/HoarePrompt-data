Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. The previous values of `i` and `mask` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation**
