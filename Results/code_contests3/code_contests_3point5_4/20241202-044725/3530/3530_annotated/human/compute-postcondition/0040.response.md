At the end of the last iteration, `dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, and `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range of 0 to `n-1`.
State: **`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1` (updated value), `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1**.
