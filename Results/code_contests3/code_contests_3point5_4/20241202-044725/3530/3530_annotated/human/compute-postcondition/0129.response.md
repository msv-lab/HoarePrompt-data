According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `1 << n`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than `1 << n`.
State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time**
