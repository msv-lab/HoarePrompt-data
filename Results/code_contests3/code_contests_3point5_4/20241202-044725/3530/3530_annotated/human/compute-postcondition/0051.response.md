Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp` contains updated values for each i and mask combination, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next value of `mask` should be within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1***
