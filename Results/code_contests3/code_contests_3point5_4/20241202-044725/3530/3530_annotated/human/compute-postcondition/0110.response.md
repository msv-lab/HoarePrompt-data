Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The loop has completed all iterations for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and all conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` have been checked, updating the values in `dp` accordingly.**
