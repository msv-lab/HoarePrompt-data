Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` and `mask` are given in the initial state, and `j` is 0. The calculation depends on the previous values of `dp` at index `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The output state will reflect the updated `dp` values after the operation.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination**
