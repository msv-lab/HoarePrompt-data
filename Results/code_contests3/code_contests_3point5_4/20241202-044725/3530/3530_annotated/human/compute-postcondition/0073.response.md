Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` and `mask` could be any updated values based on previous calculations. Since we are using the modulo operation with `MOD`, the final result will also be modulo `MOD` (1000000007). Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007.**
