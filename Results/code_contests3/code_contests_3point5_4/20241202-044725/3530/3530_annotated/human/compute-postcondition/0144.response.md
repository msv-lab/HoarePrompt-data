According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 
Before the loop starts, `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, so this state does not ensure that the loop will execute one more time. 
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `mask` needs to be updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, and `j` should be incremented by 1.
