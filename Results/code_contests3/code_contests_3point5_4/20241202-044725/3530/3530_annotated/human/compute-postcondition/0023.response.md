Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of `dp[i][mask]` with the value of `MOD`. Since `MOD` is 1000000007, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 initialized with ones, mask is 1, and dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulus with 1000000007**.
