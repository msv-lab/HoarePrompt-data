According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination, the next `mask` value should be considered. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to the next `mask` value is ready to be processed.
State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination, the next `mask` value is ready to be processed**
