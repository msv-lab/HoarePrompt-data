Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `dp`, `MOD`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` are already updated. The output state is: `dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1` (updated value), `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned above.
Output State: **`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1` (updated value), `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated**
