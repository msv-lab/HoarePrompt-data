Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `mask ^ 1 << j` flips the jth bit of `mask` and `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` has a specific value based on the previous calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each i and mask combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. `MOD` remains 1000000007. `n` is still greater than 0. `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`. `mask` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is 1. `a` is a 2D array. The value at index i-1 and j in array `a` is 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1.
