Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`, and the loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`, and the loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`**
