Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 initialized with ones, mask is 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulus with 1000000007.***
