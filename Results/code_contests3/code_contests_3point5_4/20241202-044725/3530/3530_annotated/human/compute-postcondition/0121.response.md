Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD` as 1000000007. The previous values of `i` and `mask` are not explicitly mentioned, but they are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007**
