Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its current value with `MOD`, which is 1000000007. The other variables `MOD`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1.
Output State: **`dp` contains updated values, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1**
