Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of MOD, n, a, and mask remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 initialized with ones, mask is 1, and dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
