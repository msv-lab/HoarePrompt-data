According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is an input value, and `a` is an empty list. To execute the loop successfully, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. 
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list**
