According to the code, for the loop to execute the next time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1, and `dp[0][1]` should be set to 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x (some value) initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
