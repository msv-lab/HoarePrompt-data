Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`, and the loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the bit set at position `j`, then the updated values in `dp` for `i` and `mask` will be determined based on this condition.***
