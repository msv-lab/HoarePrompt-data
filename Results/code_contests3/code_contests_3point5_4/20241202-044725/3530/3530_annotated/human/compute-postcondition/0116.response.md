Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. The values of `i` and `mask` are `n+1` and within the range of `1` to `1 << n` respectively. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set. 
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set**
