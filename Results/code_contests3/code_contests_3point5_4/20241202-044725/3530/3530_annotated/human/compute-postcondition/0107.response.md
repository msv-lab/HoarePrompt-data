Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are already updated within the loop. Therefore, after this operation, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` will depend on the updated values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`, and the loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`.**
