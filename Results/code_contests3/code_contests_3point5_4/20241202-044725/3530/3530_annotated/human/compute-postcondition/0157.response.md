Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The loop iterates through each `j` in the range of `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `jth` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The loop will update `dp`, `mask`, and `j` until all iterations have been completed.**
