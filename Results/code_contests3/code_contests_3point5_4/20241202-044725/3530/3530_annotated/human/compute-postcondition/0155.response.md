Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation, `mask` is updated, `j` is incremented by 1 if less than `n`**
