Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. The loop is now on the next value of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask has the j-th bit set, then the program continues with the updated values of `dp`.***
