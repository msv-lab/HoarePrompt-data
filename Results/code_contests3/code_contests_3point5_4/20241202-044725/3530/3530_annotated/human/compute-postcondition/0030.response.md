Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 with updated values, mask is 1, the loop continues until j is less than n, j is incremented by 1.
