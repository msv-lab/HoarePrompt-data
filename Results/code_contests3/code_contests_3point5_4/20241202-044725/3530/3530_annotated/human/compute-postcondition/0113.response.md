According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`. Since `i` needs to be `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted to `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`. 
State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n`**
