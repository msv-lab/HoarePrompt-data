Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `i` and `mask` are not explicitly given, but after the modulo operation, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination. The value of `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. Also, the value of `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
