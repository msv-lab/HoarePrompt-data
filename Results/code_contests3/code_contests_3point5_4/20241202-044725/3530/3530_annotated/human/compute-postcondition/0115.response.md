Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n`. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set***
