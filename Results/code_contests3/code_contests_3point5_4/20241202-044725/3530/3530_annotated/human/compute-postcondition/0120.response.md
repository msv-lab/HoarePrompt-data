Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not explicitly provided, so it's difficult to determine the exact values after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `i` is `n+1`, `mask` is within the range of `1` to `1 << n` for the loop to execute one more time, `j` is less than `n+1`.
