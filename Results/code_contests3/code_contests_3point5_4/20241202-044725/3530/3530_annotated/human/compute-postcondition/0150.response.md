Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The `mask` variable is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are needed to calculate the exact result.
Output State: **`dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after taking the modulo operation with `MOD`, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `1 << n`, `j` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.**
