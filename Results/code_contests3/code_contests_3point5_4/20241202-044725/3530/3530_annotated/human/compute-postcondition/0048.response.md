Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `dp` contains updated values for each i and mask combination, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` is still greater than 0, `j` is within the range 0 to `n-1`, `mask` is within the range 1 to 2^n - 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with 1000000007.**
