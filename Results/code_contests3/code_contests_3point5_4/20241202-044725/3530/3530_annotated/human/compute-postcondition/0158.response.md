Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, `dp` contains the final updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. The loop iterates over the range of `n` and updates `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and if the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set.**
