According to the code, the loop will execute for every value of `i` in the range `(1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value within the range, and `dp[0][i]` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be considered, which is `i + 1`. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, `dp` is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x (some value) initialized with zeros, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is 1, `dp[0][i]` is 1**
