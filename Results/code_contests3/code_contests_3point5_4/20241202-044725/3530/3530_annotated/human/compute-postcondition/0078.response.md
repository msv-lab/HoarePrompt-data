Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value with `MOD`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `MOD` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`**
