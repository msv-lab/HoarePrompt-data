Postcondition: ***`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`. The modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 has been applied to `dp[i][mask]` for the next `mask` value. The element at index (i-1, j) of `a` is equal to 1 and the jth bit of `mask` is set. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than `n-1`.***
