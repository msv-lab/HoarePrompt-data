Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The bitwise XOR operation is used to flip the jth bit of `mask`. As the loop is executing for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1`, the next `mask` value is calculated using the modulo operation with `MOD` as 1000000007. The element at index (i-1, j) of `a` is assumed to be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination after the loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n`. The modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 has been applied to `dp[i][mask]` for the next `mask` value. The element at index (i-1, j) of `a` is equal to 1 and the jth bit of `mask` is set.
