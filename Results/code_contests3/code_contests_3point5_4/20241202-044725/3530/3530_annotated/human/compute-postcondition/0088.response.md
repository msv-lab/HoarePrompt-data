Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The element at index (i-1, j) of `a` is equal to 1, and the jth bit of `mask` is set. The loop has executed for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1` for each `i` and `mask` combination. After applying the operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` for the next `mask` value, the updated values are stored in `dp` with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after executing the loop for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1.
Output State: **`dp` contains the updated values for each `i` and `mask` combination with the modulo operation using `MOD` as 1000000007 after executing the loop for all values of `j` within the range 0 to `n-1.**
