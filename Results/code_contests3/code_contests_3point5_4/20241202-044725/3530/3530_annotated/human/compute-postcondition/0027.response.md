Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is 1000000007. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the output state is as follows:
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, n is greater than 0, a is a list containing the result of mapping all input values to integers, dp is a 2D list of size (1 << n) x 1 with updated values, mask is 1, the loop continues until j is less than n**
