Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2. The loop iterates over all values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and for each valid `j`, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`.**
