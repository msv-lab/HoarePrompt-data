Output State: **`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
