Example Answer:
Since the code snippet appends the result of mapping the input to integers into list `a`, the output state will be that list `a` now contains the mapped integer values from the input. The values of `N` and `MOD` remain the same.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, a contains the mapped integer values from the input**
