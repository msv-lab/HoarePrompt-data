Postcondition: ***All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then all `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, `dp[2][3]` is updated based on the formula and taken modulo MOD.***
