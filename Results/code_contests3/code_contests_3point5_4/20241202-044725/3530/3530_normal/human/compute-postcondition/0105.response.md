Postcondition: ***All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1. After executing the code snippet, if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, all `dp[i][mask]` values are recalculated by taking the modulo of their previous values with `MOD`.***
