Postcondition: ***`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, mask is 1, `j` is 0. In addition, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by `j` is true.***
