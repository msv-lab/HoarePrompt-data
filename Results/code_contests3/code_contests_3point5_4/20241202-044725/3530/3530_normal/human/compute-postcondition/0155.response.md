Output State: All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute again, and the conditions related to `a` and `dp` have been maintained. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.
Output State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated accordingly, `dp[i][mask]` has been modified by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`**
