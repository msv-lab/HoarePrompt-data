Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` is `mask + 1`. `n` is greater than 0. `a` is a 2D array. The element at index `(i - 1, j)` of `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is not equal to 0.***
