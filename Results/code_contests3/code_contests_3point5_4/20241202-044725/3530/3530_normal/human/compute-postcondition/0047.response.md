Postcondition: ***`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, conditions for `a[i][j]` and `mask` are satisfied. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions and taken modulo MOD, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.***
