According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be 1.
State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1**
