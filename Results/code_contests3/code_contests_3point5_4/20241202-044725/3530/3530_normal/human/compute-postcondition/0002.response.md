Example Answer:
No variables are affected by the code snippet `a = []`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007**
