Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the modulo operation, `mask` is now `mask + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a 2D array, `j` has been incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the program executes certain operations. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program variables.***
