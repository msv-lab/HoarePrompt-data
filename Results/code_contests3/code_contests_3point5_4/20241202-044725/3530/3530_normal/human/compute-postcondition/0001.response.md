Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input. The previous values of `N`, `a_{i, j}`, and `MOD` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007**
