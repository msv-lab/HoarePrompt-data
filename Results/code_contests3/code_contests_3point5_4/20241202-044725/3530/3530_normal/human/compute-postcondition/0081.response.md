According to the code, the loop can execute again if the `mask` value is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` value needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2**
