According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `j` has been incremented by 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1. This means that the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and the `mask` value needs to be updated to represent the next bit position.
State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask` has the (j+1)th bit set to 1**
