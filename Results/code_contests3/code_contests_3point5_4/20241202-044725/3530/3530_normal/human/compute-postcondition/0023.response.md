Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the modulo of dp[i][mask] by MOD. Since the initial state mentions that dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), we know that dp[i][mask] will be updated based on this formula. The other variables do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), i is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, mask is 1, j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), i is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, mask is 1, j is 0, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, bitwise AND operation between mask and 1 left shifted by j is true, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula provided**
