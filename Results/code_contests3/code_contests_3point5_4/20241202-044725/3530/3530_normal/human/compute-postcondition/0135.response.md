Output State: All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask` has the (j+1)th bit set to 1. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
