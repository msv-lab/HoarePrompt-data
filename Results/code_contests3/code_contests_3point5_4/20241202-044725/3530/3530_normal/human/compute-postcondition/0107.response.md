Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2, the value of `dp[2][3]` will be updated based on the formula provided. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, `dp[2][3]` is updated based on the formula.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, `dp[2][3]` is updated based on the formula**
