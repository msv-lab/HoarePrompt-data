Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Since the values of all `dp[i][mask]` have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, the modulo operation will be applied to the existing values of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3**
