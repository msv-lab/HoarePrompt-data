According to the code, the loop executes for `i` ranging from 1 to n. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 3.
State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is equal to `(1 << n) - 1`, `i` is 3**
