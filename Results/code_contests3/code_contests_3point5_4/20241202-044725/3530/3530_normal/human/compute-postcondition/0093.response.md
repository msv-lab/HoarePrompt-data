Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo `MOD`. Since all `dp[i][mask]` values were already updated based on the given formula and now they are being taken modulo `MOD`, the output state remains the same with all `dp[i][mask]` values being modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1. All `dp[i][mask]` values are now modulo `MOD`**
