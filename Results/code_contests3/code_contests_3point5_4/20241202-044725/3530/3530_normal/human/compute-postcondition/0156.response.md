Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute again, and the conditions related to `a` and `dp` have been maintained. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then all `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated accordingly, and `dp[i][mask]` has been modified by taking the modulo operation with `MOD`.***
