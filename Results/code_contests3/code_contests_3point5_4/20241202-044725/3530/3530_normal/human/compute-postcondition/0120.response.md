Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since all `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, the current value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is known. After the calculation, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n` and `j` should be increased by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the new value.
Output State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n` and `j` should be increased by 1, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the new value**.
