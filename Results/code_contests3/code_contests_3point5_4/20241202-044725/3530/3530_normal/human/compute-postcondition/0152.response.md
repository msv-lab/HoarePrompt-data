Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute again, and the conditions related to `a` and `dp` have been maintained. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set, then certain operations have been performed, otherwise no changes have been made.***
