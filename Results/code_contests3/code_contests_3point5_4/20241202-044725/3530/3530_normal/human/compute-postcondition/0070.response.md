Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` has the jth bit set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been taken modulo `MOD`**
