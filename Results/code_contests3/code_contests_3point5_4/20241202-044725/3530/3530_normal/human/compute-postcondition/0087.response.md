According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1**
