According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `a`, and `mask`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1. 
State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1**
