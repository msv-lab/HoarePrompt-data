Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is not affected, it remains greater than 0. The array `a` is not affected. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the modulo operation, `mask` is now `mask + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a 2D array, `j` has been incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**.
