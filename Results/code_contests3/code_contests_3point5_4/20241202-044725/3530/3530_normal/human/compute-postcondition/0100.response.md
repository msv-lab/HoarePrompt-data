Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is true. After execution of the code snippet, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to its previous value.**
