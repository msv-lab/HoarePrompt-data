Example Answer:
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `1000000007`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: N is a positive integer, and a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, and a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007**
