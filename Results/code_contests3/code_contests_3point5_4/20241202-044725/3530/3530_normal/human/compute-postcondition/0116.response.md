Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since all `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is the sum of the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial state provides that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask` has the `j-th` bit set to 1, allowing the update to occur. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3**
