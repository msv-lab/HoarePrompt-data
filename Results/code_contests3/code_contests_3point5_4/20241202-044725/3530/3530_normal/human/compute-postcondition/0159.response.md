Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been correctly updated for all valid `i`, `mask`, and `j` values within the loop. The values of `dp[i][mask]` have been computed based on the conditions specified in the loop code for each valid `j` value. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is `(1 << n) - 1`, `i` is `n`. The remainder operation with `MOD` has been applied to all updated `dp[i][mask]` values.**
