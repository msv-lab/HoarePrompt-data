Postcondition: ***All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the `j-th` bit set, then the program will update the `dp[3][mask]` value accordingly.***
