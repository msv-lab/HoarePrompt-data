Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1***
