Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and populates a matrix `a` of size N x N with integer values. It then performs a series of calculations on a dynamic programming table `dp` based on the values in matrix `a` and prints the final result. The function does not accept any parameters and its main functionality revolves around matrix manipulations and dynamic programming operations.**
