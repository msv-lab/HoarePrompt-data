The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to work with a matrix of size N x N, where N is a positive integer, and each element a_{i, j} in the matrix is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N. The function operates on this matrix but does not return any specific output.
