Postcondition: ***All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1. All `dp[i][mask]` values are now modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bit at position `j` in `mask` is set to 1.***
