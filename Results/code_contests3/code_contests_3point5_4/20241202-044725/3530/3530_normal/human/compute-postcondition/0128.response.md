According to the code, the loop will execute again if `mask` is less than `(1 << n)`. At the end of the last iteration, all `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3. Since the loop increments `mask` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `(1 << n)`.
State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be less than `(1 << n)`**
