Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and then `dp[i][mask]` is calculated as the remainder when divided by `MOD`.***
