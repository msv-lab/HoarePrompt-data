Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
