Output State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute. The loop has updated `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, and the final state reflects these changes.**
