Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since all `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, we can calculate the result. The value inside the brackets `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][1]`. The Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula.**
