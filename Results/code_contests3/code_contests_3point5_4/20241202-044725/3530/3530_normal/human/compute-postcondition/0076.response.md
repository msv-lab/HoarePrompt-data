According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, all `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the second time `j` should be incremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 2.

State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 2**
