According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` will be one more than the previous value. 
State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, a contains the mapped integer values from the input, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n`**
