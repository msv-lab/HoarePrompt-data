Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `j` is incremented by 2, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, `mask` has the `(j+2)`th bit set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `(j+2)`th bit set to 1.***
