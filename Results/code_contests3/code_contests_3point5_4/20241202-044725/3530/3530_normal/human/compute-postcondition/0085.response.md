Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD` of the current value. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1.
