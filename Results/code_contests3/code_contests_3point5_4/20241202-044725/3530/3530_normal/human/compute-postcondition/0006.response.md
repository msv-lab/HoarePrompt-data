Example Answer:
`a` is appended with the mapped integer values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The number of elements in the input determines the length of the appended list. The loop condition `_` is less than `n` indicates that the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, a contains the mapped integer values from the input, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, a contains the mapped integer values from the input, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n`**
