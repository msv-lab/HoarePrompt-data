Postcondition: ***`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is true. `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.***
