Output State: All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1, and `dp[3][mask]` is updated with the sum of the previous value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` if `a[2][j + 1]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `(j + 1)-th` bit set. The values of `dp[3][mask]` are all updated and then each `dp[3][mask]` value is taken modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated and then taken modulo `MOD`**
