Output State: **`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 2, the conditions for `a[i][j]` and `mask` are satisfied, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions and the value is taken modulo MOD. Additionally, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
