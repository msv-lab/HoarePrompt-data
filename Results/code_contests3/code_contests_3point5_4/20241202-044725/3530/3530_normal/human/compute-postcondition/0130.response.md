Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be less than `(1 << n)`, `j` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the jth bit set to 1***
