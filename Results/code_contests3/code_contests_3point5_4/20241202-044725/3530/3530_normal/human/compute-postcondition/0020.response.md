According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the condition `dp[0][i] is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N)` ensures that the loop will execute. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` should be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` should be initialized to 0.
State: **`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of i in the range (1 << N), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 1, mask is 1, `j` is 0**
