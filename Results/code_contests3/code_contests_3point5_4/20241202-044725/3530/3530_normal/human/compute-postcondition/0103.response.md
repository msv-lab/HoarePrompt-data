Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1, the value of `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is 1.**
