According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`. 

State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, a contains the mapped integer values from the input, for the loop to execute one more time `_` is less than `n`**
