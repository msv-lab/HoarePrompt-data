Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)` and not equal to `(1 << n)` for the loop to execute. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated and taken modulo `MOD`.***
