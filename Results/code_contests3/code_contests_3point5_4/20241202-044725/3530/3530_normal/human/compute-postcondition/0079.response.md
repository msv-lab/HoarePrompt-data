Postcondition: ***All `dp[i][mask]` values have been updated, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo MOD if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with 1 left-shifted by `j` is true.***
