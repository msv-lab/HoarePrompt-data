Postcondition: ***All `dp[3][mask]` values have been updated for all valid `j` values within the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `(1 << n)`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n` and `j` should be increased by 1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated with the new value if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j-th` bit set.***
