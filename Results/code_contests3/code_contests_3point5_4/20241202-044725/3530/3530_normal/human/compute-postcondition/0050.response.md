According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, so `mask` should be `mask + 1`. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` is `mask + 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
