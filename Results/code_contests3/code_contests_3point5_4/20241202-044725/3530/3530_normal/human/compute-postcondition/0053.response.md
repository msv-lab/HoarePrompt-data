Output State: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the provided formula for all valid `j` values within the loop. `mask` is now `mask + 1`. `n` is greater than 0. `a` is a 2D array. The element at index `(i - 1, j)` of `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` is not equal to 0. `dp[i][mask]` has been modified by taking its remainder when divided by `MOD`.
