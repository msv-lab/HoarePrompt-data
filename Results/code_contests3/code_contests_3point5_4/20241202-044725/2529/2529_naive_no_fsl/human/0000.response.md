Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input format specified in the problem description. The input is supposed to be in the form of arithmetic expressions, but the program is trying to read float values instead. This will lead to incorrect results as the program is not extracting the correct values from the input. 

Example:
Input:
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7

Expected Output:
1 2 2 1

Output from the program:
4 4 4 4

This example demonstrates that the program is not correctly processing the input as per the problem description.
