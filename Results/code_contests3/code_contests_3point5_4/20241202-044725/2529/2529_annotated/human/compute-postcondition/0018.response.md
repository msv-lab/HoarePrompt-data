Example Answer:
`my_list` appends the count of occurrences of the value `m-1` in `test_list`. The value of `i` is `m-1`, so the count of occurrences of `m-1` in `test_list` is calculated and appended to `my_list`. The value of `e` is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `i` is `m-1`, `e` is the last input float value, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of the value at index `m-1` in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `i` is `m-1`, `e` is the last input float value, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of the value at index `m-1` in `test_list`**
