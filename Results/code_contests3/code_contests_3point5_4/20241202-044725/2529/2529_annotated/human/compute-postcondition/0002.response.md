According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, test_list being empty does not affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
