Example Answer:
`e` is appended to the `test_list`, where `test_list` contains the float value `e`. The value of `m` representing the number of ships and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is the input float value appended to `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is the input float value appended to `test_list`**
