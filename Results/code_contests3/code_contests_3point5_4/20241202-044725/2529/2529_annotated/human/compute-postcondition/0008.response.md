According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is the input float value appended to `test_list`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `m` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.
State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 2, `e` is the input float value appended to `test_list` for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
