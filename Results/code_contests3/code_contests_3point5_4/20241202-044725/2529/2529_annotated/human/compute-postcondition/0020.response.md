Example Answer:
The code prints the count of occurrences of each unique value in `test_list` by joining them with a space separator. The `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of each unique value present in `test_list`. As the variables `m`, `test_list`, `i`, and `e` are not affected by the code snippet provided, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `i` is `m-1`, `e` is the last input float value, and the count of occurrences of each unique value in `test_list` is printed.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `i` is `m-1`, `e` is the last input float value, and the count of occurrences of each unique value in `test_list` is printed**.
