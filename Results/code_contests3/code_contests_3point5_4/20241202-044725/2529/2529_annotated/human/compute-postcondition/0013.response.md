According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `test_list` is not empty. Since `test_list` contains `m` float values and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `m-1` indicates that the loop will start by iterating over the last element of `test_list`. `e` being the last input float value also indicates the loop will start by iterating over the last element of `test_list`. `my_list` being an empty list does not impact the loop execution. 
State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `i` is `m-1`, `e` is the last input float value, `my_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute `test_list` is not empty**
