Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `m` representing the number of ships. It then prompts the user to input `m` float values, storing them in a list `test_list`. After that, it iterates through `test_list` to count the occurrences of each unique value and stores these counts in a list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of unique values in `test_list` separated by spaces.**
