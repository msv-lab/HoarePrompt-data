Example Answer:
`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts a float input and `float` converts it to a float. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is the input float value.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is the input float value**
