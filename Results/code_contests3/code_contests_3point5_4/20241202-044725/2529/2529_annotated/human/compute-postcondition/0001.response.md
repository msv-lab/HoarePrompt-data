Example Answer:
`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, but it is not directly affected by the initialization of `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, test_list is an empty list.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships, test_list is an empty list**
