According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 0. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1 less than `m`.
State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the number of ships, `test_list` contains the float value `e`, `i` is 1, `e` is a float input value**
