Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the value of `m` is dependent on the input provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships**
