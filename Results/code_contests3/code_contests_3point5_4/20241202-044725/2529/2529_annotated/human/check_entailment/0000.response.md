Correctness: **False**

The annotated program is incorrect because it is expecting float values as input, while the problem description clearly states that the jump coordinate expressions are of the form (a+b)/c where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. Therefore, the program should be modified to correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description.
