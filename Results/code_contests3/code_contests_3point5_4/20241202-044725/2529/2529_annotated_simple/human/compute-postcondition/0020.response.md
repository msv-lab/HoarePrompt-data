Example Answer:
The code prints the elements of my_list separated by spaces after converting them to strings. The values of my_list are determined by the count of occurrences of each value in test_list. The initial state shows that m is a positive integer, test_list contains m float values, and i is m. After running the code, the my_list values will be converted to strings and printed with spaces in between them.
Output State: **m is a positive integer, test_list contains m float values, i is m, my_list values are printed as strings separated by spaces**
