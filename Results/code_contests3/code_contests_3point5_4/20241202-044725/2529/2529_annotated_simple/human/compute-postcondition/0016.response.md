Example Answer:
`my_list` appends the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. Since `i` is initially equal to `m`, and `m` is a positive integer, the count of `m` in `test_list` is appended to `my_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, test_list contains at least 2 float values, `i` is `m`, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `m` in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, test_list contains at least 2 float values, `i` is `m`, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `m` in `test_list`**
