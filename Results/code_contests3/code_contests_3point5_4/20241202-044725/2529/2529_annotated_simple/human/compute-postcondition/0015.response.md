According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `test_list` and `i`. If there are more elements in `test_list` and `i` is less than the length of `test_list`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains at least 1 float value, `i` is `m-1`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `m` should still be a positive integer, `test_list` should contain at least 2 float values (since at least 1 float value was required initially), and `i` should be `m`.

State: **m is a positive integer, test_list contains at least 2 float values, i is m**
