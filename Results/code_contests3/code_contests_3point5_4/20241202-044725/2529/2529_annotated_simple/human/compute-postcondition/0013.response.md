According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_list. If the list has at least 1 float value, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, i is m-1, so it indicates the last index of the test_list. To execute the loop, my_list should have at least one element after the loop is completed. Therefore, for the loop to execute, test_list must contain at least 1 float value, i should be m-1 to start at the last index, and my_list should have at least 1 element after the loop.
State: **m is a positive integer, test_list contains at least 1 float value, i is m-1, my_list has at least 1 element after the loop**
