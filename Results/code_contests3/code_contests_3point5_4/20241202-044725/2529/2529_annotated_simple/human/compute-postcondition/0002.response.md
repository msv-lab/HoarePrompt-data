According to the code, the loop will execute as long as m is greater than 0. In this case, m is already stated as a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for m. However, since the `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be 0.
State: **m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
