Example Answer:
`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The variables `m`, `test_list`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer, test_list contains m input float values, i is m-1, my_list is an empty list.
Output State: **m is a positive integer, test_list contains m input float values, i is m-1, my_list is an empty list**
