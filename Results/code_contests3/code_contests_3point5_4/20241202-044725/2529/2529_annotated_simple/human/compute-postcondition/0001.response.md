Example Answer:
`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `m` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `test_list` is an empty list**
