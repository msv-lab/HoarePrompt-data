The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to calculate and return the coordinate of a jump based on the formula (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The parameter constraints specify that m is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The function will calculate the jump coordinate expression for each jump and return the result.
