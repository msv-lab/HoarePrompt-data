According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains the input float values, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should be less than `m`.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` contains the input float values, `i` is 2 for the loop to execute a third time**
