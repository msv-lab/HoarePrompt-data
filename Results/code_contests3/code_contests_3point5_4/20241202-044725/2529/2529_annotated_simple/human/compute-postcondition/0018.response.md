Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the count of occurrences of `m` in `test_list` to `my_list`. Since `i` is equal to `m`, the count of occurrences of `m` in `test_list` would be the same as the value of `m`. Therefore, after execution, the count of occurrences of `m` is appended to `my_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, test_list contains at least 3 float values, `i` is `m`, `my_list` contains the count of occurrences of `m` in `test_list`**
