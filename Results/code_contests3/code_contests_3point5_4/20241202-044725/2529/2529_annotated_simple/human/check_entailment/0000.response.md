Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. 

1. The program reads each jump coordinate as a float, while the problem description states that each jump coordinate is given as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c.
2. The program does not evaluate the arithmetic expression to obtain the actual coordinate value to compare with other ships' coordinates.
3. The program simply counts the occurrences of the input float values, which does not correspond to the number of ships ending up at the same coordinate.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct solution for the given problem.
