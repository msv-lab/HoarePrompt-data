Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately solve the given problem description. The program is expecting float input values, but the problem description clearly states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions. The program should handle parsing arithmetic expressions and then calculating the coordinates based on those expressions. Additionally, the program is only counting the occurrence of each coordinate in the list, but it should count how many ships will end up at the same coordinate after the jump. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
