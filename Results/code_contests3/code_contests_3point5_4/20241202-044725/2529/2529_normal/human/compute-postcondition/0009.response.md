Example Answer: 
`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a float. The value of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time**
