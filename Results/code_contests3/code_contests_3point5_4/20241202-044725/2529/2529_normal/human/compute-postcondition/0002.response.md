According to the code, the loop will execute if the value of `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
