Example Answer:
A new empty list `my_list` is created. The values of `m`, `test_list`, `i`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains all the values of `e` appended in each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to `m`, `e` is the last input floating-point number, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains all the values of `e` appended in each iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to `m`, `e` is the last input floating-point number, `my_list` is an empty list**
