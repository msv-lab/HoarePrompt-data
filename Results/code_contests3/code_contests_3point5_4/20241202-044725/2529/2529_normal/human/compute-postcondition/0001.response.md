No variables are affected by the code snippet, as an empty list `test_list` is initialized. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list**
