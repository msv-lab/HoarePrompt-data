Example Answer:
`my_list` is updated with the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The value of `i` is the next value in `test_list`, so `my_list` will contain the count of `i` in `test_list`. The loop will execute one more time as there are more items left in `test_list`.
Output State: **`m` is equal to the next value in `test_list`, `i` is equal to the next value in `test_list`, `my_list` is updated with the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` for the next iteration for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more items left in `test_list`**
