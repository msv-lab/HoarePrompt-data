The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function generates jump coordinates based on the given constraints. Each jump coordinate expression follows the format (a+b)/c where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function should output the jump coordinates based on the constraints provided. 
Functionality: **The function generates jump coordinates based on the given constraints of positive integers up to two decimal digits.**
