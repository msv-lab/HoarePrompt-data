According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `test_list` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `test_list` needs to have at least one value. Additionally, since `i` is equal to `m`, `m` must be equal to the first value in `test_list`. At the end of the loop, `e` will be the last input floating-point number, so for the loop to execute the first time, `e` should be the last value in `test_list`. Finally, `my_list` is an empty list before the loop starts.
State: **`m` is equal to the first value in `test_list`, `test_list` is not empty, `e` is the last value in `test_list`, `i` is equal to `m`, `my_list` is an empty list for the loop to execute the first time**
