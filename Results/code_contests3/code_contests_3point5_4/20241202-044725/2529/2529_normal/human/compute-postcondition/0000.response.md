Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `m` can be any positive integer less than or equal to 200,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 200,000.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer less than or equal to 200,000**
