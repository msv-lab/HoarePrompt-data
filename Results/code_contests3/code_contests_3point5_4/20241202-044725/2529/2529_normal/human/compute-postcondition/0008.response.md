According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 which becomes 3 and `m` should be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains the value of `e`, `i` is 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time**
