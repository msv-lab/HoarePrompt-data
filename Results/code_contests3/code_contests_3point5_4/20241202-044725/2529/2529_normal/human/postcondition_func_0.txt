The function reads a positive integer `m`, then reads `m` floating-point numbers and stores them in a list `test_list`. It then counts the occurrences of each element in `test_list` and stores the counts in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts as space-separated values. The function generates jump coordinates based on the given constraints of positive integers up to two decimal digits.
