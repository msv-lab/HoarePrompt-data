Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description specifies that the jump coordinate is given as an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, with constraints on the range of positive integers allowed. However, the code reads floating-point numbers instead of arithmetic expressions. This means that the code does not accurately represent the problem and will not give the correct output for the given input.
