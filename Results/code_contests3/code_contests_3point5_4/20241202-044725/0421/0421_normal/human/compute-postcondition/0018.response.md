Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` for the last elements is less than 2, then the flag remains False. If the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2 for any pair of elements, the flag is set to True.**
