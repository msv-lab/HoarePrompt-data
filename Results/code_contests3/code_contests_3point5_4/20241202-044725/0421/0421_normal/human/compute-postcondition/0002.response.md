Example Answer:
`nums` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), flag is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), flag is True**
