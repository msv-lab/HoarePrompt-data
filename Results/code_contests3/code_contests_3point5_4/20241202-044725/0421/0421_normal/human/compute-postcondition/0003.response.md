According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables flag and nums. If flag is True and nums is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers, and flag is True. In this case, for the loop to execute the first time, the list ai must not be empty. 
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time flag is True and ai is not empty**
