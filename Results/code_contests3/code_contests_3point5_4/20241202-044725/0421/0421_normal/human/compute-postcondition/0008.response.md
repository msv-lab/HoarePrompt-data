Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
