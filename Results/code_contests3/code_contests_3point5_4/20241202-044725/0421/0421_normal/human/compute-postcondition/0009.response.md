According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must not be greater than or equal to 2. So the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
