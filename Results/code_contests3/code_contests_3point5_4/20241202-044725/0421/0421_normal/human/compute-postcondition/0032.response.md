Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1 for the loop to execute another time. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then flag is set to False and the loop breaks out.***
