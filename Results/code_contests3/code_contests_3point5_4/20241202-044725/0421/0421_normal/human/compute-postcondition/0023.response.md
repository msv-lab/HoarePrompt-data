Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `nums` is empty, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 2 for the loop to execute again. The absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
