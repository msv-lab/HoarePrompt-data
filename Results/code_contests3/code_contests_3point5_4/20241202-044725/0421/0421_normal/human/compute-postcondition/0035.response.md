According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must be less than 2 for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1 for the loop to execute another time**
