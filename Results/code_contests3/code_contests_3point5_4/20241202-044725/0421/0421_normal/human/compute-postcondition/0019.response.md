According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False and `nums` has at least 2 elements. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `flag` needs to be True or `nums` needs to be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 2 for the loop to execute again either `flag` is True or `nums` is empty**
