Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The variable `ai` and its contents are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
