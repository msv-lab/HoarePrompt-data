According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is len(nums) - 2, which means the loop will execute again. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `flag` is True or `nums` is empty for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or `nums` is empty, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 2 for the loop to execute again**
