Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. After the execution, if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
