According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable i is less than len(nums) - 1. The loop relies on the length of the nums list. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the variables need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1 for the loop to execute another time**
