Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for a positive integer `n` and a list `ai` of integers. It then iterates through the list checking if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If such a difference is found, the function sets `flag` to False; otherwise, it remains True. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `flag` is True, indicating all differences are less than 2, and 'NO' if `flag` is False.**
