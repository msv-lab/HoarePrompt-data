According to the code, whether the loop can execute another time depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] must be less than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1 for the loop to execute another time, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2**
