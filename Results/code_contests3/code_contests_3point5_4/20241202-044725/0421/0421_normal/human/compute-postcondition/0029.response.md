According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1. 

To execute the loop another time, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] should still be less than 2. Therefore, no changes need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is True or False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements where the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is less than 2, `i` is len(nums) - 1 for the loop to execute another time**
