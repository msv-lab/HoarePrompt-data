According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of integers between 1 and 100, `flag` is False, `ai` is not empty, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2**
