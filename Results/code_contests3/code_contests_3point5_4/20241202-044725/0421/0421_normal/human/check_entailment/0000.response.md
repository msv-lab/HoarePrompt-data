Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The output hints agree with the code. The function iterates through the list checking if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If such a difference is found, the function sets `flag` to False; otherwise, it remains True. Finally, the function prints 'YES' if `flag` is True, indicating all differences are less than 2, and 'NO' if `flag` is False.

However, the code fails to consider the case when there are multiple stacks of maximal height and the leftmost one should be chosen. The code only removes the stack with maximum height without considering its position in the row. This can lead to incorrect sorting in cases where the leftmost stack should be chosen but is not.
