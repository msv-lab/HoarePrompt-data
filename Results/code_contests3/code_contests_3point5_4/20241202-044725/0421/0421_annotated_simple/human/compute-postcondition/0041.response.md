According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `i < len(nums) - 1` still needs to be satisfied.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums` minus 1**
