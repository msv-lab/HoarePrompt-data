Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2, `nums` has a length of 0, `i` is len(nums) - 2. The code prints 'YES' if flag is True and 'NO' if flag is False.**
