According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If nums is not empty, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, and flag is True does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty, i is 0**
