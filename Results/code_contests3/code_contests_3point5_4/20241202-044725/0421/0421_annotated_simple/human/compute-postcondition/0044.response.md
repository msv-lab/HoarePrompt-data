Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` has a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
