According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables flag and nums. If flag is True and nums is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, flag can be either True or False, and nums has one less element after removal. So for the loop to execute one more time, flag needs to be True and nums should not be empty.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True, nums has one less element after removal for the loop to execute again**
