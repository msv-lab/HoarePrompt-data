Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` is unknown, so after execution, `flag` is `False`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 2**
