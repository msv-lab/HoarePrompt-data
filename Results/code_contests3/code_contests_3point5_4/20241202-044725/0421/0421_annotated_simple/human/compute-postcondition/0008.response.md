Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False. For the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty, i is 0. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, flag is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
