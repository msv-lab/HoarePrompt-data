Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty. The loop will iterate through the entire nums list, checking if the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements is greater than or equal to 2. If any pair satisfies this condition, flag will be set to False. Otherwise, flag will remain True after all iterations of the loop.**
