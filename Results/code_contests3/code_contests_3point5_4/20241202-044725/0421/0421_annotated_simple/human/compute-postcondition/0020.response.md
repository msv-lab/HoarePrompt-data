According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If nums has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n being a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and flag is True.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums has at least 2 elements, i is 0**
