According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `i` is 1. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should not be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, i is 2, the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is not greater than or equal to 2**
