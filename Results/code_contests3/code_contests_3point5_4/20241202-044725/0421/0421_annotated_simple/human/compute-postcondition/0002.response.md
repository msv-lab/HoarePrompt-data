The `nums` variable is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input. Since the initial state mentions `n` as a positive integer, `ai` as a list of `n` positive integers, and `flag` as True, these variables are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is True**
