Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. The variable `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and after removing the maximum element, the length of `nums` will decrease by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2, `nums` has a length of at least 1, and `i` is len(nums) - 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of n positive integers, `flag` is False if there exists a pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2, `nums` has a length of at least 1, and `i` is len(nums) - 2**
