Example Answer: 
`flag` is assigned the value False, so after execution, `flag` is False. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is False, nums is not empty, i is 1**
