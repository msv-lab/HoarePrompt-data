Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `ai`. It then iterates through the elements of `ai`, checking if there exists a pair of adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2. If such a pair is found, it sets the flag to False and stops the iteration. Finally, it prints 'YES' if no such pair is found, and 'NO' otherwise. However, the function lacks a return statement, so it does not explicitly return any value. **
