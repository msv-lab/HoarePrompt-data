Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input but does not convert it to an integer. The state of `ai` and other variables remain the same as the input did not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers**
