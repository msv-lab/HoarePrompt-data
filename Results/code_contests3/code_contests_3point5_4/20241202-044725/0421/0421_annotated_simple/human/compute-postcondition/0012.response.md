Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, ai is a list of n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, the loop or if statement will break. Otherwise, the program will continue its execution without any changes to the variables.***
