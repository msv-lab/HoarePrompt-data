Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program only checks if there are adjacent elements with a difference of at least 2, but it does not simulate the described algorithm of building stacks of ravioli and removing the tallest one while handling the sliding of ravioli from taller stacks onto shorter stacks. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the described procedure.
