Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input array and iterates through it to check if there are any adjacent elements that differ in height by two or more. If such elements are found, the flag is set to False, indicating that the array cannot be sorted using the described procedure. Otherwise, the program continues to remove the tallest stack and check for the condition until all stacks have been removed. Finally, it outputs "YES" if the array can be sorted and "NO" if it cannot.

The program logic aligns with the problem description and correctly determines whether the input array can be sorted using the described algorithm. It covers all potential cases where the algorithm might fail, making it correct.
