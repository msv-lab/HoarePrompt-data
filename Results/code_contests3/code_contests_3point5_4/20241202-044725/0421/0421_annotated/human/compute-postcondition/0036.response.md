According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. If the length is at least 2, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, at least one element is removed from `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `n` should be a string, `ai` should contain `n` positive integers, `flag` should be either True or False, and `nums` should still contain at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value.
State: **`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2**
