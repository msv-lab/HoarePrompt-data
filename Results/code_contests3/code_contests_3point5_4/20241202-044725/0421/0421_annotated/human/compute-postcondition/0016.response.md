Postcondition: ***`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False. If the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is met, the program continues normally. If the condition is not met, then `flag` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
