According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n being a string does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` contains at least 2 elements. 
State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is either True or False, for the loop to execute again `nums` contains at least 2 elements**
