According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums` and the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2`. If the condition is not met, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` must not be met.
State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is either True or False, the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` is not met**
