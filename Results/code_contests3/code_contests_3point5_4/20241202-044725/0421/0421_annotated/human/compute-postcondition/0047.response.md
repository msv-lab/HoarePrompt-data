Output State: **`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements after removal of the maximum value, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 3, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
