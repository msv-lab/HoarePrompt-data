According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If the length of nums is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is False, nums contains at least 2 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, nums must contain at least 3 elements.
State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is False, nums contains at least 3 elements**
