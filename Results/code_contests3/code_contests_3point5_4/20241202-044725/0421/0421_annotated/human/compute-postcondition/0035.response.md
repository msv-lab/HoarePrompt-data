According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, and `nums` contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value. Since `flag` is already either True or False, it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must still contain at least 1 element after the removal of the maximum value.
State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value for the loop to execute again**
