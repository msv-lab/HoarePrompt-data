According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2. If the condition is not met, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is True, nums is not empty. Since there is no change in variables unless the condition is met, all variables remain the same for the next iteration to execute.
State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is True, nums is not empty.**
