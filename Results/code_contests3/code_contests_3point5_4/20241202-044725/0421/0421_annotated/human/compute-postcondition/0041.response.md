According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value, and for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` must be at least 2. Additionally, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the program to continue execution.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `nums` should be at least 3 after the removal of the maximum value, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should be greater than or equal to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements after removal of the maximum value, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 3 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**
