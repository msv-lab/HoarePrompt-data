Postcondition: ***n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is False, nums contains at least 3 elements, the absolute difference between all elements in nums must be less than 2 for the loop to execute another time. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i+1] is greater than or equal to 2, then the flag is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
