Postcondition: ***`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then the program will continue execution with the updated conditions.***
