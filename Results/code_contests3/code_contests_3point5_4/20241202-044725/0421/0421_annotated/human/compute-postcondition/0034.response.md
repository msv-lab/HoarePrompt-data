The `max` value in `nums` is removed, and the absolute difference between the remaining elements may change. If the absolute difference between all elements in `nums` is less than 2, `flag` remains False. Otherwise, `flag` is set to True. The initial state of variables `n`, `ai`, and `flag` remains the same.
Output State: **n is a string, ai contains n positive integers, flag is either True or False, nums contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value**
