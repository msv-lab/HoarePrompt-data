Postcondition: ***`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` contains at least 1 element after removal of the maximum value, and for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 2. Additionally, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.***
