According to the code, the loop can execute again if the length of `nums` is at least 3 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, and `nums` contains at least 2 elements after removal of the maximum value. 

To execute the loop one more time, the length of `nums` should be at least 3 and the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` should be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, `i` should be less than the length of `nums` - 1.

State: **`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements after removal of the maximum value, for the loop to execute again the length of `nums` is at least 3, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1**
