Postcondition: ***`n` is a string, `ai` contains `n` positive integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements after removal of the maximum value. For the loop to execute again, the length of `nums` is at least 3 and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.***
