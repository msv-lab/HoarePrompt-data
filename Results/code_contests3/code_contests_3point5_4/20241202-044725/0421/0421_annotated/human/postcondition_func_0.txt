The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`. It then iterates through the list checking if the absolute difference between consecutive elements is less than 2. If it finds a difference greater than or equal to 2, it sets the `flag` to False and stops the iteration. It then removes the maximum value from `nums`. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `flag` is True, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not explicitly return a value.
