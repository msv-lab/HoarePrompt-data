Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle a case where two adjacent stacks of ravioli differ in height by two or more. For example, consider the input:

Input:
3
3 1 2

The algorithm should output "NO" because the ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, which violates the sorting rule. However, the program will output "YES" in this case, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
