Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `a` after the current `i`. If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], and `a` is 'tstr123' and `i` is 's', 'YES' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
