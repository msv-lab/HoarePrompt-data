According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `a` and the value of `i`. If `i` is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', and `a` is 'tstr123', the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `a`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be the next character in `a` after the current `i`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `a` after the current `i`**
