Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints out 'YES' to the console. The variables `a` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `a` after the current `i` for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `a` after the current `i` for the loop to execute another time**
