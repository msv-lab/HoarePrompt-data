According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `a`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `a` is not an empty input. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `a` needs to be a non-empty input.
State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is a non-empty input**
