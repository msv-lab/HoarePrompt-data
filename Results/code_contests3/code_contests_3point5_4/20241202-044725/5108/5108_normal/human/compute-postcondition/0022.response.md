Functionality: **The function reads an input string 'p' and checks if it contains the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are present, it prints 'YES' and assigns 'tstr123' to the variable 'a'. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
