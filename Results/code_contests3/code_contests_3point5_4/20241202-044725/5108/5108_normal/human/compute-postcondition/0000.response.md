Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input from the user and stores it in `a`. The initial state mentions that `p` is a string, so that is unrelated to the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` contains the input provided by the user.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` contains the input provided by the user**
