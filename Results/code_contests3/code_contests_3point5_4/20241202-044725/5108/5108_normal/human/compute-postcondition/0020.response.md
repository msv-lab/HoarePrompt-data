Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126, inclusive; `a` is either 'tstr123' if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is in the input provided by the user, or it remains the same as the user input if 'H', 'Q', or '9' is not present. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', then the program executes the if part.***
