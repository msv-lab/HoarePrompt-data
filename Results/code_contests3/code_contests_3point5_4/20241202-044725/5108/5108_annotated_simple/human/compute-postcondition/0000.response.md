Example Answer:
The program takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The value of `a` is determined by the user input, so it can be any valid character from the HQ9+ programming language. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains the character input by the user.
Output State: **`a` contains the character input by the user**
