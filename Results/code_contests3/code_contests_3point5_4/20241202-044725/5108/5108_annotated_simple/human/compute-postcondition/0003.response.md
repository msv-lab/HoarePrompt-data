Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'YES' to the console and does not affect the variables `a` and 'i'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains the character input by the user, `a` is not empty. The character 'i' is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'.
Output State: **`a` contains the character input by the user, `a` is not empty. The character 'i' is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'**
