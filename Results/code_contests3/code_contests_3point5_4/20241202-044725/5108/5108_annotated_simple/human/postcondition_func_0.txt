The function `func` reads a string input from the user and checks if it contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If it does, it prints 'YES' and assigns a specific value to the input string. If the input string does not contain any of these characters, it prints 'NO'. The function does not have any specific return value. However, there is missing functionality in the annotations as it does not cover the case where the input string does not contain any of the specified characters and is equal to 'tstr123' after processing.
