Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input and checks each character if it is one of the specified instructions ('H', 'Q', '9'). 
- If any of these instructions are found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. 
- If none of the instructions are found, it prints 'NO'. 
- This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 
- Therefore, the program is correct.
