Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description. It takes the input of a positive integer N and a string S of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string S. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0. Finally, it prints the final result. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The logic is straightforward and the code works correctly for all possible inputs.
