Example Answer:
The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute one more time N must be greater than the current value of i; result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute one more time N must be greater than the current value of i; result is incremented by 1**
