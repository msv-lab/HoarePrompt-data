Functionality: **The function accepts user input for a positive integer N and a string S of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string S. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0. Finally, it prints the final result. The function essentially counts the occurrences of 'I' and 'D' in the string S and adjusts the result accordingly.**
