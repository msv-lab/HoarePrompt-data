Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. If the difference between the number of 'D's and 'I's is greater than 0, then the function returns the negative difference between the number of 'D's and 'I's. If the difference is less than 0, then the function returns the difference between the number of 'I's and 'D's. If the difference is 0, the function returns 0.***
