The value of `S` is updated to the input received from the user. The length of `S` is N, and it contains only the characters 'I' and 'D'. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'**
