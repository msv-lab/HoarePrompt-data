Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. The value of result will depend on the number of 'I's and 'D's in the string S. If there are more 'I's than 'D's, result will be the difference between the number of 'I's and 'D's. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, result will be the negative difference between the number of 'D's and 'I's. If the number of 'I's is equal to the number of 'D's, result will be 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition (result < 0), the overall state of the program is that the difference between the number of 'D's and 'I's is greater than 0.***
