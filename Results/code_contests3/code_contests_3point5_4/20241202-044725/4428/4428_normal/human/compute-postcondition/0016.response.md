Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute one more time N must be greater than the current value of i. If S[i] == 'I', then the result is incremented by 1. If S[i] == 'D', then the result is decreased by 1.***
