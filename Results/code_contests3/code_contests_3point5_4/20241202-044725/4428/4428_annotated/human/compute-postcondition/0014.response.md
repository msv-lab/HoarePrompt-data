Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, so after execution, `result` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D' with S[1] = 'I' for the loop to execute a second time; `result` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D' with S[1] = 'I' for the loop to execute a second time; `result` is incremented by 1**
