Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D', result is either 1 or -1, for the loop to execute the first time N is greater than 0, i is 0. If S[i] is equal to 'I', then result is updated to 1. If S[i] is not equal to 'I' for the current loop iteration, then result is updated to -1.***
