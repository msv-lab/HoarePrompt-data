Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I' and 'D' in the string `S` and prints the result. If the calculated result is negative, it updates the result to 0 before printing. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on the input constraints for `N` and `S`.**
