Example Answer:
N is assigned the value of int(raw_input()), where raw_input() accepts an input and int() converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions N is a positive integer, after execution, N will be a positive integer. The variable S is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D'**
