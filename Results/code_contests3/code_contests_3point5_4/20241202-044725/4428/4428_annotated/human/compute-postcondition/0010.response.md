Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `result` was 1, after execution it will be 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D', result is 2, for the loop to execute a second time i is 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D', result is 2, for the loop to execute a second time i is 1**
