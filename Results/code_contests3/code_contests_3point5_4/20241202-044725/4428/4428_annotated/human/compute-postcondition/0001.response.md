Example Answer:
`S` is reassigned the value of `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. The values of `N` and the content of `S` are not specified, so the output state is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D'.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D'**
