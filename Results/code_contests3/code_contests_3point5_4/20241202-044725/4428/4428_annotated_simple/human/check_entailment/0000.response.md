Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find the maximum value taken by x during the operations as described in the problem description. The program simply calculates the final value of x based on the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string S, but it does not keep track of the maximum value of x during the operations. 

The program should be modified to keep track of the maximum value of x reached during the operations, and update it accordingly.
