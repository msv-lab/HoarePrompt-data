Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The value of `result` is dependent on the characters in string `S`. If the character at index i+1 in string S is 'I', then the result is incremented by 1. If not, the result is decremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the character at index i+2 in string S must be 'I', the result will always be incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', the character at index i+2 in string S must be 'I'. If S[i+1] == 'I', the result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', the character at index i+2 in string S must be 'I'. If S[i+1] == 'I', the result is incremented by 1**
