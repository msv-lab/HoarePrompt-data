Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute again, the character at index i+1 in string S must be 'I'; `result` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute again, the character at index i+1 in string S must be 'I'; `result` is decremented by 1**
