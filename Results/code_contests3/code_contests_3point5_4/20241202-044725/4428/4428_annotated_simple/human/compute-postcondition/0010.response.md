Example Answer:
The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute again, the character at index i+1 in string S must be 'I'; result is incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', for the loop to execute again, the character at index i+1 in string S must be 'I'; result is incremented by 1**
