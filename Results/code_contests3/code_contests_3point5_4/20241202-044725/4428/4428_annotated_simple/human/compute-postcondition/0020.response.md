Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D'. If there are more 'I's than 'D's in the string S, the result will be the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's. If there are more 'D's than 'I's, the result will be the negative difference between the count of 'D's and 'I's. If the count of 'I's and 'D's is equal, the result will be 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if the result is less than 0, the result is set to 0.***
