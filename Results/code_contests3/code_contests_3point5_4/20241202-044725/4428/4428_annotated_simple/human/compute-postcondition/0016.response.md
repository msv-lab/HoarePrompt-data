Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only characters 'I' and 'D', the character at index i+2 in string S must be 'I'. If S[i+1] == 'I', the result is incremented by 1. If S[i+1] != 'I', the result is decremented by 1. The final result depends on the conditions specified in the if and else parts of the program fragment.***
