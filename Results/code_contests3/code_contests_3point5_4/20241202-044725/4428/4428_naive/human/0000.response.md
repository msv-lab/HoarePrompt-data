Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description by iterating through the string `S` and incrementing or decrementing the `result` variable based on the character at that position. The code then checks if the final result is negative and sets it to 0 if so. The maximum value taken by `x` during the operations is accurately calculated and printed. The code handles all potential cases where the input string consists of only characters `I` and `D`, making it correct.
