Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It increments the value of x by 1 if S_i='I' and decrements the value of x by 1 if S_i='D'. It then correctly calculates and prints the maximum value taken by x during the operations. The constraints are also satisfied, and the output matches the expected output for the given examples.
