Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is less than `k`. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to the new value of `a - (b + 1) * v` after the operation and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decremented by `v`.***
