Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply: If `b >= k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and the loop continues if `a` remains greater than 0. If `b < k`, the loop executes as long as `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is less than `k`. When `b > 0`, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b <= 0`, `a` is decremented by `v` after the operation.***
