Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decremented by `v`. Since `a` is assigned input integer values, the new value of `a` will be the previous value minus `v`. The loop will execute again if `a` is greater than 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0**
