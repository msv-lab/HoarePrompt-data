Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - k * v`. The previous values of `a`, `k`, and `v` are known as input integers. The value of `a` will be updated based on the subtraction. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0; `a` is updated based on the subtraction operation.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0; `a` is updated based on the subtraction operation**
