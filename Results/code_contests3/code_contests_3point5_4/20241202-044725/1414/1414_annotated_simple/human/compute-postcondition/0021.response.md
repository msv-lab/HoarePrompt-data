Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a - v`, where `a`, `b`, `v` are input integers. The value of `a` changes based on the input values of `a` and `v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is 2, for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0, `a` is updated based on the input values.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is 2, for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0, `a` is updated based on the input values**
