Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are input integers, `res` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `a` must be greater than 0. If `b >= k`, `a` is updated to `a - (k - 1)` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. If `b < k`, `a` remains the same as the input value and `b` is set to 0.***
