Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0; `a` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0; `a` is updated based on the calculation, `b` is 0**
