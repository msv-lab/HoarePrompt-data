Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `b` minus `k - 1`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are known, so after execution, the new value of `b` will be `b - (k - 1)`. 
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are assigned input integer values, `res` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 0; `a` is updated based on the subtraction operation, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`**
