The function `func` reads input integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` from the user, where 2 <= k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. It then iterates a while loop based on the value of `a`, incrementing `res` each time. Within the loop, it updates the values of `a` and `b` based on certain conditions involving `k` and `v`. After the loop, it prints the final value of `res`. The function does not have a return value.
