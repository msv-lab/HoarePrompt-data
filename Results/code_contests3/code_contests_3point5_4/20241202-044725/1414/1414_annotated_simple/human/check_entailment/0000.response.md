Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It determines the minimum number of boxes required to distribute all the nuts based on the conditions given. The program iterates through the nuts, decrementing the number of nuts in each iteration based on the number of sections and divisors available. It keeps track of the number of boxes used and prints the result at the end.

The program handles the cases where the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section of the box are within the specified constraints. It ensures that the number of boxes used is minimized while meeting the conditions provided in the problem description.
