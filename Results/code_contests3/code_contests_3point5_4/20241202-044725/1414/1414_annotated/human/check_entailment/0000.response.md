Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, and then uses a loop to calculate the minimum number of boxes needed to put all the nuts. The conditions inside the loop ensure that the number of divisors and the capacity of each section are taken into account properly. The final result is printed as the minimum number of boxes required. The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description.
