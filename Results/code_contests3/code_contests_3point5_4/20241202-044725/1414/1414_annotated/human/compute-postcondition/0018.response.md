Example Answer:
`b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1` from its previous value. The variables `k`, `a`, and `v` remain unchanged. Also, `res` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `a` is updated to a new value after subtracting `k * v` from its previous value; `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged; `a` is updated to a new value after subtracting `k * v` from its previous value; `res` is increased by 1**
