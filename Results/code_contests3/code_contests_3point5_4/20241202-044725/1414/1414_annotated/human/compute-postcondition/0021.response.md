Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a - v`, where `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. The value of `a` is decreased by `v`, but the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `v` are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1**
