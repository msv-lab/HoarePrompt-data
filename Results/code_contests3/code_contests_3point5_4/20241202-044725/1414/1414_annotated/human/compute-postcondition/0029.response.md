Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned as 0. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0**
