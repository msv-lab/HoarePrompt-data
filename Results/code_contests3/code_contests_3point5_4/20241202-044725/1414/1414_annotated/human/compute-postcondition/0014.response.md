Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0. If b >= k, the new value of `a` is calculated based on the previous value, `k`, and `v`; `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`. If b < k, `a` is updated to the new value after subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from its previous value and `b` is set to 0.***
