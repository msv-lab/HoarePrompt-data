Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `b - (k - 1)`. Since `k` is between 2 and 1000 and `b` is between 1 and 1000, the value of `b` changes accordingly. The value of `res` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1**
