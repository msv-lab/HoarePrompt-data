According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `a` is greater than 0. Right before the loop, `a` is an integer with a lower bound of 1, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0**
