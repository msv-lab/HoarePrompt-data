Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0. If b > 0, `a` is updated to the new value after subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from its previous value and `b` is 0. If b <= 0, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.***
