Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is increased by 1. If b >= k, `res` is increased by 1. If b > 0, `res` is increased by 1 and `b` is updated to 0. If b <= 0, `res` is increased by 1 and `a` is updated based on the subtraction operation.***
