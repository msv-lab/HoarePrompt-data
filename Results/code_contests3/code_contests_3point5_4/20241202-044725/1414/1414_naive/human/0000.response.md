Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum number of boxes needed to store all the nuts based on the given constraints. It iterates through the nuts and updates the number of boxes accordingly, considering the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section of the box. The logic provided in the program aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
