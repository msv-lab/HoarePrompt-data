Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 1**
