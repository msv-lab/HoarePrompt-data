Functionality: The function `func` reads input values for `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, where `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers satisfying 2 <= k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000. It then enters a loop where it iterates and updates `a` and `b` based on certain conditions until `a` becomes less than or equal to 0. The number of iterations is stored in `res` and then printed. The function does not have a return value specified.
