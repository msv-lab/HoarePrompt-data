Example Answer:
The value of `res` is incremented by 1. As `res` was initially 1, after execution it becomes 2. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 2**
