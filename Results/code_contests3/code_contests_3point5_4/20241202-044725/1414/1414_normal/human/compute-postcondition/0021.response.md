Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decremented by `v`, where `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers. Since the initial state of `a` is unknown, the new value of `a` cannot be determined exactly. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 2**
