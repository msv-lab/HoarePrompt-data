Example Answer:
Initially, the value of `b` is subtracted by the value of `k - 1`. The previous values of `b` and `k` are unknown, so the new value of `b` will depend on the initial values of `b` and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `b`, `v` remain the same; `a` has been updated to a new integer value based on the initial values, and `b` is updated based on the initial values of `k` and `b`.
Output State: **`k`, `b`, `v` remain the same; `a` has been updated to a new integer value based on the initial values, and `b` is updated based on the initial values of `k` and `b`**
