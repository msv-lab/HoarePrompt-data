Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 1. `b` is less than `k`. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated to the value of `a` minus the product of `(b + 1)` and `v` and `b` becomes 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
