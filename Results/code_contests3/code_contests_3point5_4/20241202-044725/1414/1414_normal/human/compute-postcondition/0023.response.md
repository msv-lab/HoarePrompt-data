Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 2. If b >= k, then `b` is updated by subtracting a value between 1 and 999. If b > 0 in the else part, then `a` is updated and `b` is set to 0. If b <= 0 in the else part, `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` remain unchanged.***
