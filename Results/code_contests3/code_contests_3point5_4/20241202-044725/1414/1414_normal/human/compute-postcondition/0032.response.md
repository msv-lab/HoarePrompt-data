Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000; `res` is 3, for the loop to execute again `a` is currently greater than 0. If b >= k, `k`, `b`, `v` remain the same; `a` is updated based on the initial values. If b > 0, then `a` is updated to a - (b + 1) * v, `b` is set to 0. If b <= 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
