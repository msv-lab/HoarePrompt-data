Correctness: **False**

The given code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. 

One example where the code does not work correctly is when the number of nuts in the input is greater than the product of the number of divisors and the capacity of each section of the box. In this case, the code will not calculate the minimum number of boxes required correctly.

For example, consider the input:
3 10 3 3

The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the code will output 3.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all cases as per the problem description.
