The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, all of which are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 104. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points and calculate the Euclidean distance between them. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing two points and returns the Euclidean distance between them.**
