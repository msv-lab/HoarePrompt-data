Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points and returns the Euclidean distance between these points. The function calculates the distance using the formula sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2). The function accurately computes the Euclidean distance between the points without any missing functionality or edge cases.**
