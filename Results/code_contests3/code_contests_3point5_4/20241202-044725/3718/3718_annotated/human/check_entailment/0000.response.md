Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not find the minimum detection radius as required by the problem description. The program only calculates the Euclidean distance between two points, but it does not implement the logic to find the minimum radius for the radar as described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
