Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and calculates the Euclidean distance between these two points using the distance formula. **

The code does what the annotation states, which is to return the Euclidean distance between the given points. However, there is a missing point that the code does not handle potential edge cases such as when the input coordinates are not within the specified range (-10000 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10000). It would be beneficial to include input validation to handle out-of-range coordinates in the functionality summary.
