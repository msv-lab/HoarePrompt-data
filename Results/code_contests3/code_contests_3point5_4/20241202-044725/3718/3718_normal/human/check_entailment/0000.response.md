Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar as described in the problem. The program takes two sets of input representing the coordinates of two points and the distance of one point from the other. It then calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points and determines the minimum radius for the radar based on the given conditions.

The output is formatted as a single real number with a precision of six decimal places, which matches the expected output format. The mathematical operations performed in the code align with the problem description, and the logic for calculating the minimum detection radius is correctly implemented. 

After reviewing the code and the problem description, I could not find any case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
