Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This function is in line with the problem description, as it is used to calculate the distance between the city and the flatland ring in order to determine the minimum detection radius for the radar. The program always returns the correct Euclidean distance, which is a crucial step in solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
