The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, all of which are integers within the range -10000 to 10000. The function calculates the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns the result as a floating-point number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing coordinates of two points, calculate the Euclidean distance between them, and return the result as a floating-point number. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters representing coordinates of two points and returns the Euclidean distance between them as a floating-point number.**
