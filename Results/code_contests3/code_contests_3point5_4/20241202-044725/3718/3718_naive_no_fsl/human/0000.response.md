Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the input of city coordinates and flatland ring distances. It considers all possible cases where the radar can be placed in order to detect enemy movements. The formula used to calculate the minimum detection radius is sound and provides the correct output. The program also handles the cases where the city and flatland ring are close to each other or far apart. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
