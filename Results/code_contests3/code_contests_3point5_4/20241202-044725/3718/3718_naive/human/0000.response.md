Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two sets of coordinates and radii as input, calculates the distance between the two cities, and then calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the given conditions. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it follows the problem description and computes the minimum detection radius accurately. It considers all possible scenarios where the radar needs to be placed and calculates the radius accordingly. There are no edge cases identified where the program fails to provide the correct output.
