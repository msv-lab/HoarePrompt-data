Example Answer:
The values in the list `p` are subtracted by 1 and assigned to the list `b` using the `map` function. The values in the list `p` are already input integers subtracted by 1, so `b` will contain the input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers**
