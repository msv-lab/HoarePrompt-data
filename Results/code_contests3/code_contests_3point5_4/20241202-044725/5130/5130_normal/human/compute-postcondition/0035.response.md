Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing n elements, `b` is a list containing n elements, `comps` is a list of n 0s, `col` is 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `j` is equal to the last index accessed in list `p`. If `comps[i]` is 0, then all elements in list `comps` contain the value `col`, and all elements in `comps` are 1. Additionally, `j` is the last index accessed in list `p`.***
