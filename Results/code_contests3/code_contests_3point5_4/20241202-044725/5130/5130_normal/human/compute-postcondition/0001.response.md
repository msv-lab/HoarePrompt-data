Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each element of the input split by spaces. The input comes from `raw_input().split()`, and each element is converted to an integer. The initial state `n` is used indirectly through the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1**
