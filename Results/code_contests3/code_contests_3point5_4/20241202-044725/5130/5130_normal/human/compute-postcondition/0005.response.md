According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the conditions to adjust are: 
- p should be a list containing n elements
- b should be a list containing n elements
- comps should be a list of n 0s
- col should be 0
- i should be 0

State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing n elements, `b` is a list containing n elements, `comps` is a list of n 0s, `col` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
