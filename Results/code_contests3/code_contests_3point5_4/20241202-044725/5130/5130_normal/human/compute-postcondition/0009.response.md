Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. Therefore, after execution, `j` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing n elements, `b` is a list containing n elements, `comps` is a list of n elements with the element at index `i` set to 1, `col` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 0**
