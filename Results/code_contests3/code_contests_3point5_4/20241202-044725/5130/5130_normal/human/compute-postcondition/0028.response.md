According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. If this condition is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[i]` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` should be set to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing n elements, `b` is a list containing n elements, `comps` is a list of n elements with all 0s except for `comps[i]` which is now 1, `col` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to the value at index `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be 0**
