According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `comps` is a list of n elements with all 0s except for `comps[i]` which is now `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is equal to the last index accessed in list `p`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be changed from 0 to something other than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list containing n elements, `b` is a list containing n elements, `comps` is a list of n elements with all 0s except for `comps[i]` which is now `col`, `col` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the last index accessed in list `p`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` needs to be something other than 0**
