Example Answer: 
`col` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the variables `n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers; `comps` is a list of n 0s; `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers; `comps` is a list of n 0s; `col` is 0**
