Example Answer:
The list `comps` is initialized with `n` number of 0s using list comprehension. The value of `n` is already given as an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers; `comps` is a list of n 0s.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list containing the input integers subtracted by 1; `b` is a list containing the input integers; `comps` is a list of n 0s**
