The function `func` reads input and processes it to determine the number of connected components in a graph represented by the input. It then prints either 0 if there is only one connected component or the number of connected components in the graph. Additionally, it increments the output by 1 if the sum of elements in list `b` is 0. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the output based on the processed input data.
