Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code calculates the number of connected components in a graph based on the input permutations `p` and `b`. However, it does not correctly determine the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the permutation `p` and the sequence `b` so that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

The output hints do not align with the problem description as well. The code computes the number of connected components in the graph and increments the output by 1 if the sum of elements in list `b` is 0. This logic does not match the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the code provided, the correctness is **False**.
