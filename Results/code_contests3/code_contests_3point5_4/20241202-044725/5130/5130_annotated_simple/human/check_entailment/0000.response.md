Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. It does this by calculating the number of connected components in the permutation graph and adding 1 if the sum of the sequence b is 0. This approach follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
