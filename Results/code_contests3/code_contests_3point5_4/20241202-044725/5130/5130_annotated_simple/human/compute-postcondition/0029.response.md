Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]] == 0` should be true, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
