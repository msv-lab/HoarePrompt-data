Example Answer:
The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. The previous values of `j`, `p`, and `comps` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, `comps[p[j]]` is assigned the value of 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, `comps[p[j]]` is assigned the value of 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
