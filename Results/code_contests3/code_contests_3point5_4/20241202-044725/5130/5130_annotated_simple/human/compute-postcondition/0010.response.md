According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros and the element at index `i` in `comps` is equal to 1, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the element at index `p[j]` in `comps` needs to be equal to 0, and `j` must be valid index in the list `p`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, the element at index p[j] in comps is equal to 1, j is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the element at index p[j] in comps needs to be equal to 0 and j is a valid index in p**
