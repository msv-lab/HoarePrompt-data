Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is updated to a value such that `comps[p[j]] == 0` is false, indicating all elements in `comps` have been assigned `col` if `comps[i] == 0`. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the program.***
