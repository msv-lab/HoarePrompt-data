Output State: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where the element at index p[j] is equal to `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is a valid index in p, `j` is updated to the value at index j in list `p`, and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0, `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, `j` is updated to the value at index j in list `p`.
