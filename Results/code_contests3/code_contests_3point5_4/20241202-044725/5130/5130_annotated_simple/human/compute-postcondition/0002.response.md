Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to the input obtained by splitting the raw input. The variable `n` is an input integer, but it is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input**
