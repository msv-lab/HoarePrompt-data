Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to the final value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `comps[i]` is equal to the final value of `col`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to the final value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `comps[i]` is equal to the final value of `col`**
