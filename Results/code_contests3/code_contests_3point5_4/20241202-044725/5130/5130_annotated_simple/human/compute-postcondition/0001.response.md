Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each element in the input list obtained by splitting the raw input. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as an input integer, and it is not directly affected by the code snippet, the output state is simply: `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
