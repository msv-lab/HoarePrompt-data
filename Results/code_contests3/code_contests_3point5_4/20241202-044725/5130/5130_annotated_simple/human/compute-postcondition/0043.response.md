According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` was adjusted to a value other than 0, so it needs to be reset to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to the final value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[p[j]]` is adjusted back to 0, `comps[i]` is equal to the final value of `col`**
