According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[p[j]]` was adjusted to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` needs to remain 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `b` is a mapped list of integers, `comps` is a list where each element is equal to the final value of `col`, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[p[j]]` is adjusted back to 0, `comps[i]` is equal to the final value of `col`, `j` is updated to the value at index `j` in list `p`, `comps[j]` is equal to the final value of `col`**.
