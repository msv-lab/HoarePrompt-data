Example Answer:
The variable `col` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n`, `b`, and `comps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is a mapped list of integers from the raw input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 0**
