Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, and `j` is the last assigned value in the loop.***
