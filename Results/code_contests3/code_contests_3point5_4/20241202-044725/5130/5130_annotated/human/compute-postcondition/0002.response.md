Example Answer:
The list `b` is reassigned the result of mapping the input values to integers. Since `b` was originally a list of n integers, after the execution of the code, it becomes a map object of n integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers**
