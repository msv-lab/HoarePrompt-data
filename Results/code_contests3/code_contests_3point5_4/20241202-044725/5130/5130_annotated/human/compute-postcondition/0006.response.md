Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0. The `i-th` element of `comps` is 0***
