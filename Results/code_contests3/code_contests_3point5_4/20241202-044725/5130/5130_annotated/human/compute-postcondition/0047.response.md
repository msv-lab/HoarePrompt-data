Example Answer:
`j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`. The value of `p[j]` determines the new value of `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0, and `j` is updated to the new value determined by `p[j]`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0, and `j` is updated to the new value determined by `p[j]**.
