According to the code, the loop will execute n times, where n is the value of the integer `n`. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
