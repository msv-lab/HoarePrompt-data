Example Answer:
A list comprehension is used to create a list `comps` of size `n` where each element is initialized to 0. Since the initial states of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0**
