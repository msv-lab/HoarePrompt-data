Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 1, `i` is one greater than the previous value, `j` is updated to a value where `comps[p[j]] != 0`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col` after the execution of the if else block.***
