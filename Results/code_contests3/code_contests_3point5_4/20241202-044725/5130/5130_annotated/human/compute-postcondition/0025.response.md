According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 1, `i` is one greater than the previous value, `j` is equal to the new value of `i`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0` should be true. This means that `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `comps[p[j]]` which should be set to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 1, `i` is one greater than the previous value, `j` is equal to the new value of `i`, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` should be 0**
