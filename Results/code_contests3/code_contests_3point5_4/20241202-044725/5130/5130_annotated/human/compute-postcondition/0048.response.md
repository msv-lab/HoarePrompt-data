Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, where `col` is the new value to be assigned. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0, and `j` is updated to the new value determined by `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is `col`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0, and `j` is updated to the new value determined by `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is `col`**
