According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` needs to be reassigned to a non-zero value. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers with the `i-th` element initialized to 0, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to a new index in the list `p`, `comps[p[j]]` is reassigned to a non-zero value, `comps[j]` is updated to `col` for the loop to execute again**
