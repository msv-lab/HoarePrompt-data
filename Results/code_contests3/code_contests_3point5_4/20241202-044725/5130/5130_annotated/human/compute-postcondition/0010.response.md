According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. Right before the loop, `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0. Therefore, `comps[p[j]]` should be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers with the `i-th` element initialized to 0, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 0, `comps[p[j]]` is adjusted to 0**
