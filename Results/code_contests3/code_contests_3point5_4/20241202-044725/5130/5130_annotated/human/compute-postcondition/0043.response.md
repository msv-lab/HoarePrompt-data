According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be equal to 0. Therefore, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `comps[p[j]]` needs to be updated to 0
- `j` needs to be updated to a value where `comps[p[j]] == 0`

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1, `col` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to a value where `comps[p[j]] == 0`, and `comps[j]` is updated to a value other than `col`, `j` is updated to `p[j` and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
