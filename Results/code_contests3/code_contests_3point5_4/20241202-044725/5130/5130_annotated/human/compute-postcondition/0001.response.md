Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it, converts each value to an integer, and subtracts 1 from it. Therefore, the list `p` will contain the input values converted to integers and decremented by 1. The other variables `n` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**
