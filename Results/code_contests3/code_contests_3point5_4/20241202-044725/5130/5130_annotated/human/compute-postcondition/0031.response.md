According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` needs to be 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, so for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` should be set to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 1, `i` is one greater than the previous value, `j` is equal to the new value of `i`, and for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` should be 0 and after the execution of the code fragment, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`**
