Example Answer: 
`col` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0, `col` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers initialized to 0, `col` is 0**
