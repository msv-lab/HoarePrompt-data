Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value from the input using `raw_input()`. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2·10^5, the value of `n` will be within that range. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n, b is a list of n integers where each integer is either 0 or 1**.
