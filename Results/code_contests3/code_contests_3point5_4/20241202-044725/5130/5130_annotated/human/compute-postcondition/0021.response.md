According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one less than `n`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, `j` will be updated to the last assigned value of `i` after the loop executes. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 0, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is one greater than the previous value, and `j` is the last assigned value in the loop**
