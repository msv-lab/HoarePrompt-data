Example Answer:
`comps[i]` is updated to the value of `col`. Since `col` is increased by 1 before this statement, the value of `comps[i]` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1, `col` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to a value where `comps[p[j]] != 0`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col` after the execution of the if else block for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1, `col` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is updated to a value where `comps[p[j]] != 0`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col` after the execution of the if else block for the loop to execute one more time.**
