Example Answer:
`col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is 0, so after execution, `col` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers where all elements are updated to 1 after the execution of the program fragment, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is one greater than the previous value, and `j` is the last assigned value in the loop.
