Example Answer:
The value of `comps[j]` is updated to `col`. The value of `j` is updated to a new index in the list `p`. Then, `comps[p[j]]` is reassigned to a non-zero value to allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers with the `i-th` element initialized to 0, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to a new index in the list `p`, `comps[p[j]]` is reassigned to a non-zero value to allow the loop to execute again, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `p` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a map object of n integers, `comps` is a list of n integers with the `i-th` element initialized to 0, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to a new index in the list `p`, `comps[p[j]]` is reassigned to a non-zero value to allow the loop to execute again, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`**
