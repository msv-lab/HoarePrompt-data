Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads input values, processes them to assign unique components, and then prints the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed. The logic used in the program ensures that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements, as required by the problem description. Additionally, the program handles all possible cases within the given constraints.
