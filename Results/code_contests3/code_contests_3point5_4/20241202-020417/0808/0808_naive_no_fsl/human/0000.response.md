Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input integer 'n'. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to a given limit. The algorithm marks all multiples of each prime number as composite, leaving only the prime numbers themselves. The program then counts the remaining prime numbers within the range specified by the input 'n'. The program logic aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, it correctly identifies the prime numbers.
