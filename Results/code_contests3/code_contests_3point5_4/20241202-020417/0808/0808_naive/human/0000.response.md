Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly generates a list of boolean values where True indicates a prime number and False indicates a non-prime number. It then reads each dataset from the input, converts it to an integer, and prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to that integer. The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently generate the prime numbers up to 1000000. The logic seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
