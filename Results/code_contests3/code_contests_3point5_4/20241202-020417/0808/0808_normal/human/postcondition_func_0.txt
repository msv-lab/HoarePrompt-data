The function `func` initializes a list `a` of 1000000 elements with all elements set to True. It then iterates over the range from 2 to 999,999 and marks non-prime indices in the list as False. After that, the function reads input from `sys.stdin`, converts it to an integer `s`, and prints the count of prime numbers between index 1 and `s - 1` from the list `a`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value.
