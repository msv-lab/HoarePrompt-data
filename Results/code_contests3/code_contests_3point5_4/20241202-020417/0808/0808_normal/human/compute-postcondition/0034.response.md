According to the code, the loop will execute for each line of input available from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to True. Since the loop reads input from `sys.stdin`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line of input available.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to True, there is another line of input available from `sys.stdin`**
