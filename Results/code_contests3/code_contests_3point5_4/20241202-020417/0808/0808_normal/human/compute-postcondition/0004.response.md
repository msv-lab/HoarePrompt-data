Example Answer: 
The element at index i-1 in list a is set to False, where i is 2. Therefore, the element at index 1 in list a is set to False. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements where the element at index 1 is False, i is 2**
