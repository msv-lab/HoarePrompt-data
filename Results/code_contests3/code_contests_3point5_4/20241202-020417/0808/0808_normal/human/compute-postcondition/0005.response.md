According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the element at index 1 is False, `i` is 2. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than 1000000. Since `j` is defined as `i ** 2 - 1` at the start of each iteration, the next `j` value would be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where the element at index 1 is False, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1000000 and `j` is `i ** 2 - 1 + i`**
