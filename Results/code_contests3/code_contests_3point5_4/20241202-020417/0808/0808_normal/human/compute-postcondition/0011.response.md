According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from index 1 are set to False, `i` is 3**
