According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. In this case, `i` is given as 3, and `j` is dependent on the loop range and iteration. The loop will execute as long as the loop range starting from `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1000000, and `i` is not 0. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from index 1 are set to False, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `j` should be in the range of `i ** 2 - 1` to 999999**
