Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from index 1 are set to False. `i` is 2 and the program checks if the element at index 1 is True. If it is True, the program does nothing and maintains the state of `n`, `a`, and `i` as described.***
