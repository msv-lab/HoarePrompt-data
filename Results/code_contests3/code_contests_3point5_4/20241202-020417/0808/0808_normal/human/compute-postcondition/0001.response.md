According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is in the range from 2 to 999,999. Before the loop starts, n is not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: i is 2.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 elements all set to True, i is 2 for the loop to execute**
