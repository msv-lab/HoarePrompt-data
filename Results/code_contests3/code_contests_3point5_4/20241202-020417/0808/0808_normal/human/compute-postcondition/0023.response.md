According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` falls within the range from `i ** 2 - 1` to 999,999 inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1002 and `j` is equal to `i`, which is 1002, and `a[j]` is set to False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next multiple of `i` greater than the current value of `j`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from index 1 are set to False, `i` is 1002, `j` is the next multiple of 1002 greater than 1002, `a[j]` is set to False**
