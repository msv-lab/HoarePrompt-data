Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements where all elements at indices that are multiples of 2 starting from index 1 are set to False, `i` is 1001. If the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is True, the program does not perform any change. Otherwise, the program keeps the initial state unchanged with `n`, `a`, and `i` retaining their original values.***
