According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range specified includes at least one iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value that falls within the range specified by the loop. In this case, `j` should be set to `i ** 2 - 1` to ensure the loop executes at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 (since `j` should be adjusted to `i ** 2 - 1` to ensure the loop executes the first time)**
