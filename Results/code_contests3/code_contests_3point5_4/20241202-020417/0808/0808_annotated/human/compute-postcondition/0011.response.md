According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `a[i - 1] is True`. If `a[i - 1]` is True, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, `i` is 2. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `a[1]` must be True.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, `i` is 3. If a[i - 1] is True, then the program continues with the given state**.
