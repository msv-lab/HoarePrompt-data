Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, `i` is 2. If a[i - 1] is True, then the program continues with the given state. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
