According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 2 to 999,999. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1001. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1002. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, all these indexes will be False, `i` is 1002, all indexes `a[j]` are False for all j such that j is a multiple of a prime number greater than 2**
