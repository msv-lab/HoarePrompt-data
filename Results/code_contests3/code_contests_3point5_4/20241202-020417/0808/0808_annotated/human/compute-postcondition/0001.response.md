According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is within the range of 2 to 999,999. Since the loop starts at 2, the loop will definitely execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999 and `a` is a list of 1000000 True values, and `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values, `i` is 2**
