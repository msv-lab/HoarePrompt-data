Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, all these indexes are set to False, `i` is 1002, all indexes `a[j]` are False for all j such that j is a multiple of a prime number greater than 2, `a` has at least 1002^2 - 1 elements, after the execution of the if statement, all elements in `a` that are multiples of the square of 1002 have been set to False.***
