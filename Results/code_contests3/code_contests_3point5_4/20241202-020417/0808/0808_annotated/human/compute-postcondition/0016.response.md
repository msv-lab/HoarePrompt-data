According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `a[j]` is False and `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is False. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the next index `j` should be `i ** 2 - 1` and `a[j]` should be False for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values except for the indexes that are multiples of prime numbers greater than 2, `i` is 4, `a[i - 1]` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, the next index `j` should be `i ** 2 - 1`, `a[j]` is False**
