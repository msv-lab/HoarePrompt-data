Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads an integer `n` and prints the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a list `a` of 1000000 True values and then updates certain indexes to False based on prime numbers. The program then reads integers from the standard input and prints the count of True values in the list `a` from index 1 to the read integer. This process is repeated until there are no more elements in the standard input.

The program follows the problem description accurately and always outputs the correct number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.
