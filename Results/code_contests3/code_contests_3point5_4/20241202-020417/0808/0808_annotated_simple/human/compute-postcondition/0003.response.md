According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as the range provided in the for loop is valid. In this case, the loop will execute if the range is at least 1 element long.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
1. `i` needs to be such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000` to ensure the loop range is valid.
2. The element at index `i-1` in list `a` needs to be True to satisfy the condition in the for loop range.

State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements all set to True, `i` is a value such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`, the element at index `i-1` in list `a` is True for the loop to execute the first time**
