Example Answer:
The j-th element of list `a` is set to False. Since `i` is determined by the existence of at least one False value in list `a`, and there exists at least one False value in the updated list `a`, the value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with the j-th element set to False, `i` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with the j-th element set to False, `i` remains the same**
