According to the code, the loop can execute if the range of `j` includes at least one value. The range of `j` is from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1000000 with a step size of `i`. Since `i` is 1000000, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is 999,999 and `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with specific conditions. To satisfy the loop condition, `j` should be equal to `i ** 2 - 1` to execute the loop the first time.
State: **`n` is 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 elements with specific conditions, `i` is 1000000, `j` is 1000000 **
