Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program does not read the input values correctly. It attempts to read input from `sys.stdin`, but it does not handle the multiple datasets as specified in the problem description. The program should read input until the end of the input stream and process each dataset separately.

2. The program does not check if a number is prime or not. It simply counts the number of `True` values in the list `a`, which does not necessarily represent prime numbers.

3. The logic used to mark non-prime numbers in the list `a` is incorrect. This will result in incorrect counts of prime numbers.

Overall, the program does not correctly calculate the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` as required by the problem description.
