Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer N as input representing the shift value and a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. The program then shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string.

The program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description:
1. It shifts each character of S by N in alphabetical order.
2. It correctly handles the case where N = 0, which means no shifting is required.
3. It correctly handles the case where N = 26, as the letters wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet after 26 shifts.
4. It correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description for N and the length of S.

Since the program covers all potential cases and produces the expected output for each case mentioned in the problem description, it can be considered correct.
