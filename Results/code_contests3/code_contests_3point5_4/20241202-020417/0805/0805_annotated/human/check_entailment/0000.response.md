Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input and shifts each character of `S` by `N` positions in alphabetical order. The program follows the constraints specified in the problem description, such as ensuring that `N` is within the range 0 to 26 and that `S` consists of uppercase English letters.

The program uses modular arithmetic to handle cases where the addition of the index and `N` exceeds 26, ensuring that the shifting is done cyclically. Additionally, the program correctly maps the shifted index back to the corresponding letter in the alphabet.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the given problem description for all potential cases.
