Example Answer:
new_s is assigned the value of letters[new_index], where letters is a list of uppercase English letters. The value of index is the position of character s in the string letters, added_index is the result of index + N, and new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `strings` is a string input with at least 1 character, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the input string for the loop to execute, index is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, added_index is the result of the calculation index + N, new_index is the result of the calculation added_index modulo 26, new_s is the result of accessing the new_indexth element in the list `letters`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `strings` is a string input with at least 1 character, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the input string for the loop to execute, index is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, added_index is the result of the calculation index + N, new_index is the result of the calculation added_index modulo 26, new_s is the result of accessing the new_indexth element in the list `letters`**
