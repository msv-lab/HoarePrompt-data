Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of `s` in `letters` and `n` is the given integer. The value of `added_index` may vary based on the initial values of `index` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a string input with more characters left, `new_strings` is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, `s` is the next character in the input string, index is the index of `s` in `letters`, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in `letters`.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a string input with more characters left, `new_strings` is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, `s` is the next character in the input string, index is the index of `s` in `letters`, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in `letters`**
