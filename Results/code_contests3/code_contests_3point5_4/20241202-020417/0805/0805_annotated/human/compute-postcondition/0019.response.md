Example Answer:
The value of `new_index` is calculated as the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. Since `added_index` can be any value, `new_index` will be in the range of 0 to 25. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left to iterate, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, new_index is between 0 and 25.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left to iterate, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, new_index is between 0 and 25**
