Example Answer: 
`new_strings` is appended with the character at position `new_index` in the list `letters`. The value of `N` determines the shift in the alphabet for each character. The loop iterates over each character in the input string `S`, shifting it by `N` positions in the alphabet and adding the shifted character to `new_strings`. The final `new_strings` will contain the shifted version of the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a string input, `new_strings` is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, `s` is the first character in the input string, index is the index of `s` in `letters`, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in `letters`.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a string input, `new_strings` is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, `s` is the first character in the input string, index is the index of `s` in `letters`, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in `letters`**
