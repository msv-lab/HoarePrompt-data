Example Answer:
`new_strings` is assigned an empty string. The value of `new_strings` is now an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; N is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26; `strings` is a string input; `new_strings` is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; N is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26; `strings` is a string input; `new_strings` is an empty string**
