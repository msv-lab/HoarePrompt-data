Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at the `new_index`th position in `letters`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as `(index + N) % 26`. The initial values of `N`, `index` are known. Based on these values, `added_index` and `new_index` can be calculated. Since `N` is within the specified range and `S` contains only uppercase English letters, the output state will be: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, s is the next character in the input string, index is the index of s in letters, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in letters.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, s is the next character in the input string, index is the index of s in letters, added_index is the result of index + N, new_index is the result of added_index modulo 26, new_s is the character at the new_indexth position in letters.**
