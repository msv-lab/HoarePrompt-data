Example Answer: 
The code snippet `print(new_strings)` will output the value of `new_strings`. Since we do not have any information about how `new_strings` is calculated or modified, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is an empty string, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters. 
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is an empty string, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters**
