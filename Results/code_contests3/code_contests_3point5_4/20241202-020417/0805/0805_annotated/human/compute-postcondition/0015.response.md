Example Answer:
After the execution of the code, the character `new_s` is added to the `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is calculated based on the shifting of characters in the uppercase English letters by the value of `N`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters.**
