Example Answer:
The value of `added_index` is calculated by adding the value of `index` to `n`. The value of `index` is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `n` is the given integer. Since the initial state values are not provided, the output state will be: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `strings` is a string input with at least 1 character, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the input string for the loop to execute, index is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, added_index is the result of the calculation index + n.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `strings` is a string input with at least 1 character, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the input string for the loop to execute, index is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, added_index is the result of the calculation index + n**
