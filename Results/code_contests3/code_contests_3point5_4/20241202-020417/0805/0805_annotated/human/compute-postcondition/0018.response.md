Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are unknown, so the final value of `added_index` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left to iterate, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters.
Output State: **N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left to iterate, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters**
