Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of `index + n`. The value of `n` is between 0 and 26, so `added_index` will be between 0 and 52. After taking the modulo operation with 26, `new_index` will be between 0 and 25. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; `strings` is a string input with at least 1 character, `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character in the input string for the loop to execute, index is the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, added_index is the result of the calculation index + n, new_index is the result of the calculation added_index modulo 26.
