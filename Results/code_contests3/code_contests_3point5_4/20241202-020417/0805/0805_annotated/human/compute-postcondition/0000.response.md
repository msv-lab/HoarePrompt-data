Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be determined by the input provided by the user, within the range of 0 to 26. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; N is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4; N is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26.**
