Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, so `new_s` will be a character from the `letters` string based on the index. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer within the specified range, S is a string of uppercase English letters, strings is a string input with more characters left to iterate, new_strings is a transformed string based on the shifting of characters, new_index is between 0 and 25, new_s is a character based on the index in the letters string.
