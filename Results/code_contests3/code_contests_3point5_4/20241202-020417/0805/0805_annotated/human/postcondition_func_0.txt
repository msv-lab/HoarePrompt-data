The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a string of uppercase English letters `strings`. It then shifts each letter in `strings` by `n` positions cyclically in the alphabet and prints the resulting transformed string `new_strings`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range 0 to 26, and it assumes the input string `strings` consists only of uppercase English letters.
