The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from the user input. It then shifts each character in the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet (considering only uppercase English letters) and prints the resulting modified string. The function operates under the constraints that `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4. The function does not have an explicit return value.
