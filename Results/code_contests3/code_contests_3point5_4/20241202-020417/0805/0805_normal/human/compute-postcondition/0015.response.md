Example Answer:
`new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`, adding the character `new_s` to the end of `new_strings`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s.**
