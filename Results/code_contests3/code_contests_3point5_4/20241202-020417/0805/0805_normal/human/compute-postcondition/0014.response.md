Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value at index `new_index` in the `letters` list. The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, so `new_s` will be a character from the `letters` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list**
