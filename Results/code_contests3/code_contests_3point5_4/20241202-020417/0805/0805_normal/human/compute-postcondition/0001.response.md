The variable `strings` is assigned the value of the user input, but the previous values of all variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4**
