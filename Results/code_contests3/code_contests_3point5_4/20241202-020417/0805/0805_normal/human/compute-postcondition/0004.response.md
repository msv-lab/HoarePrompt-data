According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings. If the strings list has at least 1 string, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, new_strings is empty. So, for the loop to execute, the strings list must have at least 1 string, and the current string being processed is the first string in the list.
State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time strings is a list of strings with at least 1 string, s is the first string in the list**
