Example Answer:
`new_strings` is initialized as an empty string. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, new_strings is an empty string.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4, new_strings is an empty string**
