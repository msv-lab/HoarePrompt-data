Example Answer:
`new_strings` is updated with the addition of `new_s`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s, `strings` must have more elements than before, added_index is the calculated sum of `index + N`, new_index is the remainder of the division of added_index by 26.
