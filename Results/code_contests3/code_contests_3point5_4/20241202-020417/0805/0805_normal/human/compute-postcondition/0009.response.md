Example Answer:
`new_s` is appended to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is the character at the `new_index` position in the `letters` list. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list**
