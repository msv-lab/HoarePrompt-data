Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as the remainder of the division of `index + N` by 26. Since `index` and `N` are known to be integers between 0 and 26, the value of `new_index` will also be between 0 and 25. Therefore, `new_s` will be a character from the `letters` list. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s, `strings` must have more elements than before, added_index is the calculated sum of `index + N`, new_index is the remainder of the division of added_index by 26**
