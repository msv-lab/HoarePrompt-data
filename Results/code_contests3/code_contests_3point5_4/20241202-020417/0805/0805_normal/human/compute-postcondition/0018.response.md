Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value `index + n`, where `index` is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, and `n` is an integer between 0 and 26. The value of `added_index` will depend on the initial values of `index` and `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s, and `strings` must have more elements than before, added_index is the calculated sum of `index + n`.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s, and `strings` must have more elements than before, added_index is the calculated sum of `index + n`**
