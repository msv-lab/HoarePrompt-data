Example Answer: 
`new_index` is calculated as the remainder of the division of `added_index` by 26. The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of 's' in the `letters` list and `n` is the integer value of N. Since `N` can be any integer between 0 and 26, `added_index` can range from 0 to 52. Therefore, `new_index` will range from 0 to 25. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25, new_s is a character from the `letters` list, new_strings is updated with the addition of new_s, and `strings` must have more elements than before, added_index is the calculated sum of `index + n`, new_index is the remainder of the division of added_index by 26**
