Example Answer:
The variable `letters` is assigned the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', which doesn't affect the initial state variables N and S. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^4**
