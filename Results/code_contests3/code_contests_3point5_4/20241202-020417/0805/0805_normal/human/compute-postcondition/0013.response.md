Example Answer:
The new_index is assigned the value of added_index modulo 26. The value of added_index can vary, but for this specific case, we know that N is between 0 and 26. Therefore, new_index will be the remainder of added_index divided by 26. Since N is an integer between 0 and 26, the range of new_index will be between 0 and 25. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25.
Output State: **N is an integer between 0 and 26, S is a string, new_strings is a string consisting of characters from the `letters` list, for the loop to execute another time `strings` must have more elements, index is the index of 's' in the `letters` list, new_index is an integer between 0 and 25**
