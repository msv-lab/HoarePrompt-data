Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input. It then iterates through each character in the string `S`, shifts the character by `N` positions in a circular manner, and constructs a new string `new_strings` with the shifted characters. Finally, it prints the new string.

The program correctly implements the problem description by shifting each character of the input string `S` by `N` positions in alphabetical order. It ensures that the shifted characters wrap around if they exceed the length of the alphabet. The program covers all possible cases specified in the problem description and correctly produces the expected output.
