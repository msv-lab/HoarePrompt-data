Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `letters` is presumably a list of characters and `new_index` is between 0 and 25. The value of `new_s` will be the character at the index `new_index` in the `letters` list. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list.
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list**
