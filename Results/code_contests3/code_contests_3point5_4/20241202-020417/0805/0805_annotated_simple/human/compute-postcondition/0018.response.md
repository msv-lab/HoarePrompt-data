Example Answer: 
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` list. Since the exact values of `index` and `n` are not provided, the output state is: The value of `added_index` is the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`. `added_index` may vary based on the specific values of `index` and `n`.
Output State: **The value of `added_index` is the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`. `added_index` may vary based on the specific values of `index` and `n`.**
