Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index` plus `n`. The specific values of `index` and `n` are unknown, so the exact outcome cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `index` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of string `s` in the `letters` string, and `added_index` is the result of adding `n` to `index`.
Output State: **The value of `index` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of string `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the result of adding `n` to `index`**
