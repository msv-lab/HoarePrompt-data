According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings. If the strings list has at least 1 string, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, the new_strings is empty. So for the loop to execute the first time, the strings list must have at least 1 string, and the current string `s` is the first string in the list.
State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` list has at least 1 string, `s` is the first string in the list**
