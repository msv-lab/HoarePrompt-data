Example Answer:
The value of `new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `new_index` is calculated based on the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`; `new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`.
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is calculated based on the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`; `new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`**
