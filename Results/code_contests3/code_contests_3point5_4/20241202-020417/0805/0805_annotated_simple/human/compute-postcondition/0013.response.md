Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. Since `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The possible range of `new_index` is from 0 to 25. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25.
Output State: **The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25**
