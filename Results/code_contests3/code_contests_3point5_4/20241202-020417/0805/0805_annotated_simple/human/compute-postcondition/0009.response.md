Example Answer:
The character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list is added to the `new_strings`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`.
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`**
