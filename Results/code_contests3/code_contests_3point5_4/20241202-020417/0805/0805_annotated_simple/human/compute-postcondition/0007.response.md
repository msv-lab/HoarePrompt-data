Example Answer:
The value of `new_index` is calculated by taking the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. `added_index` is the result of adding `n` to `index`, where `index` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of string `s` in the `letters` string. Therefore, `new_index` will be a value between 0 and 25. 
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25**
