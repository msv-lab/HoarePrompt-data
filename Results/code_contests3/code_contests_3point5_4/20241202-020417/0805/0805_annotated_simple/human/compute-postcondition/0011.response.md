Example Answer:
The value of `index` is assigned the index of character `s` in the `letters` list. The value of `s` is unknown, but the previous value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, so the value of `index` will be between 0 and 25 as well. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `strings` list, `index` is between 0 and 25.
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements in the `strings` list, `index` is between 0 and 25**
