Example Answer:
The value of `new_s` is added to the end of `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is determined by the character at index `new_index` in the `letters` list. The values of `added_index`, `index`, and `n` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character from the `letters` list at index `new_index`, and `new_strings` is updated with the new character.
Output State: **The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the character from the `letters` list at index `new_index`, and `new_strings` is updated with the new character**
