Example Answer:
The code simply prints the contents of the `new_strings` variable. The value of `new_strings` contains the characters from the `letters` list that are shifted by `n` positions in a circular manner. Without knowing the specific values of `new_strings` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact output.
Output State: **unchanged**
