Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, so `new_s` will be a character from the `letters` list at index `new_index`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25, and `new_s` is the character from the `letters` list at index `new_index`.
Output State: **The value of `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is between 0 and 25; `new_index` is between 0 and 25, and `new_s` is the character from the `letters` list at index `new_index`**
