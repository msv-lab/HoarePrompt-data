Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index` modulo 26. The value of `added_index` is the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`, so the value of `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. Therefore, the output state is: The value of `new_index` is calculated based on the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`.
Output State: **The value of `new_index` is calculated based on the sum of the index of character `s` and an unknown value `n`**
