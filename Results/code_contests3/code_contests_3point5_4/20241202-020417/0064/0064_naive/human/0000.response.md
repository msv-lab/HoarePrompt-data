Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, calculates the sum of the coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, it returns -1 as expected. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the initial bet value. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
