Example Answer: 
The sum of all integers in the iterator object `c` is calculated and assigned to variable `s`. The initial state is that `c` is an iterator object containing integers. After execution, the value of `s` will be the sum of all integers in `c`. 
Output State: **`c` is an iterator object containing integers, `s` is the sum of all integers in `c`**
