Example Answer:
The code snippet prints -1 if the sum of all integers in `c` is 0 or the sum is not divisible evenly by the length of `c`, otherwise, it prints the average of the sum. The sum `s` and the length of `c` are the only variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is an iterator object containing integers, `s` is the sum of all integers in `c`, and the code snippet prints either -1 or the average of the sum based on the conditions.
Output State: **`c` is an iterator object containing integers, `s` is the sum of all integers in `c`, and the code snippet prints either -1 or the average of the sum based on the conditions**
