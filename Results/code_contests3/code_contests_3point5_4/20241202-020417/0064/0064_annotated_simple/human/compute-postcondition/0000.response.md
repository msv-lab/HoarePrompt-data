Example Answer:
The `map` function is applied to the input obtained by splitting the raw input by spaces. The `map` function converts each element of the input into an integer. Since the `map` function returns an iterator, `c` will contain the iterator object after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: c is an iterator object containing integers.
Output State: **c is an iterator object containing integers**
