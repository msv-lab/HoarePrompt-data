Correctness: **True**

The program takes in the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by 5 (the number of players). If the sum is not divisible by 5 or if the sum is 0, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid initial bet size. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average number of coins each player initially bet.

The program follows the problem description correctly as it determines the initial bet size based on the final number of coins each player has at the end of the game, as described in the problem statement.
