Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input values, calculates the sum of the coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is, it calculates and prints the average (initial bet) as the sum divided by the number of players. If the sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1 as per the problem description. The program follows the problem description and will correctly determine the initial bet or indicate if such outcome is not possible.
