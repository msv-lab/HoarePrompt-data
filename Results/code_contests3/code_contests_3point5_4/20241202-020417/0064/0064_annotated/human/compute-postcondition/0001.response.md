Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. The variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers input by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers input by the user; `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers input by the user; `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`**
