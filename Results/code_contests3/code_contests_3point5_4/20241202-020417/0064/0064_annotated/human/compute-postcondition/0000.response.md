Example Answer:
The values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are assigned using map to convert the input values to integers. The input values are taken from raw_input() and split. As the initial states of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers between 0 and 100, after the execution of the code, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 will be assigned the new values input by the user.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers input by the user**
