Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a list of integers from user input, calculates the sum of the integers in the list, and prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of elements in the list, or the average of the integers if the sum is not 0 and is divisible by the number of elements in the list. The function does not accept any input parameters and does not have a specific return value.**
