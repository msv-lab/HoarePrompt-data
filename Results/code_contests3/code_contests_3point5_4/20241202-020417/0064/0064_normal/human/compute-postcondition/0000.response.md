Example Answer:
c is assigned the values obtained by converting the input string into a list of integers using map and split. Since c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers between 0 and 100, the values assigned to c are also integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100**
