Example Answer:
The sum of all the integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 is calculated and assigned to variable s. Since the initial state specifies that c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers between 0 and 100, the sum of these integers will also be between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100; s is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 500.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 <= 100; s is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 500**
