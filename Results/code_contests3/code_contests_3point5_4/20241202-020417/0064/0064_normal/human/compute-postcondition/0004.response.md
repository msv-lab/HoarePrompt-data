Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not evenly divisible by the number of integers in the list, or the average of the integers if the sum is not 0 and evenly divisible by the number of integers in the list. The function does not have a specified return value. **
