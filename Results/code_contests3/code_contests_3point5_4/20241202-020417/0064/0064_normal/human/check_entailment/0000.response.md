Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a list of 5 integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is 0 or not evenly divisible by 5 (the number of integers in the list), or the average of the integers if the sum is not 0 and evenly divisible by 5. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
