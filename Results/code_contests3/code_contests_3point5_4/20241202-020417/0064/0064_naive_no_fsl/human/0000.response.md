Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the sum of coins and divides it by the number of players to determine the initial bet value. It also checks if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of players, in which case it outputs -1. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all possible cases.
