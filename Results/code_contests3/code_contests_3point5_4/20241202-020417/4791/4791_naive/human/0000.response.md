Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It is trying to print the level of the passage connecting two rooms based on a binary operation, which does not guarantee that the levels satisfy the condition mentioned in the problem description. The program does not set the levels in a way that ensures the number of times passing through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room.

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
3

Expected Output:
1 1
1

Actual Output:
1

This example shows that the program is not setting the levels correctly to satisfy the given condition for all rooms.
