Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. As j is 2, j + 1 is 3, which in binary is 11. The rightmost set bit is at position 1, so the output is 1.
Output State: **Position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is 1**
