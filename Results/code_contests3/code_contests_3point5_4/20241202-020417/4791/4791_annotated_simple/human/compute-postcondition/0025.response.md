According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 
State: **At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than 2**
