According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should be greater than the new value of `j`.
State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than 2**
