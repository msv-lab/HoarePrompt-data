According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, and the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n-1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and the value `n` is printed**
