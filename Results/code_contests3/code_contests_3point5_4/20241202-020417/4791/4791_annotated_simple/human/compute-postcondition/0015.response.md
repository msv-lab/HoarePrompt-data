Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then prints that position. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact output value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and the value `n` is printed.
Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and the value `n` is printed**
