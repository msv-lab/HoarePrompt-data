According to the code, whether the loop can execute and print the value of `n` depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, and the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j+1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, `j+1` must be less than `n`.
State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and print the value of `n` again `j` must be less than `n`**
