According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is a power of 2 between 1 and 499, `j` is 0. In the next iteration, `n` is doubled, and the value of the least significant bit position of `j+1` in binary representation is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be doubled, and `j` should be incremented by 1.
State: **N is between 2 and 500, n is a power of 2 between 2 and 998, j is 1**
