Example Answer:
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since the condition for the loop to execute is that `j` must be less than `n`, and `n` should be doubled for the loop to execute again, the loop will not execute after this decrement. The other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **N is between 2 and 500, n is between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of n is n, for the loop to execute and print the value of n, j must be less than n, n should be doubled for the loop to execute again**
