Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1. The value of `N` is between 2 and 500, so after execution, `n` will be between 1 and 499. The loop will continue as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 499.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 499**
