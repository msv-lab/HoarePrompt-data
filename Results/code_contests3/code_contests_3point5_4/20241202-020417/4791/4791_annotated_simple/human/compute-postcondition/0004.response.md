Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1, then converted to binary, reversed, and the index of the first '1' is found and added 1 to get the final result. Since the initial value of `j` is 0, after running the code, the output is 1.
Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
