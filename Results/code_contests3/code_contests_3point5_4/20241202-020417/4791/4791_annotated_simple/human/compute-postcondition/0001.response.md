According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `n` is assigned the input value, which is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Since `n` is not equal to 0, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), n is not equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
