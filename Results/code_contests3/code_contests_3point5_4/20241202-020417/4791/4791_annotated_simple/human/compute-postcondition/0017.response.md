Example Answer: 
The code prints the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute, and the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, the output will be the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and print the value of `n` again `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 2 and 500, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n`, for the loop to execute and print the value of `n` again `j` must be less than `n`**
