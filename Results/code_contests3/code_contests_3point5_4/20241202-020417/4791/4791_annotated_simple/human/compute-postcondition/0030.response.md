Functionality: **The function prompts the user to input a value for n. It then iterates n times, decrementing the value of n each time. Within each iteration, it iterates over a range of numbers, converts each number to binary, finds the position of the rightmost '1' bit, and prints that position. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The code does not account for invalid inputs when the user enters non-integer inputs.
- The code does not have any handling for errors that may occur during the input process.
- The annotations mention a variable N at the beginning, but it is not used in the code provided.
