Example Answer: 
The code prints the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is `n-1`, so `j + 1` is `n`. The binary representation of `n` will have its rightmost '1' bit at position `n-1`, so `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` will return `n-1 + 1 = n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute and the value `n` is printed.
Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `n` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute and the value `n` is printed.**
