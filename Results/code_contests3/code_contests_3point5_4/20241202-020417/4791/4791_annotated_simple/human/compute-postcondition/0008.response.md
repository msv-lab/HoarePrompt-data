Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of j + 1. Since j is 3, j + 1 is 4 which in binary is 100. The rightmost '1' bit is at position 3. Therefore, the Output State is: N is between 2 and 500, n is between 1 and 499, j is 3 and the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is 3.
Output State: **N is between 2 and 500, n is between 1 and 499, j is 3 and the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of j + 1 is 3**
