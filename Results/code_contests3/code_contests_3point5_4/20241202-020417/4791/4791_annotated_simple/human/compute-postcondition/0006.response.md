Example Answer:
`j + 1` is 3, `bin(3)` is '0b11', `[::-1]` reverses the string to '11', `.find('1')` returns the index of the first occurrence of '1' which is 0, and finally, we add 1 to get 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 2**
