According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) and n is an integer between 1 and 499. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, and `j` is 0.
State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is between 1 and 499, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
