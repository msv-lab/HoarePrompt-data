The function prompts the user to input a value for n. It then iterates n times, decrementing the value of n each time. Within each iteration, it iterates over a range of numbers, converts each number to binary, finds the position of the rightmost '1' bit, and prints that position. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
