Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly set levels to the passages as required by the problem description. The logic in the program is not handling the condition where "the number of times we pass through a passage is always even" when leaving and returning to a room. The program is using the `bin` function and finding the rightmost set bit position, which does not guarantee that the levels of the passages will satisfy the given condition for all rooms. 

For example, for N=3, the program output might be:
```
1 1
1
```
This output does not ensure that the number of times the passage is passed through is always even as required by the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect.
