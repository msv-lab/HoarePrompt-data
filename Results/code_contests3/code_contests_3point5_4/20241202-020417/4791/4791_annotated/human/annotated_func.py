#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: N is an integer between 0 and 1, n is 0, j is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input, decrements it in a loop, and then for each value of `n`, it iterates over the range of `n` to print the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The annotations mention that the function returns an integer `N` between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but there is no explicit return statement in the code provided, so the actual functionality does not align with the annotations. The function does not return any value.
