According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` is not equal to 0**
