According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
