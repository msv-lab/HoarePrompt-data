Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1. The position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of `j + 1` is guaranteed to be 1. Therefore, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` will always be 1.
Output State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 1**
