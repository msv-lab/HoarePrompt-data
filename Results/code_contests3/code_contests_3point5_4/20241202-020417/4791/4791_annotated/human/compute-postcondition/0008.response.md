Example Answer: 
The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary representation of j + 1. Given that j is 2, j + 1 is 3, which in binary is '11'. Reversing it gives '11', and the first '1' is at position 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1**
