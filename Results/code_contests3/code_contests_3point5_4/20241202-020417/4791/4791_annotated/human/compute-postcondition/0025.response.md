According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 1` is printed. For the next iteration, `j` is increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 1` is printed, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n+1`**
