Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary representation of j + 1. Since j is initially 1, j + 1 is 2, which in binary is '10'. Reversing it gives '01', and the position of the first '1' is at index 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1**
