Example Answer:
The code prints the position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n+1`. The output state will depend on the values of `j` and `n`.

Output State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 1` is printed, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n+1`**
