Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The code prints the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, so the output will be the position of the rightmost '1' bit in binary representation of 1, which is 1.**
