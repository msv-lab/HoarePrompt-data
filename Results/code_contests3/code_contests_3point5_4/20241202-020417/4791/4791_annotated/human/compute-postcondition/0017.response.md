Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1`. The initial state mentions that the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 2` is 1. Since we are dealing with `j + 1` instead of `j + 2`, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` would be 2. Therefore, the Output State is: The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 2.
Output State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 2**
