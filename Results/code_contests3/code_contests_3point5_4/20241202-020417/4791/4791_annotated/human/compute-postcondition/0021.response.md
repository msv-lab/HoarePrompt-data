According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n-1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n-1` is not equal to 0 and `j` is now 0. 
State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n-1`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n-1` is not equal to 0**
