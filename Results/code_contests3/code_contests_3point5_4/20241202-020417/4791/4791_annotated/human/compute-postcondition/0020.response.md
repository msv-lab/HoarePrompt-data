Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Therefore, after the execution, the Output State is: The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n-1` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute again `n-1` is not equal to 0**
