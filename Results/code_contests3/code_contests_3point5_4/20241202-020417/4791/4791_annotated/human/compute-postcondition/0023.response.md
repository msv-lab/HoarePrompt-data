According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the value of `j` must be less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is `n-1`, `j` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 2` should be `n-1` and `j` should be 1.
State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 2` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `n-1` is not equal to 0, and the value printed is the position of the first '1' in the reverse binary representation of `j + 2`**
