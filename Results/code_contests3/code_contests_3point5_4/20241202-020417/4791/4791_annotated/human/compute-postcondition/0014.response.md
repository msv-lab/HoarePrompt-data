According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition related to the binary representation of `j + 1`. If the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `(j+1) + 1` must be 1.
State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 2` is 1**
