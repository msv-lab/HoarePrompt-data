According to the code, the while loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is considered True. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered True. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `N` should be greater than 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0**
