According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n-1`. The position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of `j + 1` is 1. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be adjusted. Since `n` is currently greater than 0, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute again.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of `j + 1` is 1, loop will execute as `n` is still greater than 0**
