Example Answer:
The binary of `j + 1` is calculated, then reversed, and the position of the first '1' in the reversed binary is found. The initial state mentions that the position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 2` is 1. Since we are dealing with `j + 1` here, the result will be affected accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 1.
Output State: **The position of the first '1' in the reverse of the binary of `j + 1` is 1**
