According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and must be less than `n`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, the position of the first '1' in the reverse of binary of j + 1 is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
