According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. In this case, the loop will go to the next iteration where `j` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` should be less than `n`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
