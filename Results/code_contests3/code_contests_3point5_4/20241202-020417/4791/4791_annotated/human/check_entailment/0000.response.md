Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program does not set levels to the passages in the way described in the problem description. Instead, it prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. This does not align with the objective of setting levels to the passages so that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room. Additionally, the program does not have a return statement to provide the output in the required format. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
