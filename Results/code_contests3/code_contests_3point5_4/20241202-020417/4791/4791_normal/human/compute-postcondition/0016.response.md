According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `j`.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than the current value of `j`**
