According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is a non-zero value. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` needs to be a non-zero value for the loop to execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again**
