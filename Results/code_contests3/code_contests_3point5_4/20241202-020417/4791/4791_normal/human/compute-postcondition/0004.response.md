Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then adds 1 to get the position of the set bit starting from 1. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, so it is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, for the loop to execute `n` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, for the loop to execute `n` is a non-negative integer**
