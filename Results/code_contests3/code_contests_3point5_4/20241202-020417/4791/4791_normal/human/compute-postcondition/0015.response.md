Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1. The result is then printed. The value of j is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact output. 
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0**
