Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1 and then the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated. The `bin()` function converts `j + 1` to a binary string, then the string is reversed using `[::-1]`, and finally, the index of the first '1' in the reversed string is found and incremented by 1. The value of `j` is increased by 1 initially, so the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1, and the result of the expression is printed.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1, and the result of the expression is printed.**
