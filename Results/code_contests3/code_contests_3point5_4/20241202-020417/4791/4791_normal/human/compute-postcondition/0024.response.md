Example Answer:
The value `j + 1` is converted to a binary string using `bin()` function. Then the string is reversed using `[::-1]` and we find the index of the first occurrence of '1' using `find('1')`. Finally, we add 1 to the index value and print the result. The value of `j` is not given in the initial state, so the output state will be: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute another time**
