Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the value of the input, but since the initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, the input function will convert the input to a string type. Therefore, after execution, the value of `n` will be a string. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string**
