Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of (j + 1), starting from 1 as the least significant bit. The result is then printed. The initial value of `j` is not provided, so the specific output cannot be determined.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 2, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the new value of `j`**
