According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is considered truthy. Right before the loop, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the string `n` should not be empty (i.e., have a non-zero length). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a non-empty string for the loop to execute the first time**
