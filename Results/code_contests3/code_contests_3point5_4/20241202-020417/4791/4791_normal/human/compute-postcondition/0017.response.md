Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the least significant bit that is set to 1 in the binary representation of j + 1. The result is then printed. Since the value of j is not provided in the initial state, the exact output cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time n must be greater than the current value of j.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, n is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute one more time n must be greater than the current value of j**
