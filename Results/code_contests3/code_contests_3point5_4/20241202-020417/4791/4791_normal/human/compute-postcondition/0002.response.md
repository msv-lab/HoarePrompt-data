Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1. The value of `N` is between 2 and 500, and `n` is a non-empty string initially. After execution, the value of `n` depends on the initial string value and the decrement operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string that depends on the initial string value and decrement operation.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string that depends on the initial string value and decrement operation**
