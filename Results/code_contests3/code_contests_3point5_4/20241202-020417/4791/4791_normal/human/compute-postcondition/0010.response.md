According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to a smaller non-negative integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer and for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be adjusted to a smaller non-negative integer**
