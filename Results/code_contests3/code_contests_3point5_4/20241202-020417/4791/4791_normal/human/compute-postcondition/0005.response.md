According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, for the loop to execute `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` needs to be incremented by 1**
