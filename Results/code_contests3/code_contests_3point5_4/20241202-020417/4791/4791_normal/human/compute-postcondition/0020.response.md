Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 0 initially, so after execution, `n` will be one less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again and `n` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again and `n` is decremented by 1**
