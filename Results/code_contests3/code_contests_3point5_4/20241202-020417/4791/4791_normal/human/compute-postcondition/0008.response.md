Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then returns the position after reversing the string. 
Since `j` is incremented by 1 before the calculation, the binary representation of `j + 1` will have the rightmost set bit at position `0` (1-indexed). Reversing the string will keep the rightmost set bit at position `0`, so the code will return `1`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1, and the code returns the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1, and the code returns the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`**
