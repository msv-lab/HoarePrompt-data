Functionality: **The function `func` reads input from the user and decrements the input value until it reaches 0. Then, it iterates over a range based on the decremented input value and prints the position of the first '1' in the reversed binary representation of the numbers in the range. The function does not accept any input parameters and does not have any return value.**
