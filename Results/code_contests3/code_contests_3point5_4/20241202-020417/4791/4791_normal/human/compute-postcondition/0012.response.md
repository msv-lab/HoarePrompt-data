According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0. 
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute**
