According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute `N` times as `n` starts with a value between 2 and 500.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1 for each iteration for the loop to execute**
