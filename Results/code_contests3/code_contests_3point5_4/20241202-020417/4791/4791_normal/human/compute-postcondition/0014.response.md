According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current value of `j`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the current value of `j`**
