According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than `j+1`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `j+1`**
