Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1, which means its value decreases by 1 unit. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, it will be adjusted to a smaller non-negative integer after the decrement operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a smaller non-negative integer.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a smaller non-negative integer**
