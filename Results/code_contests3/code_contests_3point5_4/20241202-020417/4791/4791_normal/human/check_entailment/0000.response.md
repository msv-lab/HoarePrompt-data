Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not correctly set the levels to the passages in such a way that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to the same room. The output hints describe the function behavior accurately, but the code implementation itself does not align with the problem requirements. The code prints the position of the first '1' in the reversed binary representation of the numbers in the range, which does not satisfy the condition specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect for the given problem.
