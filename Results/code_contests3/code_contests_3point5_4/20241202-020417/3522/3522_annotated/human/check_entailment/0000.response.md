Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads multiple queries, checks if the input number is odd, subtracts 9 if it is, and then calculates the maximum possible number of composite summands based on the input number. If the input number is in the predefined set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1 as specified. Otherwise, it prints the result of dividing the input by 4 and adding a flag `c` if the number was odd.

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
