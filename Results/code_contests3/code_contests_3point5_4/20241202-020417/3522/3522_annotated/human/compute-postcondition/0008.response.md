According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value provided by the user. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a positive odd integer, `c` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the input value must be greater than 0.
State: **`a` is a positive odd integer, `c` is 1, for the loop to execute another time input value must be greater than 0**
