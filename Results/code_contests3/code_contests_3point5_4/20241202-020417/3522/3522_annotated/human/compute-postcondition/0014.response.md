Example Answer:
If `a` is a positive odd integer greater than 0, and `c` is 0 initially. If `a % 2 != 0`, then `c` is updated to 1. 
The code snippet checks if `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), if it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.
Depending on the value of `a`, the output will vary. If `a` is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then the output will be -1. If not, the output will be `a / 4 + c`.
Output State: **Depends on the value of `a` and whether `c` was updated to 1 or not.**
