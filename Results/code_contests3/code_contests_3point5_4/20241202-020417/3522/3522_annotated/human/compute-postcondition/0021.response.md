Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, `a` is updated to `input - 9` and `c` is set to 1. Then the code checks if `a` is in the values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned the input value, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, and the code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the input value, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd, and the code prints -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`**
