According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value and the value of `c`. If `c` is updated to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state depends on the value of `a` and whether `c` was updated to 1 or not. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `c` must be updated to 1.
State: **Depends on the value of `a` and `c` is updated to 1**
