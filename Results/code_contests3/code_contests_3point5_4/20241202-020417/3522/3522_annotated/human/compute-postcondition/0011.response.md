Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - 9`, where `a` is a positive odd integer greater than 0. Subtracting 9 from an odd number results in another odd number. Therefore, after execution, `a` remains a positive odd integer greater than 0. The state of `c` is not affected.
Output State: **`a` is a positive odd integer greater than 0, `c` is 0**
