Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the input value. Since the input must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute another time, the value of `a` will be a positive odd integer greater than 0. The value of `c` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive odd integer greater than 0, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a positive odd integer greater than 0, `c` is 1**
