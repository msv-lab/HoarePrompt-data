The function `func` reads multiple inputs and performs specific calculations based on the input values. It first checks if the input value is odd, subtracts 9 if it is, updates a flag `c` accordingly. Then, it prints -1 if the input is in a predefined set, otherwise, it prints the result of dividing the input by 4 and adding `c`. The function does not have explicit return values, it performs the calculations and prints the outputs directly.
