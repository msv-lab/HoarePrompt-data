Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input()` accepts an input. The loop will execute one more time if the input is greater than 0. The value of `c` is updated based on the new value of `a`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is updated based on the new value of `a`, for the loop to execute one more time `input()` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`c` is updated based on the new value of `a`, for the loop to execute one more time `input()` should be greater than 0**
