According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. For the loop to execute again, the input value must be greater than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `a` is an odd number, `c` becomes 1 and `a` is decremented by 9. If `a` is not in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the result is `a / 4 + c`. Otherwise, the result is -1.

So for the loop to be executed one more time:
State: **If `a` is an odd number, `c` is 1, `a` is decremented by 9, and the input value is greater than 1**
