Example Answer:
If `a` is an odd number, `c` becomes 1 and `a` is decremented by 9. If `a` is not in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the result of the expression is `a / 4 + c`. Otherwise, the result is -1. 
Output State: **If `a` is an odd number, `c` becomes 1 and `a` is decremented by 9. If `a` is not in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the result is `a / 4 + c`. Otherwise, the result is -1.**
