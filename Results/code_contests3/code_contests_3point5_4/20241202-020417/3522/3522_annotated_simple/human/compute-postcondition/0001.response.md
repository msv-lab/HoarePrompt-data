Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Each query input `ni` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 1; `a` is an input value.
Output State: **Each query input `ni` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 1; `a` is an input value**
