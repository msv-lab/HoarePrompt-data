Output State: **At the end of the loop, if the loop executes, 'c' will be either 0 or 1 based on whether 'a' is odd or not. If 'a' is odd, 'a' will be decremented by 9. The code will print -1 if 'a' is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, otherwise it will print 'a' divided by 4 plus the value of 'c'. If the loop does not execute, the values of 'a' and 'c' will be the last values assigned to them in the loop.**
