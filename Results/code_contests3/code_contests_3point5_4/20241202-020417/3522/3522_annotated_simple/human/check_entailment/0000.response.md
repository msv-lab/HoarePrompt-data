Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through each query, checks if the input number is odd, decrements it by 9 if it is odd, and then checks if the number is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If it is, it prints -1 as there are no valid splittings. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible number of summands by dividing the number by 4 and adding the value of 'c' (which is either 0 or 1 based on whether the original number was odd or not). This logic correctly determines the maximum possible number of composite summands for each query, as required by the problem description.
