The function does not accept any parameters and iterates over a range of inputs. For each input 'a', it checks if 'a' is odd and decrements it by 9 if so. Then, it prints -1 if 'a' is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, otherwise it prints 'a' divided by 4 plus 1 if 'a' was odd and 0 otherwise. The function assumes each query input 'ni' is a positive integer greater than 1.
