Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program first takes the number of queries as input.
- Then for each query, it takes the integer as input.
- It then initializes a counter variable c to 0.
- If the input number is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and increments the counter c by 1.
- It then checks if the resulting number is one of the prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and prints -1 if it is.
- Otherwise, it divides the number by 4 and adds the value of c to it, then prints the result.
- The program correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output.
