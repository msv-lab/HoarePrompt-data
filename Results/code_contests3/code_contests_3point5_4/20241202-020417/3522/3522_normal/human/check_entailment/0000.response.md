Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the program should represent the given number as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. However, the code provided does not handle all cases correctly.

For example, if we take the input 8, the code will output 2 as the maximum possible number of summands, which is incorrect. The correct output should be -1, as 8 cannot be split into composite summands.

Therefore, based on this example and the problem description, the code is incorrect.
