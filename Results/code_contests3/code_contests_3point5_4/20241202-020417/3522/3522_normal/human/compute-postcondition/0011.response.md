Example Answer:
`a` is reassigned the value of `a` minus 9. The value of `a` is initially assigned the user input value, and now it is decreased by 9. The value of `c` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the user input value minus 9, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is the user input value minus 9, `c` is 0**
