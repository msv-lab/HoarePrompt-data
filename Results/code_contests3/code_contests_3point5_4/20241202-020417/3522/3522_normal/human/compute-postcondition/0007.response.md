Example Answer:
If a is a positive integer, we check if a is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, we print -1. If not, we calculate a divided by 4 plus c. If a % 2 != 0, a becomes 9 less than its previous value and c is set to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: a is a positive integer, c is 1.
Output State: **a is a positive integer, c is 1**
