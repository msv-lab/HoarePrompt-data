According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of the `input()` function. If the input returns a positive integer, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to indicate that the input is a positive integer. 
State: **for the loop to execute, the result of `input()` is a positive integer**
