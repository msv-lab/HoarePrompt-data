Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the user input value. If `a` is odd, then `a` is updated to be the user input value minus 9, and `c` is updated to 1. If `a` is even, there is no change in the values of `a` and `c`. 
The code then checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If `a` is in the set, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`.
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated based on input being odd or even, `c` is updated based on input being odd or even, and the resulting print statement is determined based on the conditions.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on input being odd or even, `c` is updated based on input being odd or even, and the resulting print statement is determined based on the conditions**
