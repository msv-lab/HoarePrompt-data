Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value 1. The value of `c` is now 1. The value of `a` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer that is 9 less than its previous value, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer that is 9 less than its previous value, `c` is 1**
