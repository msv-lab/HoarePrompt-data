Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, it will be updated accordingly, and `c` will be set to 1. The loop will execute again if the input value is greater than 1. If `a` is even, no changes will be made, and `c` will remain 0. The print statement will output -1 if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise, it will output the result of `a / 4 + c`.
Output State: **`a` is updated based on input being odd or even, `c` is set to 1 if `a` is odd, print statement outputs -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it outputs `a / 4 + c`**
