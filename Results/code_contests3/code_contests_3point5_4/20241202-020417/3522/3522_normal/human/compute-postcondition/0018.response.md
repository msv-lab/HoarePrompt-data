Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting 9. The loop will execute again if the input value is greater than 1. The initial state of `a` is based on input being odd or even. The value of `c` is initialized to 0. 
Output State: **`a` is updated based on input being odd or even, `c` is initialized to 0. The loop will execute again if the input value is greater than 1**
