Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It iterates over the user-provided inputs, updates the value of `a` based on the input, sets `c` to 1 if the updated `a` is odd, then prints either -1 if the updated `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), or the updated `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.**
