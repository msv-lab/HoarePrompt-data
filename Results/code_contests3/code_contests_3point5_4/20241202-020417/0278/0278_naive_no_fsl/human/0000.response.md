Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the provided ingredients and proportions, and outputs the result with the required precision. The program uses lambda functions and the reduce function to efficiently compute the result. 

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and for every valid input, it produces the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
