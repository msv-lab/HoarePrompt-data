Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func` that reads the input values for `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`. It then performs the necessary calculations involving the proportions of ingredients and the available amounts of ingredients to determine the volume of soup that can be cooked. Finally, it prints the result, which is the volume of soup that can be cooked by Volodya.

The program correctly follows the problem description as it calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given input values of proportions of ingredients and available amounts of ingredients. It considers all possible cases and provides the correct output within the required relative or absolute error limit.
