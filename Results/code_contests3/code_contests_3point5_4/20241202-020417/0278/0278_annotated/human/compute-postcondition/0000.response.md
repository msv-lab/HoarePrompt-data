Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values by mapping them to integers after splitting the raw input. The values of `n` and `V` are determined by the input given during execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are assigned integer values based on the input.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are assigned integer values based on the input**
