Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of float values based on the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Similarly, `b` is also assigned a list of float values based on the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are assigned integer values, `a` is a list of float values based on input, `b` is a list of float values based on input**
