Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input values for n, V, a, and b correctly. It then calculates the total volume of soup that Volodya can cook based on the given proportions of ingredients and the available amounts of ingredients. The program uses the reduce function to iteratively calculate the minimum proportion of ingredients that limits the soup volume, and then multiplies it by the corresponding amount of that ingredient to get the total volume of soup. The program returns the minimum value between the calculated soup volume and V, ensuring that Volodya does not cook more soup than the capacity of the pan. The logic seems correct and the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
