Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values based on the input received from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `n` and `V` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000.
Output State: **n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000**
