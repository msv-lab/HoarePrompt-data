Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of float values obtained from the user input after splitting. Similarly, `b` is assigned a list of float values obtained from the user input after splitting. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `a` is a list of float values, `b` is a list of float values.
Output State: **n and V are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000, `a` is a list of float values, `b` is a list of float values**
