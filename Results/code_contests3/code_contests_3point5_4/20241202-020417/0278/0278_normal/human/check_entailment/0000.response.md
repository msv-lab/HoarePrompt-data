Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately follow the problem description for all potential cases. The code snippet is quite complex and difficult to understand at first glance. It involves the use of lambda functions, reduce, and zip to perform calculations based on the input values `a` and `b`. This complexity makes it challenging to verify the correctness of the code.

One potential issue with the code is that it may not handle cases where the volume of soup cooked exceeds the given volume `V`. The calculations performed in the code are not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

Additionally, the output hints suggest that the code is incomplete and lacks clarity in terms of the actual calculation process. There are potential edge cases related to the input constraints that should be considered to fully understand the functionality of the function.

Without a clear understanding of the code logic and its ability to handle all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, it is difficult to confirm the correctness of the code.
