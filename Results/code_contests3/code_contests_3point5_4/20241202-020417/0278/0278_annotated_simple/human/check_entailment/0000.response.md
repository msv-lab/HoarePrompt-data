Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values, calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked based on the ingredients available and the proportions, and outputs the result. The program uses the reduce function to iterate over the ingredients and calculate the minimum volume of soup that can be cooked based on the available ingredients.

The program handles all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem description. It calculates the volume of soup that can be cooked within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
