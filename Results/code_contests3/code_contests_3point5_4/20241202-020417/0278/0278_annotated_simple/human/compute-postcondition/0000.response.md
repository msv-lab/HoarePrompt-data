Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map` and `raw_input()`. Since the values are not provided, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n and V are positive integers. ai and bi are positive integers for 1 <= i <= n.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n and V are positive integers. ai and bi are positive integers for 1 <= i <= n.**
