Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a positive integer `n` as input, calculates the number of digits in `n`, increments it if it's odd, then iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of length `l` (or `l+1` if it was incremented) and checks if the count of '4' is equal to the count of '7'. It then finds the smallest number that meets the conditions and is greater than or equal to `n`, and prints it. This process ensures that the program returns the least super lucky number which is not less than `n`, as required by the problem description.
