Example Answer: 
`ans` will be updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. After execution, `ans` will be updated to the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
