Example Answer: 
`tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` by joining the individual digits of `x`. The value of `tem` is less than `n`, and all the other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`**
