According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `l`, and the range specified in the for loop. If `i` is less than 10 with a step size of 2, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions exist:
`n` is a single-digit positive integer, 
`l` is less than 10, 
`ans` is the minimum value between `tem` and 4444477777, 
`i` is the maximum value within the range based on the step size of 2, 
`tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, 
the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the final value of `tem`, 
and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the range for `i` is specified as starting from `l` and increasing by 2 until 10, `l` should be adjusted to be less than 8 to allow for another iteration.
- `i` should be updated to the next value based on the step size of 2.

State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value between `tem` and 4444477777, `i` is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the final value of `tem`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time**
