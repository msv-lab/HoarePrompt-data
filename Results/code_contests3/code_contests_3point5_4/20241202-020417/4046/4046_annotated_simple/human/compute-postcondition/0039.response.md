Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is greater than 2 and within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is greater than 2 and within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
