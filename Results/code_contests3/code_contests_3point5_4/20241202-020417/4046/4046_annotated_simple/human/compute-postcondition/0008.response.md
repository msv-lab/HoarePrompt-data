Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the string `x`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `x`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`**
