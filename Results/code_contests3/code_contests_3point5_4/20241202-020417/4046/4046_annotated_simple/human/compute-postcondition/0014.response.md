Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining its elements. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, but the specific values of `x` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`**
