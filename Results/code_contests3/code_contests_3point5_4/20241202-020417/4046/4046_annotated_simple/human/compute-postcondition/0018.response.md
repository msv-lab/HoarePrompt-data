According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If the integer representation of `x` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program is in the same state as before with the conditions preserved. For the loop to execute one more time, the integer representation of `x` should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`**
