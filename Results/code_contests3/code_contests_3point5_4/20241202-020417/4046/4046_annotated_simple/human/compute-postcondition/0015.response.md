Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, where `tem` is the integer representation of `x`. The value of `tem` is not specified, but it is compared with `ans` to update `ans` accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`**
