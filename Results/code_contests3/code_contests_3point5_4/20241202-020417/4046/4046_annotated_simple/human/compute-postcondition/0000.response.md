Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, after execution, `n` will hold a positive integer value as well.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer**
