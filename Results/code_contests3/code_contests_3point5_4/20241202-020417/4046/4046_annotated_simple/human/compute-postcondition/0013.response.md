According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`**
