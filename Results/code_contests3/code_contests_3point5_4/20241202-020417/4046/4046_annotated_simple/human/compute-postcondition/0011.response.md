Postcondition: ***`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program updates the value of `ans` to the minimum between 4444477777 and `tem`.***
