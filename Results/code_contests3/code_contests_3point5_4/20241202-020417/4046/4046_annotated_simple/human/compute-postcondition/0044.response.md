According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If the next value within the range based on the step size of 2 is within the product of '74' and repeat of `i`, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, to ensure the loop will execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `n` is a single-digit positive integer
- `l` is less than 8
- `ans` is the minimum value between `tem` and 4444477777
- `i` is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2
- `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`
- The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the final value of `tem`
- `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time

State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 8, `ans` is the minimum value between `tem` and 4444477777, `i` is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the final value of `tem`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time**
