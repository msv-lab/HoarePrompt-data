According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If the loop can execute again, `i` must follow the step size of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is greater than 0 and within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated based on the step size of 2.
State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is greater than 2 and within the range based on the step size of 2, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
