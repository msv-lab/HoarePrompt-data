Postcondition: ***`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then no changes occur to the variables.***
