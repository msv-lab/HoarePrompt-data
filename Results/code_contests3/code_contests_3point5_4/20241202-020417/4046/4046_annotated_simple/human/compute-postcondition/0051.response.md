According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `tem`, and the count of '7' and '4' in the string `x`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: n is a single-digit positive integer, l is less than 8, ans is the minimum value between the updated ans and 4444477777, i is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, tem is greater than or equal to n, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x for the final value of tem, tem is greater than or equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value of the joined string x, and ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the updated tem. 

To execute the loop one more time, i should be updated to the next value within the range based on the step size of 2. Additionally, the conditions related to tem, the count of '7' and '4' in x should be maintained as they are in the updated state.

State: **n is a single-digit positive integer, l is less than 8, ans is the minimum value between the updated ans and 4444477777, i is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, tem is greater than or equal to n, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x for the final value of tem, tem is greater than or equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value of the joined string x, and ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the updated tem**.
