Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is the integer representation of `x` and `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `tem` will be considered for comparison with `ans`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a single-digit positive integer, `l` is less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, `tem` is less than `n`**
