Example Answer:
The string x is joined and converted to an integer, which is then assigned to tem. The previous states of the variables are n is a single-digit positive integer, l is less than 8, ans is the minimum value between the updated ans and 4444477777, i is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, tem is greater than or equal to n, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x for the final value of tem, tem is greater than or equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, and ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the updated tem. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a single-digit positive integer, l is less than 8, ans is the minimum value between the updated ans and 4444477777, i is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, tem is greater than or equal to n, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x for the final value of tem, tem is greater than or equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value of the joined string x, and ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the updated tem.
Output State: **n is a single-digit positive integer, l is less than 8, ans is the minimum value between the updated ans and 4444477777, i is the next value within the range based on the step size of 2, tem is greater than or equal to n, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x for the final value of tem, tem is greater than or equal to n for the loop to execute one more time, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value of the joined string x, and ans is updated to the minimum value between ans and the updated tem**.
