Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the length of the string representation of `n`, and `ans` is assigned the value 4444477777. Since the value of `n` is a positive integer, `l` will be the number of digits in `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the number of digits in `n`, `ans` is 4444477777.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the number of digits in `n`, `ans` is 4444477777**
