Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input integer n and finds the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n. It iterates through all possible lengths of numbers with digits 4 and 7, checks if the number has an equal number of 4s and 7s, and then finds the minimum super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n. The logic implemented in the code correctly follows the problem description and should work for all possible cases.
