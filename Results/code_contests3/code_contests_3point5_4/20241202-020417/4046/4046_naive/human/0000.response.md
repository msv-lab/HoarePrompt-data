Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly follows the problem description and generates the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to the given input number 'n'. The program iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of increasing lengths until it finds a super lucky number greater than or equal to 'n'. The condition to check if the number contains equal amounts of '4' and '7' is also correctly implemented. Additionally, the use of itertools.product to generate all possible combinations of '4' and '7' simplifies the code and ensures correctness. Overall, the program works as intended for all potential cases.
