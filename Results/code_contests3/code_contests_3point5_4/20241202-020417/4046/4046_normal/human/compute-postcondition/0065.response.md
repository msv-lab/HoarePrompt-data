Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, calculates the length of the string representation of `n`, adjusts the length to be even if it's odd, then iterates through a range of even numbers starting from the adjusted length. Within the iteration, it generates combinations of '7' and '4' with the same counts, forms integers from these combinations, and finds the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that meets the '7' and '4' count condition. Finally, it prints the minimum found integer `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.**
