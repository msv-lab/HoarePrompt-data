According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next even number after the previous value. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next even number after the current `i`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the loop finishes executing.**
