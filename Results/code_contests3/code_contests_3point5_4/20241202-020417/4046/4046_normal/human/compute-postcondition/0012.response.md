Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is 4444477777 or the minimum value between 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is an even number, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string formed by joining the elements of list `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the program executes as described.***
