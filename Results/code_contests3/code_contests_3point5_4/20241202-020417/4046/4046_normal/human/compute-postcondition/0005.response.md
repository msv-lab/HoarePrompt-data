According to the code, the loop can execute if `l` is greater than or equal to 10. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is greater than or equal to 10. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10, `ans` is 4444477777, the length of `l` is even for the loop to execute**
