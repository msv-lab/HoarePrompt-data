According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, and `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the loop finishes executing do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `i` is greater than 0 to ensure the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the loop finishes executing, for the loop to execute `i` is greater than 0**
