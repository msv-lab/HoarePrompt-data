According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of `l` to 10 (exclusive) with a step size of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even number after the current value. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- `i` should be updated to the next even number after the current value.
- `tem` should be updated to the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the loop finishes executing.
- The count of '7' should be equal to the count of '4' in list `x`.
- `tem` should be the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`.
- Since the loop has to execute one more time, the loop condition should be met, meaning `i` should still be within the range of `l` to 10 with a step size of 2.
  
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the loop finishes executing, count of '7' is equal to count of '4' in list `x`, and `tem` is the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x` where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to `n`**.
