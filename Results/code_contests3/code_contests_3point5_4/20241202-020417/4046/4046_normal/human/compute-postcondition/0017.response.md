Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the new value of `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the previous value, `tem` is equal to the new integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x`, where `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the program executes as described, otherwise no changes are made to the variables.***
