According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the length of the product of '74' repeated `i` times. Since the length of `l` needs to be even, the loop will execute if `i` is an even number. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `i` is an even number**
