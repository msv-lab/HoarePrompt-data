Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the new value of `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the previous value, `tem` is the new integer formed by joining the elements of list `x`, count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` for the loop to execute one more time. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program continues with the same state as before the if statement.***
