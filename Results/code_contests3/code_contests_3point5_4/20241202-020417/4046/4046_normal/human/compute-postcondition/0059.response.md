Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, l is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, ans is the minimum value between 4444477777 and the smallest integer value formed by joining the elements of list x where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to n, i is the next even number after the current value of i, tem is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list x after the loop finishes executing, count of '7' is equal to count of '4' in list x, tem is the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list x where count of '7' is equal to count of '4' and is greater than or equal to n, x is a list of elements where the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4', for the loop to execute again i must be updated to the next even number after its current value, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list x. If tem is greater than or equal to n, then the program continues with the described initial state.***
