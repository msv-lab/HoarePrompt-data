Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the next iteration, count of '7' is equal to count of '4' in list `x`, and `tem` is updated to the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than or equal to 10 and has an even length, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`, `i` is the next even number after the current value, `tem` is the final integer value formed by joining the elements of list `x` after the next iteration, count of '7' is equal to count of '4' in list `x`, and `tem` is updated to the integer value obtained by joining the elements of list `x` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**.
