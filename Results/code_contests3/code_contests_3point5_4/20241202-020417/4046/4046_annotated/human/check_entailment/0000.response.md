Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads a positive integer `n`, then iterates through combinations of '74' digits of increasing length starting from the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 if it is odd. For each valid combination, it checks if the number formed is greater than or equal to `n`, and if so, updates the minimum found value in `ans`. Finally, the program prints the minimum valid number stored in `ans`.

This process ensures that the program finds the least super lucky number that is not less than `n`, as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
