Postcondition: ***The program variables `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are in their respective initial states as described in the precondition. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program will proceed with the postcondition where all the variables retain their initial values.***
