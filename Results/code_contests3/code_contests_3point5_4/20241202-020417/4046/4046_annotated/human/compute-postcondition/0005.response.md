According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. The loop will execute as long as the range starts from an odd number greater than or equal to `l` and ends before 10. Since `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), we need to adjust the state such that `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to `l` and less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` remains 4444477777, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to `l` and less than 10**
