Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is not given, but it is greater than or equal to `n`, so `ans` will be updated to the minimum between the current `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the new `ans` will be `tem`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 2 (odd number), `ans` is now equal to `tem`, `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and all conditions for the loop to execute one more time are satisfied after the execution of the if statement.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 2 (odd number), `ans` is now equal to `tem`, `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and all conditions for the loop to execute one more time are satisfied after the execution of the if statement.**
