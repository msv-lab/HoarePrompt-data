Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining all its elements. The previous values of `x` are not provided, so the output state is: `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` is increased by 1, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers with their respective initial values.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` is increased by 1, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers with their respective initial values**
