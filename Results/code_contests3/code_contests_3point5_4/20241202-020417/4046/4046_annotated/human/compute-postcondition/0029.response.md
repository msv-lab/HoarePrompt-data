Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. Since `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the minimum value among all the `tem` values calculated during the loop execution is updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the updated minimum value, `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the updated minimum value, `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
