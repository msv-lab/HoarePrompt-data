According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers with their respective initial values. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` is increased by 1, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers with their respective initial values**
