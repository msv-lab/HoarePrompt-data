Example Answer:
The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 4 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value among all `tem` values calculated during the loop execution, `i` is 2, number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and after entering the if condition, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 4 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value among all `tem` values calculated during the loop execution, `i` is 2, number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and after entering the if condition, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
