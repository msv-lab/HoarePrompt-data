Example Answer: 
`tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`. The value of `tem` is calculated by joining the individual characters in `x` and converting the result to an integer. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
