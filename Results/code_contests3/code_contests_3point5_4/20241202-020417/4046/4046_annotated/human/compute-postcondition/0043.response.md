According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 2 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value among all `tem` values calculated during the loop execution, `i` is 9, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 2, and `l` should be updated accordingly to maintain its odd value.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 4 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value among all `tem` values calculated during the loop execution, `i` is 11, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the new concatenated string `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
