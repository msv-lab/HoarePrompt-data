Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` holds the minimum value among all valid `tem` values calculated during the loop execution. Since there is no loop or calculation of `tem` values provided in the code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` are positive integers**
