Output State: **`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` are positive integers. If the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater or equal to `n`, then `n`, `l`, `i` are increased by 1 for each iteration of the loop, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the minimum value among all valid `tem` values calculated during the loop execution.**
