Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` remains 4444477777, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to `l` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string `x`. Additionally, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
