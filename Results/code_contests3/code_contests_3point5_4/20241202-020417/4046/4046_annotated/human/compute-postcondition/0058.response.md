Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The values of `ans` and `tem` are positive integers. The output state will depend on the comparison between `ans` and `tem`. 
Output State: **`n`, `l`, `i` is increased by 1, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers with their respective initial values, `ans` is the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`**
