Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i` are positive integers. If the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater or equal to `n`, then `n`, `l`, `i` are increased by 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
