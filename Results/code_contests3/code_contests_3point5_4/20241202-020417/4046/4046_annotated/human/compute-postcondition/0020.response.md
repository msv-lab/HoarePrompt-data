Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `tem`. No information is provided about the previous values of `ans` and `tem`, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is the length of the string representation of `n` increased by 1 (odd number), `ans` is the minimum value between the previous value of `ans` and `tem`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the next odd number greater than the current `i` and less than 10, the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
