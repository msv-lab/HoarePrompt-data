Postcondition: ***`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, number of occurrences of '7' in `x`, `tem` are positive integers and have their respective initial values as described in the precondition. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, after executing the if statement where the number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, all variables will retain their initial values.***
