The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates a value `x` based on the square root of `n`, and then determines the value of `answr` based on different conditions. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` is set to `4 * sqrt(n)`. If `x` is not a square root of `n`, and if `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`. If `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`. The final value of `answr` is printed as an integer. The function does not explicitly return any value.
