Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the integer value of `answr`. The value of `answr` would have been calculated based on the conditions provided for `x` and `n`, but since the initial values of `N` and `x` are not provided, the exact value of `answr` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: *`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * sqrt(n)`. If `x` is not a square root of `n`, and if x * (x + 1) > n, then `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, then `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * sqrt(n)`. If `x` is not a square root of `n`, and if x * (x + 1) > n, then `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, then `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).**
