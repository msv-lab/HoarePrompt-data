Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which simplifies to `4x + 2`. Since the product of `x` and `(x + 1)` is greater than `n`, the value of `x` must be such that `4x + 2` is also greater than `n`. The specific values of `N` and `x` are not provided, so the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. x is not a square root of n. The product of x and (x + 1) is greater than n, and `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. x is not a square root of n. The product of x and (x + 1) is greater than n, and `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2**
