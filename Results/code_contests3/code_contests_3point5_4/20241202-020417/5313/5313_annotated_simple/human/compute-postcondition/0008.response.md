Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where x is not a square root of n. Therefore, the value of `answr` is 4 times the value of x + 1. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. x is not a square root of n. (x * (x + 1) ≤ n); `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
