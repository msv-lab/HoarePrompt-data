Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * sqrt(n)`. If `x` is not a square root of `n`, and if x * (x + 1) > n, then `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, then `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1).***
