Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the square root of `n`, calculated using the exponentiation operator `**`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 106, the square root of `n` will be an integer as well. Therefore, `x` is an integer. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer**
