Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `x` can be the square root of `n`. Therefore, `answr` is equal to `4 * sqrt(n)`. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106; `x` is an integer. The square of `x` is equal to `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * sqrt(n)`**
