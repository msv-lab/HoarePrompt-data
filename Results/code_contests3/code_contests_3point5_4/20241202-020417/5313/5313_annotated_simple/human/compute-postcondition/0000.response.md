Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is dependent on the user input within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 106**
