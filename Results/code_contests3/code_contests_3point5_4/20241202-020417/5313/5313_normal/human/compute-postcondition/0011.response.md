Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is converted to an integer. The value of `answr` could be in any of the three cases mentioned in the initial state based on the value of `n` and `x`. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n. If x^2 is equal to n, the function returns 4 times the square root of n. Otherwise, if x * (x + 1) > n, the answer is (x + x + 1) * 2. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, the answer is 4 * (x + 1). `answr` is an integer value based on the conditions.
