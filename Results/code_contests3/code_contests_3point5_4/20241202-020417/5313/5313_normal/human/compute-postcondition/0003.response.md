Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x` multiplied by 4. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and `n` is a perfect square, `x` is the square root of `n`. Therefore, `answr` is equal to 4 times the square root of `n`. 
Output State: **`answr` is 4 times the square root of `n`**
