Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, the square root of `n` will also be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
