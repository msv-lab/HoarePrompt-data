Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where x is the integer square root of n. Since x^2 is not equal to n and x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, the value of x would satisfy these conditions. Therefore, the value of answr would be 4 * (x + 1) based on the calculated value of x. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `x^2` is not equal to `n`, `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, and `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1)**
