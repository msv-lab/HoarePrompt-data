Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n`, `x^2` is not equal to `n`, and the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, the value of `x` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, x^2 is not equal to n, the product of x and x+1 is greater than n, and answr is calculated as described.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is the integer square root of n, x^2 is not equal to n, the product of x and x+1 is greater than n, and answr is (x + x + 1) * 2**
