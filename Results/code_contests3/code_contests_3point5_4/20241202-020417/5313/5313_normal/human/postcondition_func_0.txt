The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the square root of `n`, and based on certain conditions, it determines a value for the variable `answr`. If the square of the calculated square root is equal to `n`, it assigns `4 * x` to `answr`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it assigns `(x + x + 1) * 2` to `answr`. If `x * (x + 1) <= n`, it assigns `4 * (x + 1)` to `answr`. Finally, it prints the integer value of `answr`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value.
