Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes an integer input `n`, calculates the square root of `n`, and based on certain conditions, determines the minimum perimeter that can be achieved. 
- If the square of the calculated square root is equal to `n`, it assigns `4 * x` to `answr`. This case covers when the area is a perfect square, so the minimum perimeter would be 4 times the square root of `n`.
- If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it assigns `(x + x + 1) * 2` to `answr`. This case covers when the area falls between two consecutive square numbers, so the minimum perimeter would be the sum of two consecutive numbers times 2.
- If `x * (x + 1) <= n`, it assigns `4 * (x + 1)` to `answr`. This case covers when the area is greater than the product of two consecutive numbers, so the minimum perimeter would be 4 times the next consecutive number after the square root of `n`.
- The code outputs the integer value of `answr` as the final result.
- The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
