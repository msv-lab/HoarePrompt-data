Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes an input integer `N`, calculates the square root of `N`, and then determines the minimum perimeter based on certain conditions. The final result is printed as an integer. The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
