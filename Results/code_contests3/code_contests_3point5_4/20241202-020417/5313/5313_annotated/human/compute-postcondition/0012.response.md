Example Answer: 
The code snippet `print(answr)` will output the value stored in the variable `answr`. The initial state provides that `answr` is an integer, however, the specific value of `answr` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, x is the square root of N, n is equal to N, answr is an integer and the value of `answr` is printed.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, x is the square root of N, n is equal to N, answr is an integer and the value of `answr` is printed**
