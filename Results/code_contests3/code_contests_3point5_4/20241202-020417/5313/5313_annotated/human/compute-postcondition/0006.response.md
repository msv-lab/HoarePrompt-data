Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `n` and the square of `x` is not equal to `n`, and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`. Since we know `x` is the square root of `n` and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, we can calculate the value of `answr`. 
Output State: **`answr` is the result of `(x + x + 1) * 2` where `x` is the square root of `n` and the square of `x` is not equal to `n`, and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`**.
