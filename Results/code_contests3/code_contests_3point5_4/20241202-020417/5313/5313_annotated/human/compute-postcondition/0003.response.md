Example Answer:
`x` is the square root of `n`, and the square of `x` is equal to `n`, so `x` is a perfect square. `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`, so `answr` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is equal to N, `x` is the square root of N, `answr` is equal to N.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `n` is equal to N, `x` is the square root of N, `answr` is equal to N**
