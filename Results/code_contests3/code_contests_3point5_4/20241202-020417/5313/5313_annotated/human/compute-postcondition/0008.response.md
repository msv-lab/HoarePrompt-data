Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where x is the square root of n. Since the square of x is not equal to n and x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, the value of answr will depend on the value of x. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; n is now assigned the value of N, x is the square root of n, the square of x is not equal to n, x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, and answr is 4 * (x + 1).
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; n is now assigned the value of N, x is the square root of n, the square of x is not equal to n, x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to n, and answr is 4 * (x + 1)**
