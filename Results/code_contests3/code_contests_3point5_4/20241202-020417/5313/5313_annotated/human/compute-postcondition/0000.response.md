Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` is unknown, but after execution, `n` will hold the value of `N`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is now assigned the value of N.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is now assigned the value of N**
