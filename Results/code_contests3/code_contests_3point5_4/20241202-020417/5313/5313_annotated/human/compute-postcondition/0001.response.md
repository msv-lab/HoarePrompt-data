Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the square root of `n` as an integer. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, the square root of `n` will also be an integer. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is now assigned the value of N, `x` is the square root of `n`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6; `n` is now assigned the value of N, `x` is the square root of `n`**
