Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved based on the input number of city blocks. It considers all possible shapes and calculates the perimeter accordingly. The logic used in the program is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program handles the scenarios where the square of a number equals the input, where the product of two consecutive numbers is greater than the input, and the default case where the input falls between two consecutive squares. Therefore, the program is correct and provides the expected output for all possible cases.
