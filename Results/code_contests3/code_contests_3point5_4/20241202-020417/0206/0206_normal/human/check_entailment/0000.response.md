Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code reads the input incorrectly using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. Additionally, the code is missing the import statement for numpy library, so the code will result in errors. The code does not calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as required by the problem description. The code needs to be revised to correctly calculate the minimum distance based on the given constraints and input format.
