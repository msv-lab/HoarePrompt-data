Example Answer:
N is assigned the value raw_input(), where raw_input() accepts an input as a string. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
