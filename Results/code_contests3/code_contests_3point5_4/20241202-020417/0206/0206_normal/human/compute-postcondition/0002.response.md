Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`. As no specific values are given for the elements in array `a`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, ans is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a`**
