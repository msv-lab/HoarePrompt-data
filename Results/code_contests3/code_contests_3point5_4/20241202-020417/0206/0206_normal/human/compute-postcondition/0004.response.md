The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to return the maximum value among a list of integers. The list is of length N, where N is a positive integer. Each element a_i in the list is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N. The function should return the maximum value present in the list of integers. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the maximum value among a list of integers with length N, where each element is an integer between 0 and 1000.**
