Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input split into a list. Since the input values are integers ranging from 0 to 1000, the list `a` contains N integers within this range. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N**
