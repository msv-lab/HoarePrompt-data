Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`. The initial state does not provide the values of the array elements, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, ans is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a`.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer, and 0 <= a_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, ans is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a`**
