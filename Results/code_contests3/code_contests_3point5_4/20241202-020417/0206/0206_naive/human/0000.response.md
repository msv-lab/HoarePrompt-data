Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the input conversion properly. The input is read using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python. The correct function to use is `input()`. Additionally, the program is trying to use `np.abs()` function without importing numpy library which will result in an error. Hence, the program will not work as expected for any input and thus the correctness is false.
