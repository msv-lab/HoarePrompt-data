Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the user input after splitting it based on whitespaces. Since `N` is a string entered by the user, `a` will be a list of strings after splitting. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a string entered by the user, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **N is a string entered by the user, `a` is a list of strings**
