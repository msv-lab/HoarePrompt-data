Example Answer:
`ans` holds the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`. The code snippet only prints the value of `ans`. The initial state is N is a string entered by the user, `a` is a list of strings, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`. 
Output State: **N is a string entered by the user, `a` is a list of strings, `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in list `a`**
