Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program does not accept the input format specified in the problem description. Instead of reading the input in the specified format, it reads the input using `raw_input()` and splits the input values.
2. The program uses `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` without importing the necessary numpy library. This will result in a NameError when executed.
3. The program calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input array, which is not the same as finding the minimum distance to be traveled as required in the problem description.
4. The program does not consider the requirement of AtCoDeer being able to start and end his travel at any positions.
