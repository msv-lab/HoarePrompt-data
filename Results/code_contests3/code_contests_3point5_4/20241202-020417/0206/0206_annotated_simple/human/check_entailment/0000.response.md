Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
1. The program is missing the necessary import statement for numpy library.
2. The program reads input using `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.
3. The program calculates the minimum distance incorrectly. It should calculate the minimum distance between the minimum and maximum coordinates of the houses, not just the absolute difference between them. 

Overall, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and needs to be corrected.
