Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`. The variables `N` and `a_i` are not directly affected by this operation. 
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N, ans is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a`**
