Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` reads a line from input and `split()` splits the line into a list of strings. The values of `N` and `a_i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_i is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N**
