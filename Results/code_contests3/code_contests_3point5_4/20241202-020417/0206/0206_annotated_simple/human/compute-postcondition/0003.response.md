Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`. The initial state provides that `N` is a positive integer and `a_i` is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N. The code snippet does not directly affect the initial state variables, but it calculates and prints the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a`. 
Output State: **No change in initial state. The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in array `a` is printed.**
