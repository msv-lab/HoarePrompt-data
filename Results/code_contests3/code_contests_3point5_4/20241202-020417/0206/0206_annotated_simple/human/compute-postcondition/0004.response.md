The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the constraints mentioned above. The function takes in a positive integer `N` representing the number of elements to be processed, and a list of integers `a_i` for each i where 1 <= i <= N. The function processes these integers according to a specific logic or requirement based on the problem statement. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It processes a positive integer N and a list of integers a_i for each i where 1 <= i <= N, based on a specific logic or requirement.**
