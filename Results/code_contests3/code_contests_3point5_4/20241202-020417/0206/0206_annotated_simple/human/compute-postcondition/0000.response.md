Example Answer:
`N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` reads a string input. The variables `N` and `a_i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer and a_i is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer and a_i is an integer for each i where 1 <= i <= N**
