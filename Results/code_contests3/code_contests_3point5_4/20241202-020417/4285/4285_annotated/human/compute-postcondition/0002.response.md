The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, the program returns an error due to the invalid operation of comparing a variable 'x' with its reverse 'x[::-1]'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return an error message for the invalid operation of comparing a variable with its reverse.
