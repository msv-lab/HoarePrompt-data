The function accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it to a string, keeping only the alphabetic characters in lowercase. It then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, returning True if it is and False if it is not. Missing functionality includes handling cases where `n` is not a palindrome, but the provided annotations suggest otherwise.
