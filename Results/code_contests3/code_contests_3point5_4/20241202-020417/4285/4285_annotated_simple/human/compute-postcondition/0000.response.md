Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to iterate over the characters of the integer `n` which is not possible as `n` is an integer. Therefore, the code will throw an error. Since the code cannot be executed, the state remains the same.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000**
