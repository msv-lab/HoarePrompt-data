#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000.**
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the positive integer 'n' is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it to a string, keeping only the alphabetic characters in lowercase. It then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, returning True if it is and False if it is not. Missing functionality includes handling cases where `n` is not a palindrome, but the provided annotations suggest otherwise.
