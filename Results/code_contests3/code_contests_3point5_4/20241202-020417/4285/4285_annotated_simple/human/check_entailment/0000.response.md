Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` is checking if the input integer `n` is a palindrome, which is not the requirement of the problem. The program should output the n-th even-length palindrome number, not check if a given number is a palindrome.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and hence the correctness is False.
