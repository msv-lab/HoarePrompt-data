Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description. The function `func_1` is checking if a string containing only lowercase alphabetical characters is a palindrome, not finding the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. The output hints also do not agree with the code as they describe a different functionality. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
