The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and converts it to a string, keeping only the alphabetical characters in lowercase. It then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and returns True if it is, otherwise it returns False. Note that if n contains no alphabetical characters, the function will always return True since an empty string is considered a palindrome.
