Example Answer:
The code snippet tries to iterate over the characters of the integer `n`, but since `n` is a positive integer, it cannot be directly iterated over as a string. Therefore, the code will raise an error. The initial state remains unchanged.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000.**
