Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input integer and uses it as an index to access a specific element from a hardcoded list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. It then prints out the element at that index.

Since the program directly maps the input integer to the corresponding element in the list, it always outputs the correct integer as per the problem description. The program is correct for all possible inputs within the given range (0 ≤ a ≤ 15).
