Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value from the list based on the input provided. The input is taken using `raw_input()` and converted to an integer, which is then used as an index to access the corresponding value from the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `a`, the output state will depend on the input given during execution.
Output State: **Output will be the value from the list based on the input provided.**
