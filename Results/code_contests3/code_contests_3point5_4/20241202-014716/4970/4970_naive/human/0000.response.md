Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes an integer input (a) and then uses it as an index to access a specific element from a list containing integers [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The accessed element is then printed as the output. Since the input value (a) is used as an index to directly access the required element from the list, the program follows the problem description correctly for all potential cases (0 to 15 inclusive). There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
