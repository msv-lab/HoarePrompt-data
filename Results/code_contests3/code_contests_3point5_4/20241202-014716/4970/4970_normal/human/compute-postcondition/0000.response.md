Example Answer:
The code snippet is trying to access an element from a list based on the input provided. The input is converted to an integer using `int(raw_input())`, and then the corresponding element from the list is printed. As the input is constrained to be between 0 and 15 and the list has 16 elements, the output would be the element at the index provided by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15 and the corresponding element from the list is printed based on the input.
Output State: **a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15 and the corresponding element from the list is printed based on the input**
