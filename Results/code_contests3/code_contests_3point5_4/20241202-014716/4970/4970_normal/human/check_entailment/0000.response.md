Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code prompts the user to input an integer and then prints the corresponding element from a predefined list. The code directly follows the problem description as it takes a single integer as input and outputs a single integer based on the input value. The code handles all possible input values from 0 to 15 and returns the correct output. The output hints also confirm that the function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value, which aligns with the code implementation. Thus, the code is correct in this case.
