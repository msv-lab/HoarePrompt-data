Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func` that takes no parameters and prints a value from a predefined list based on the user input. The user input is used as an index to access a value from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This matches the problem description, where the input should be used as an index to retrieve a value.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and always returns the correct value based on the user input.
