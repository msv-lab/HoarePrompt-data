Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value from the list based on the input given by the user. The input is taken using `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer. The input value determines the index of the element to be printed from the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `a`, the final output state will depend on the user input.
Output State: **Dependent on the user input for the variable `a` and the corresponding value from the list will be printed.**
