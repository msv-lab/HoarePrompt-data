Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prints a value from a predefined list based on the user input. The user input is used as an index to access a value from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The function does not have any specific functionality other than returning a value based on the user input.**
