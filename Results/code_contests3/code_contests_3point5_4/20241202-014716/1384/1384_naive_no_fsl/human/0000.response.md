Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing the total hours studied in World B by the time multiplier X. The input values are converted to float to accommodate division. The program handles all potential cases where T and X are integers within the given constraints. The output format also matches the expected format. Since the program follows the problem description for every potential case, it is considered correct.
