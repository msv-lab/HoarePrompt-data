Example Answer:
t and x are assigned the values returned by map(float, input().split()). The map function applies float conversion to each element of the input split by space. If the input is "3.5 2.7", t will be 3.5 and x will be 2.7. Therefore, the Output State is: t is a float, x is a float.
Output State: **t is a float, x is a float**
