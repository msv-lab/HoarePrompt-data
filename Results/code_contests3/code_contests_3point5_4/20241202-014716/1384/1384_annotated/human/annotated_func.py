#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the user input, divides `t` by `x`, and prints the result. The function does not accept any explicit parameters and does not have a return value.
