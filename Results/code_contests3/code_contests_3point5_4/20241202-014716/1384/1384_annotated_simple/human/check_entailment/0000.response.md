Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integer inputs T and X, converts them to floats, calculates T / X, and prints the result. This matches the requirement of finding out how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output.
