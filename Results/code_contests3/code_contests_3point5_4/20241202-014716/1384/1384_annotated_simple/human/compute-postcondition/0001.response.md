Example Answer: 
The code snippet calculates the result of the division of T by X and prints it. Since T and X are integers with values between 1 and 100, the result of the division could be a floating-point number. Therefore, the Output State is: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.
Output State: **T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100**
