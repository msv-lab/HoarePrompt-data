Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the values of `float(input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts inputs separated by spaces and `float` converts them to floating-point numbers. The values of `t` and `x` are unknown, but they are converted to float. Therefore, the Output State is: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100.
Output State: **T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100**
