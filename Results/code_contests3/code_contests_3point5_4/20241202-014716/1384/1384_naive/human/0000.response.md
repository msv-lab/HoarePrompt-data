Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers as input, representing the number of hours Taro needs to study and the speed at which time passes in World B compared to World A. It then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X. Since the input values are guaranteed to be integers, the division will always result in a floating-point number, which is the expected output. The program handles this calculation correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
