Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two floating-point numbers `t` and `x` from the input and correctly divides `t` by `x` to calculate the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. 
- The code handles all potential cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ T ≤ 100, 1 ≤ X ≤ 100) and provides the expected output for each case. 
- There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code would not work as expected based on the problem description. 
- The output hints also confirm that the code simply performs the division operation and prints the result, which matches the problem description.
