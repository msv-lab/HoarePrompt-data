Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. The code is incorrectly calculating the maximum possible number x. The logic used in the code is flawed and does not align with the problem requirements. The output hints do not provide any edge cases where the code fails, but upon analysis, it is evident that the code does not meet the specified conditions outlined in the problem description. The code needs to be revised to accurately determine the maximum possible number x based on the provided input parameters.
