Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum value between `b` and `c` divided by the minimum value between `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are determined by the input. After execution, `x` will hold the calculated value. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input, and `x` holds the result of the calculation.
Output State: **The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input, and `x` holds the result of the calculation**
