Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `b` and `c` are updated from the input. The initial values of `a` and `n` are not impacted by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `n` remain integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, and `x` is updated based on the new values of `b` and `c`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` remain integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, and `x` is updated based on the new values of `b` and `c**`.
