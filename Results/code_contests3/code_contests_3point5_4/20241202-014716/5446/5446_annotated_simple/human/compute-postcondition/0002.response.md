Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))` and prints it. The values of `b`, `c`, and `x` are updated from the input, and `n` remains an integer within the specified range. The output state will depend on the specific values of `b`, `c`, `n`, and `x` after the input is provided.
Output State: **The output state will depend on the specific values of `b`, `c`, `n`, and `x` after the input is provided.**
