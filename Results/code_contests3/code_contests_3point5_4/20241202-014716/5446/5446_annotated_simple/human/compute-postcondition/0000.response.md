Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values from the input after splitting. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input**
