Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. 

1. The program uses variables `b` and `c` instead of the correct variables `a` and `b`.
2. The calculation of variable `x` is incorrect as it is dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, instead of finding the maximum possible number x as per the problem description.
3. The final calculation to print the result is also incorrect as it is not calculating the maximum possible number x as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as required by the problem description.
