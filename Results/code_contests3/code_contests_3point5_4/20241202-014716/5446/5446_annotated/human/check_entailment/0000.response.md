Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The program is supposed to calculate the maximum possible number x such that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake. However, the program is calculating a different value based on the input. 

The program calculates x using the formula `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` and then calculates the result using another formula which is not in line with the problem description. Additionally, the program uses the `ceil` function which is not imported in the code.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
