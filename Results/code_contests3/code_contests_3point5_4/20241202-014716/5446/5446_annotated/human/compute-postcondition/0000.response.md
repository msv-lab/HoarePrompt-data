Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The `raw_input().split()` function takes input and splits it into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers using list comprehension. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
