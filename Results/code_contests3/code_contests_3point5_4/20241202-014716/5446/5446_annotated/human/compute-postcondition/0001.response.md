Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as the maximum of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Since `b` and `c` are input integers, the value of `x` will be the result of this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; `x` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; `x` is the result of the calculation**
