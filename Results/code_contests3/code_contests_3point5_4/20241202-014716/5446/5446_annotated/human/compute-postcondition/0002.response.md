Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of `(min(b, c) / n) * x`, rounds it up to the nearest integer using `ceil`, and then converts it to an integer using `int`. The values of `n`, `b`, `c`, and `x` are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, `c` are input integers; `x` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are input integers; `x` is the result of the calculation**
