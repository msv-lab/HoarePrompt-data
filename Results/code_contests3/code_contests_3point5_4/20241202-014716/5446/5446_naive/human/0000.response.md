Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible number x as required by the problem description. The issue lies in the calculation of x using the formula max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)), which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of pieces on each plate. Additionally, the usage of functions like "raw_input()" and "ceil()" are not defined in the program.

An example input where the program fails to produce the correct output:
Input:
4 7 10

Expected Output:
3

For the input (4, 7, 10), the correct output should be 3, but the program does not provide the accurate result.
