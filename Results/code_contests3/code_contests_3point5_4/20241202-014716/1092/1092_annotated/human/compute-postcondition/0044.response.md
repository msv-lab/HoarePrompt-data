Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`. `l` must have at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, and `s` is incremented by the total number of uppercase strings in `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by the total number of uppercase strings in `i`.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by the total number of uppercase strings in `i`**
