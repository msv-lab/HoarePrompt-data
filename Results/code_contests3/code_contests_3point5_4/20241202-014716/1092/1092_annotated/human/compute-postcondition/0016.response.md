Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `s` and the current value of `m`. The previous values of `m`, `l`, `i`, and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`**
