Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `0`. The variables `m` and `l` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`; for the loop to execute again, `l` must have more elements.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`; for the loop to execute again, `l` must have more elements**
