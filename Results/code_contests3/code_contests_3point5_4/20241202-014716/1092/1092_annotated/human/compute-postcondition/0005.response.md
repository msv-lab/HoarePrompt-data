According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is the first element in the list `l`, it is already set. The loop can execute if `i` is not an empty string. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0 and `s` is 0. To ensure the loop can execute, `s` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 1 for the loop to execute**
