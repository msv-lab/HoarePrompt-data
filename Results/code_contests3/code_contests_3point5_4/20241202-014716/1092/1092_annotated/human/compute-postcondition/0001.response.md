Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the value `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts user input as a string and `split()` splits the string based on whitespace. The content of the user input is unknown, so the output state is: `l` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`l` is a list of strings**
