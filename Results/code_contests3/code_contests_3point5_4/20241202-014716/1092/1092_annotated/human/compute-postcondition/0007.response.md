Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 2 for the loop to execute, the element `j` is an uppercase letter.
Output State: **`m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 2 for the loop to execute, the element `j` is an uppercase letter**
