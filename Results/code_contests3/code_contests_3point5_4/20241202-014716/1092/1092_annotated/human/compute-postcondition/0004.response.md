Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l`, `s` is 0**
