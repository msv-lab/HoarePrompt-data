Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so after execution, `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` has at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is an iterable object with more elements.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` has at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is an iterable object with more elements**
