Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so after execution, `s` is increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the second time `i` is an iterable object.
