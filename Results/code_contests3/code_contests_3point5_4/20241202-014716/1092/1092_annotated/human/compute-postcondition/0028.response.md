Postcondition: ***`m`, `l`, `s`, and `i` are variables. If `j` is in uppercase, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have even more elements for the loop to execute again, `j` is a string in uppercase, `s` is one greater than before, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must still have elements, and `s` is increased by 1.***
