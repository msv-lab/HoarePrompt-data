Postcondition: ***`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` has at least one element, `j` is an uppercase string, `s` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `i` is an iterable object with more elements. If `j` is uppercase, the program will update `m` to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` will have at least one element, `j` will remain an uppercase string, `s` will be incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the third time `i` must be an iterable object with more elements.***
