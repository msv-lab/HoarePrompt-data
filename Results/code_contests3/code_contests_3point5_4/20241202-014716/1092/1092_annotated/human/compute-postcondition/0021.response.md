Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown. The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`. `l` must have more elements for the loop to execute again. `j` is a string and it is in uppercase. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have more elements for the loop to execute again, `j` is a string and it is in uppercase.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have more elements for the loop to execute again, `j` is a string and it is in uppercase.**
