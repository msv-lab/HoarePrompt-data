Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so the new value of `s` will be one greater. The value of `m` is updated to the maximum between the new value of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The elements of `l` are not specified, but there must be enough elements for the loop to execute again. `j` remains a string in uppercase. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have even more elements for the loop to execute again, `j` is a string in uppercase, `s` is one greater than before.
Output State: **`m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` must have even more elements for the loop to execute again, `j` is a string in uppercase, `s` is one greater than before**.
