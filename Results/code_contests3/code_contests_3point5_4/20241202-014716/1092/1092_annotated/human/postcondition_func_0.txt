Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the length of the text, followed by a text of single-space separated words `s1, s2, ..., si`. It then calculates the maximum count of uppercase letters in any string within the input text and prints this count. The function does not return any value. The function assumes that the input text will contain at least one word.
