Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads an integer `n` representing the length of the text, followed by a text of single-space separated words `s1, s2, ..., si`. It then calculates the maximum count of uppercase letters in any string within the input text and prints this count, which is the volume of the text. The program follows the problem description as it calculates the volume of the given text based on the number of capital letters in each word.
