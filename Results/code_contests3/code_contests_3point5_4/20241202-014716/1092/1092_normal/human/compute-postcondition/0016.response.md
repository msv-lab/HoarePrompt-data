The value of `m` is assigned as the maximum between `s` and `m`. The value of `n` is not affected, `l` remains unchanged, `i` remains the last word in the list, and `s` still represents the total count of uppercase characters in all words of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in all words of the list.
