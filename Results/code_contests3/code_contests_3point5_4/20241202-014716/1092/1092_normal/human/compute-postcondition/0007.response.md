Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables remain the same. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1. The first word `j` in list `l` is in uppercase.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1. The first word `j` in list `l` is in uppercase**
