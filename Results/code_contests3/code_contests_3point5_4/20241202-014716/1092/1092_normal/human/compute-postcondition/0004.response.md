Example Answer: 
After executing the code, variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `m`, `i`) remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list; `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list; `s` is 0**
