According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. Since `l` contains separated words, the loop will execute if there is at least one word in the list. At the start, `m` is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the list `l` must contain at least one word, and the loop variable `i` will be the first word in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list**.
