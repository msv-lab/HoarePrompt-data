According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the first word `i`. If there are more characters left to iterate over, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged. The next character `j` in the first word `i` needs to be considered. If there are more characters in `i` after the current character `j`, the loop will execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next character `j` in the first word `i` must exist**
