Example Answer:
m is assigned the value 0. Since the value of m is directly assigned as 0, the previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, l is a list containing the separated words, m is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, l is a list containing the separated words, m is 0**
