Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `j` in the first word `i` must exist. If the character `j` is uppercase, then `s` is updated to 2.***
