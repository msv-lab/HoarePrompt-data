Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is 2, `j` iterates over the characters of the second last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character, `j` still has characters to iterate over in `i`.***
