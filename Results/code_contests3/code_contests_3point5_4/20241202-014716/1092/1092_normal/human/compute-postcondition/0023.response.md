According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` still has characters to iterate over in `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is 1, `j` iterates over the characters of the second last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still have characters to iterate over in `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute `j` iterates over the characters of the second last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character, `j` still has characters to iterate over in `i`**
