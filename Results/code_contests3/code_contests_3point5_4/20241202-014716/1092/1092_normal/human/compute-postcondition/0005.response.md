According to the code, the loop will execute if the variable `i` is iterable. In this case, `i` is the first word in the list `l`. Also, `s` is not directly involved in the loop execution but is mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0**
