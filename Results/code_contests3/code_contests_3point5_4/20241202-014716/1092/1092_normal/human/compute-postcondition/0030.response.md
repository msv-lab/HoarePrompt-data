Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The value of `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the second last word in the list. The second last word in the list is denoted by `i`. The loop variable `j` iterates over the characters of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character if the loop executes. If there are no uppercase characters in `i`, the loop does not execute. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the second last word in the list, `j` iterates over the characters of the second last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character if the loop executes, the loop does not execute if there are no uppercase characters in the second last word.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the second last word in the list, `j` iterates over the characters of the second last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character if the loop executes, the loop does not execute if there are no uppercase characters in the second last word.**
