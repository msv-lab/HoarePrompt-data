The `raw_input()` function is called, which typically reads a line from input. However, in Python 3, `raw_input()` has been removed, so this code will result in an error. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The text consists of n words separated by single spaces, each word containing only small and capital Latin letters.
