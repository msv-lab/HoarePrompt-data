Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The value of `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the last word in the list, and `m` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least three words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the last word in the list, `j` iterates over the characters of the last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character if the loop executes, the loop executes at least once for an uppercase character to be present in the last word.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least three words, `m` is updated as the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the last word in the list, `j` iterates over the characters of the last word in the list, `j` is an uppercase character if the loop executes, the loop executes at least once for an uppercase character to be present in the last word.**
