Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time the next character `j` in the first word `i` must exist.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time the next character `j` in the first word `i` must exist**
