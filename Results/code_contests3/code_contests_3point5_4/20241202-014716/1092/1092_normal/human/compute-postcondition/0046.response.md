Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, l is a list containing words, m is the maximum count of uppercase characters in any word in the list, i is the last word in the list, s is the total count of uppercase characters in all words of the list, j is an uppercase character if the loop executes, and the value of `m` is printed.
