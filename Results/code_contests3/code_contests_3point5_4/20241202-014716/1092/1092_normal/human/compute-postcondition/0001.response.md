Example Answer:
The input is split into separate words and stored in a list `l`. The value of `n` is restricted to be between 1 and 200, and the words are composed of small and capital Latin letters. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, l is a list containing the separated words.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, l is a list containing the separated words**
