Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described, splits the text into words, and iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase letters in it. It then keeps track of the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word. This aligns with the problem description of calculating the volume of the text as the maximum volume of all words in the text.
- The code correctly handles the input constraints and processes the text to calculate the volume based on the number of capital letters in each word. 
- The output of the code matches the expected output for the given examples and follows the problem description accurately.
