According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is an iterable object such as a list or tuple. Before the loop starts, the conditions required for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be an iterable object
- `i` must not be empty

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is an iterable object, `i` is not empty, `s` is 0**
