According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more characters in the word `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 2. For the loop to execute the next time, `i` must be the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the next character in the word `i`. If the character `j` is uppercase, then `s` is set to 2 for the loop to execute the next time `i` is the first word in the list `l`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the character `j` in the current word `i` must be uppercase.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 2, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `j` is the next character in the word `i` and it is uppercase**
