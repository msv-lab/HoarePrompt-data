According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in the current word `i` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1. For the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `j` is the first character in the word `i`, and the first character of the first word in the list `l` is an uppercase letter. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `j` in the current word `i` should be considered. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `j` is the next character in the word `i`.**
