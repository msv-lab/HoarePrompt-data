The variable `s` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, `s` is 0.
