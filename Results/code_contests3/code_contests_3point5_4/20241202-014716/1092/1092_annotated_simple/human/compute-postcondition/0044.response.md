Example Answer:
The value of `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the current value of `m`. The variables `n`, `text`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text with at least 2 words, `text` consists of `n` words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is an iterable object, `i` is not empty, `s` is the number of uppercase words in `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text with at least 2 words, `text` consists of `n` words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is an iterable object, `i` is not empty, `s` is the number of uppercase words in `i`**
