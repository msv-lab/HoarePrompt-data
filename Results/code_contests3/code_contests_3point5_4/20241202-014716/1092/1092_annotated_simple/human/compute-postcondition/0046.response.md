Example Answer: 
The code snippet simply prints the value of `m`, which is the maximum number of uppercase characters in any word in the list `l`. Since the code does not modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of `n` words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text, `m` is the maximum number of uppercase characters in any word in the list `l`**
