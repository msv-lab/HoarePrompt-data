Example Answer:
The input text is split into individual words and stored in list `l`. The length of the list `l` will be the same as the number of words in the input text. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, and the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, containing only small and capital Latin letters; l is a list containing the individual words from the input text.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, and the text consists of n words separated by single spaces, containing only small and capital Latin letters; l is a list containing the individual words from the input text.**
