Example Answer: 
The maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m` is assigned to `m`. Therefore, `m` is updated to the new maximum value. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l`**
