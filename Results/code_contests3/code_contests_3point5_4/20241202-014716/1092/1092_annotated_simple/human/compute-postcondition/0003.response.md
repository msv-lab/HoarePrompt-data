According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `l` must have at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, text consists of n words separated by single spaces, l is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, m is 0, i is the first word in the list**
