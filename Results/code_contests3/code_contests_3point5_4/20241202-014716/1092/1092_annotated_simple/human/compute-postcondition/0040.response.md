According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition that the next word in `i` should be in uppercase. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, text consists of `n` words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is an iterable object, `i` is not empty, `s` is 2. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next word in `i` should also be in uppercase.
State: **n is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, text consists of `n` words separated by single spaces, l is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, m is the updated maximum value, i is an iterable object, i is not empty, s is 2**.
