Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Since `m` is initially 0 and `s` represents the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l`, the maximum value between 0 and `s` will be `s`. Therefore, `m` is updated to the value of `s`. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l`.**
