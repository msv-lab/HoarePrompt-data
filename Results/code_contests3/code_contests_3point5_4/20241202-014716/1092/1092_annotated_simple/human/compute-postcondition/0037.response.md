According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable object `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words and at least one more word, `m` is the updated maximum value, `i` is an iterable object, `i` is not empty, `s` is 1. The word `j` is in uppercase. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must still be not empty and the next word in `i` should also be uppercase.
