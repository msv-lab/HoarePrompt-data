According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of the list `l`. If `i` is within the range of the list `l`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the list `l` contains at least 2 words, and `i` is pointing to the next word in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next word `i` should be within the range of the list `l`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` where `s` is incremented by 1 if the word `j` is uppercase, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be within the range of the list `l`.**
