Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` where `s` is incremented by 1 if the word `j` is uppercase.
