According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, it implies that `i` must be a word in the list `l`. 

Before the loop starts, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m`. Also, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and it is 0 at the beginning. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the text, `text` consists of n words separated by single spaces, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input text with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l` and the initial value of `m`, `i` is the next word in the list after the current `i`, `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in all words in the list `l`, for the loop to execute `i` must be a word in the list `l`**
