Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program reads the input text, splits it into words, and then iterates over each word to count the number of capital letters in each word. It keeps track of the maximum number of capital letters found in any word and prints that as the volume of the text. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly calculates the volume of the given text.
