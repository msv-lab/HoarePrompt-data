Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code does not handle the case when `n` is an even number. The else statement should have been `print(n * n // 4 - 1, n * n // 4 + 1)` instead of `(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)`. The division operator `/` should be replaced with `//` for integer division.
2. The output hints mention that if there is no Pythagorean triple containing integer `n`, the code should print -1. However, the code does not print -1 in such cases.
