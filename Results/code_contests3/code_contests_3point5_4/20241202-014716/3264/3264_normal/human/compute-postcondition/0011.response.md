Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. For `n` greater than 2, if `n` is odd, it prints ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, it prints (n^2 / 4 - 1) and (n^2 / 4 + 1). The function does not accept any parameters and the return value is not specified.**
