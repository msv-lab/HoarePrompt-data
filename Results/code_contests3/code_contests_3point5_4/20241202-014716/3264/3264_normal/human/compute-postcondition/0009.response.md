Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, `n` is decreased by 1. If `n` is between 3 and 10^9, the output varies based on whether `n` is odd or even. For odd `n`, the output is ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2. For even `n`, no changes occur in `n`.***
