Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two expressions: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is a positive even integer, the result of the first expression will be `(n^2 / 4) - 1`, and the result of the second expression will be `(n^2 / 4) + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive even integer between 3 and 10^9.
Output State: **n is a positive even integer between 3 and 10^9**
