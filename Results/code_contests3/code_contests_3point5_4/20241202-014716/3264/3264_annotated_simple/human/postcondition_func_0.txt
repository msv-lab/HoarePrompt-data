The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and performs calculations based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, it calculates and prints two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is not an odd number, it calculates and prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not have any return value.
