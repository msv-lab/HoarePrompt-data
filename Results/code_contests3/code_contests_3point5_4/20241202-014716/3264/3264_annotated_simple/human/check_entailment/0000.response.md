Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input `n` and checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints two integers based on whether `n` is odd or even, which corresponds to the Pythagorean triple as described in the problem.

For odd `n`, it calculates (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2, which forms a Pythagorean triple.
For even `n`, it calculates (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1, which also forms a Pythagorean triple.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
