Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n ≤ 2, the function does not change the state of the variables. If n is a positive odd integer greater than 2, the program variables will be (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If n is not an odd number, the variables will be (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1).***
