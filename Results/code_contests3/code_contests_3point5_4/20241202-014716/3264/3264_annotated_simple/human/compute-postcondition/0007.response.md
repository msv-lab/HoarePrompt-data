Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates two values based on the value of `n`. It first computes `n * n / 4 - 1` and then `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is an odd integer, the result of the calculations will be specific values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the two calculated values are (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1).
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the two calculated values are (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1)**
