Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and based on the value of `n`, it either prints -1 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or it calculates and prints specific values depending on whether `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, it prints two whole numbers derived from mathematical expressions. If `n` is even and greater than 2, it prints two values calculated based on other mathematical expressions. The function does not accept any input parameters and does not return any value. **
