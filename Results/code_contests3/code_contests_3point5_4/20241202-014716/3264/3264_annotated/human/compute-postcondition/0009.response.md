Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, the program prints -1. If n is a positive odd integer greater than 2, two whole numbers are printed. If n is odd, the first printed value is (n^2 / 4) - 1, and the second printed value is (n^2 / 4) + 1.***
