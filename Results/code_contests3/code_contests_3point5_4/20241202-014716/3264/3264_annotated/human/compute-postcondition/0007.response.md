Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: n * n / 4 - 1 and n * n / 4 + 1. Since n is an odd number, n * n / 4 will result in an integer value. Therefore, the first expression evaluates to (n^2 / 4) - 1 and the second expression evaluates to (n^2 / 4) + 1. 
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer; the first expression is (n^2 / 4) - 1; the second expression is (n^2 / 4) + 1**
