Example Answer:
The expressions inside the print statement calculate two values. The first value is (n * n - 1) / 2 and the second value is (n * n + 1) / 2. For a given odd positive integer n, both expressions will result in a whole number. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive odd integer, and the two values printed are whole numbers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer, and the two values printed are whole numbers**
