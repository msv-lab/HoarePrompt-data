Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The program uses incorrect logic to calculate the Pythagorean triple. The program is supposed to output two integers, m and k, such that n, m, and k form a Pythagorean triple. However, the program does not achieve this. The program's logic for calculating the Pythagorean triple is incorrect, and hence it does not produce the correct output for all potential cases. 

For example, if we input n = 3, the expected output should be m = 4 and k = 5. However, the program's output for this case will not be correct.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
