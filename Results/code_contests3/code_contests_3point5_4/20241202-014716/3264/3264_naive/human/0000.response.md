Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It has some syntax errors and logical issues. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
if n <= 2:
    print(-1)
elif n % 2 == 1:
    print((n * n - 1) // 2, (n * n + 1) // 2)
else:
    print(n * n // 4 - 1, n * n // 4 + 1)
```

The corrected program uses `input()` instead of `raw_input()`, fixed the syntax of the `print` function, and corrected the calculations to find the Pythagorean triple.
