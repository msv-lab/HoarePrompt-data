Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find Pythagorean triples based on the input side length. It covers both the cases where the input side length is odd and even, returning the correct Pythagorean triple in each case. Additionally, it handles the case where there is no Pythagorean triple containing the input side length by printing -1. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output in each case.
