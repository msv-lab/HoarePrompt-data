The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the squares of integers from 1 to n, and the sum of the cubes of integers from 1 to m. It then multiplies the sum of squares by a and the sum of cubes by b. The final output of the function is the sum of these two results. 

Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of squares of integers from 1 to n, the sum of cubes of integers from 1 to m, multiplies the sum of squares by a and the sum of cubes by b, and returns the sum of these two results.**
