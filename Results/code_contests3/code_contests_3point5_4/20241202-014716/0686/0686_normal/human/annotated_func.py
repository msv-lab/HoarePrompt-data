#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the sum of squares of integers from 1 to n, the sum of cubes of integers from 1 to m, multiplies the sum of squares by a and the sum of cubes by b, and returns the sum of these two results. The function does not accept any parameters and does not perform any actual calculations.
