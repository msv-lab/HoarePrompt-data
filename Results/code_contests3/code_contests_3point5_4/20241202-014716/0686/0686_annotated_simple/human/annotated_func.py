#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the remainders of dividing `n` by `a` and `m` by `b`, and returns "Both" if both remainders are 0, "First" if only the remainder of dividing `n` by `a` is 0, "Second" if only the remainder of dividing `m` by `b` is 0, and "Neither" if both remainders are not 0. The function does not take any parameters and does not perform any calculations based on `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b` as described in the annotations.
