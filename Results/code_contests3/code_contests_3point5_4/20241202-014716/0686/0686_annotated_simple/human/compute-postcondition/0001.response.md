The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `a` and `m` by `b`. If the remainder of both divisions is 0, the function returns "Both"; if the remainder of dividing `n` by `a` is 0 but the remainder of dividing `m` by `b` is not 0, the function returns "First"; if the remainder of dividing `m` by `b` is 0 but the remainder of dividing `n` by `a` is not 0, the function returns "Second"; if the remainder of both divisions is not 0, the function returns "Neither". Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the remainders of dividing `n` by `a` and `m` by `b`, and determine the relationship between the remainders. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the remainders of dividing `n` by `a` and `m` by `b`, and returns "Both" if both remainders are 0, "First" if only the remainder of dividing `n` by `a` is 0, "Second" if only the remainder of dividing `m` by `b` is 0, and "Neither" if both remainders are not 0.**
