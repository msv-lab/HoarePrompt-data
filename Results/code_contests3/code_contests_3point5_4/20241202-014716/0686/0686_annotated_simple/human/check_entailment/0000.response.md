Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it defines a function without any logic inside it. The function needs to be completed with the necessary logic to calculate the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations as per the problem description. Once the function is implemented correctly, it will be able to handle all the cases and provide the correct output.
