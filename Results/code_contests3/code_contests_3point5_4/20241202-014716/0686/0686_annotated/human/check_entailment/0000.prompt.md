You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Berland Football Cup starts really soon! Commentators from all over the world come to the event.

Organizers have already built n commentary boxes. m regional delegations will come to the Cup. Every delegation should get the same number of the commentary boxes. If any box is left unoccupied then the delegations will be upset. So each box should be occupied by exactly one delegation.

If n is not divisible by m, it is impossible to distribute the boxes to the delegations at the moment.

Organizers can build a new commentary box paying a burles and demolish a commentary box paying b burles. They can both build and demolish boxes arbitrary number of times (each time paying a corresponding fee). It is allowed to demolish all the existing boxes.

What is the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by m)?

Input

The only line contains four integer numbers n, m, a and b (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^{12}, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), where n is the initial number of the commentary boxes, m is the number of delegations to come, a is the fee to build a box and b is the fee to demolish a box.

Output

Output the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations (i.e. to make the number of the boxes be divisible by m). It is allowed that the final number of the boxes is equal to 0.

Examples

Input

9 7 3 8


Output

15


Input

2 7 3 7


Output

14


Input

30 6 17 19


Output

0

Note

In the first example organizers can build 5 boxes to make the total of 14 paying 3 burles for the each of them.

In the second example organizers can demolish 2 boxes to make the total of 0 paying 7 burles for the each of them.

In the third example organizers are already able to distribute all the boxes equally among the delegations, each one get 5 boxes.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12, and a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the result of (a + b)^n % m where a, b, n, and m are positive integers. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on the variables defined before the function call. However, the function lacks any implementation and does not perform the intended calculation as described in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
