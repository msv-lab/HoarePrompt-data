The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of two positive integers `a` and `b`, and then calculates the result of raising the sum to the power of `n`, and finally takes the modulus of the result with respect to the positive integer `m`. The function returns the final result after performing these calculations.
Functionality: **The function calculates the result of (a + b)^n % m where a, b, n, and m satisfy the given constraints.**
