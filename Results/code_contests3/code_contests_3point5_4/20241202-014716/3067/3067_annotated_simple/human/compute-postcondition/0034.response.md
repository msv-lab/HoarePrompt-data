According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable Q. If Q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, Q is Q - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, Q must be greater than 0.
State: **S is a string of unknown length, Q is Q - 2, P is a list representing the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to each index in S, l and r are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the difference between the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index r and up to index l is printed**
