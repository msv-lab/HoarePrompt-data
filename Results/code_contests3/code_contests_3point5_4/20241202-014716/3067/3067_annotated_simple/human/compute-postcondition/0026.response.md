Postcondition: ***S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer, P is a list with the first element being 1, the second element being 1, and the rest of the elements being 0, N is increased by 2, i is 0, and the substring of S from index i to i + 2 is 'AC'. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', then P[0] is assigned 1. Otherwise, P[0] is assigned 0 and P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
