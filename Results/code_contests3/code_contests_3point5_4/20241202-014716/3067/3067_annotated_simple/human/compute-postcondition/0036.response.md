Example Answer:
The value printed is the difference between the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index r and up to index l. This is calculated by subtracting P[l - 1] from P[r - 1]. The initial state has S as a string of unknown length, Q as Q - 2, P as a list representing the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to each index in S, and l and r as assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input. 
Output State: **S is a string of unknown length, Q is Q - 2, P is a list representing the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to each index in S, l and r are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input, and the difference between the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index r and up to index l is printed**
