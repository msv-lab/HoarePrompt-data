Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of (N + 1) zeros. The value of N is not specified in the initial state, so the length of the list P is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer, P is a list of unknown length with all elements being 0.
Output State: **S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer, P is a list of unknown length with all elements being 0**
