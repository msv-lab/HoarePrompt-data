Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string. The length of the string `S` is unknown, and `Q` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer.
Output State: **S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer**
