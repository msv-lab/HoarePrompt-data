Postcondition: ***S is a string of unknown length, Q is a positive integer, P is a list with the first element being 0 and the rest of the elements being 0. The loop will execute for the first time when i is equal to 0. If the substring of S from index i - 1 to i + 1 is 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. If the substring is not 'AC', then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
