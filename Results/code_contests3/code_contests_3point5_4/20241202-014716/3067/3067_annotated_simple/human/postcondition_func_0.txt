The function `func` reads input values N, Q, and a string S. It then calculates a list P where each element represents the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to that index in the string S. Afterward, it iterates Q times, taking pairs of integers l and r as input and prints the difference between P[r-1] and P[l-1]. The function does not explicitly return any value.
