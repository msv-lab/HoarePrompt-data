Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' up to each index in the string `S` using the list `P`. Then, for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring specified by `l` and `r` by taking the difference of the values at the indices `r - 1` and `l - 1` in the list `P`. This approach ensures that the program accurately counts the occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substrings.
