Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly initializes the list P with zeros of length N+1.
2. It then iterates through the string S and counts the number of occurrences of 'AC' in each substring ending at index i and stores it in the list P.
3. Finally, for each query, it calculates the difference between P[r-1] and P[l-1] to get the count of 'AC' occurrences in the specified substring, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.
4. The program satisfies all the constraints and requirements mentioned in the problem description.
5. The logic of the program seems correct and covers all possible cases, making it a correct solution for the given problem.
