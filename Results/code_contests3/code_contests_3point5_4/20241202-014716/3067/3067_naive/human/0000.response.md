Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input, processes the string S to count the occurrences of 'AC' at each index, and then answers the queries by calculating the difference between the count at the ending index and the starting index of the substring. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring correctness for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
