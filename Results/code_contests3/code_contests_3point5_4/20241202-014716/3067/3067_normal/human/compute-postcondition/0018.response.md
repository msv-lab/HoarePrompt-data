Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. Since i is initially 1, P[i] will take the value of P[0] which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1, and P[i] is 0.
Output State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1, and P[i] is 0**
