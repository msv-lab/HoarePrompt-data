Example Answer:
The value of the difference between the occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings ending at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` is calculated by subtracting the value at index `l - 1` from the value at index `r - 1` in list `P`. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, and the difference between the occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings ending at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` is printed.
Output State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, and the difference between the occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings ending at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` is printed**
