Example Answer:
The value of `P` is a list, and the code calculates the difference between the value at index `r - 1` and the value at index `l - 1` in the list `P`. The values of `N` and `Q` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input after splitting, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed.
Output State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input after splitting, difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed**
