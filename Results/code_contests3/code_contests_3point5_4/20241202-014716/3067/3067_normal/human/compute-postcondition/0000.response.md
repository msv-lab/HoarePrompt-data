Example Answer:
`N` and `Q` are assigned the values from the input after splitting the input string. The values of `N` and `Q` are now determined based on the input constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of the string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and Q is the number of queries to be performed.
Output State: **N is the length of the string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and Q is the number of queries to be performed**
