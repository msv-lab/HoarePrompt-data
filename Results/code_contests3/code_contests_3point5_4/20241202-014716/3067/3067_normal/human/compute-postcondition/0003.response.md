According to the code, the loop can execute if N is at least 1. Before the loop starts, N is the length of string S does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and i is now 0, and the list P needs to be updated to have N + 1 zeros.
State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, `P` is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0**
