According to the code, the loop will execute Q times. At the end of the last iteration, N is the length of string S, Q is greater than 0, and P is a list representing the number of occurrences of 'AC' in substrings. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop needs to iterate one more time, so the current iteration count needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, `P` is a list representing the number of occurrences of 'AC' in substrings, and the difference between the occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings ending at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` is printed**
