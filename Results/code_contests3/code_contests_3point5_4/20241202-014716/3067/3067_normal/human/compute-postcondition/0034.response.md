According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `Q`. If `Q` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `Q` must still be greater than 1.
State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1**
