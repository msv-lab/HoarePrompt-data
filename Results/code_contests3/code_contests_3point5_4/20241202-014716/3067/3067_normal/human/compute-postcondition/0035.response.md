Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The previous values of `l` and `r` are unknown, so the output state is: `N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input after splitting.
Output State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input after splitting**
