Postcondition: ***N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1, conditions for updating P[i] based on S[i - 1:i + 1] are applied. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and the program continues with the execution without any changes to the variables.***
