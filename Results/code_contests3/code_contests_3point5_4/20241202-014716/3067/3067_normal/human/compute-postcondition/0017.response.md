Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is initially 1, `P[1]` will be updated based on the previous value of `P[0]`. If `P[0]` is 0, then `P[1]` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1, P[1] is 1.
Output State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1, P[1] is 1**
