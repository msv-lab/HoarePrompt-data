According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of string `S`. If `i` is less than the length of string `S`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 1. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[1] is updated to 1. If the condition is not met, P[1] remains 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1, i is 2**
