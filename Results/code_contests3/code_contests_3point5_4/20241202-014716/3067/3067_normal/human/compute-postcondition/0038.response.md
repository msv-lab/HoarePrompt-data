The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where 2 <= N <= 10^5. It also takes in multiple queries `Q`, where 1 <= Q <= 10^5, each query consisting of two integers l_i and r_i representing a range within the string. The function does not return a value directly; instead, it performs a specific operation based on the input parameters.
