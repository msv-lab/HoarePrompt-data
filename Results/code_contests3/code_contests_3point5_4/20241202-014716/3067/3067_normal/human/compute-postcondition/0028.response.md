According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable Q. If Q is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is the length of string S does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `Q` is greater than 0. 
State: **`N` is the length of string S, `Q` is greater than 0, `P` is a list where each element represents the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring ending at that index**
