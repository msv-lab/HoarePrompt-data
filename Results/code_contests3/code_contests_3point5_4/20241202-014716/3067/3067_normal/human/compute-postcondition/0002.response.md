Example Answer:
`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`, where `N` is the length of string `S`. The value of `N` determines the length of the list `P`. The value of `Q` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1.
Output State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries, P is a list of zeros with a length of N + 1**
