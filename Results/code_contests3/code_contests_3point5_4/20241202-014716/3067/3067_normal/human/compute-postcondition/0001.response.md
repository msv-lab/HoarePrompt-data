Example Answer:
`S` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` reads a line from the input and `S` stores that line. The length of the string `S` is the value of `N`. The number of queries to be performed is stored in `Q`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries.
Output State: **N is the length of string S, Q is the number of queries**
