The function `func` reads an input string `S` of length `N` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It then processes multiple queries `Q`, where each query consists of two integers l and r. The function calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the substrings ending at index r - 1 and l - 1, and prints the difference of these occurrences for each query.
