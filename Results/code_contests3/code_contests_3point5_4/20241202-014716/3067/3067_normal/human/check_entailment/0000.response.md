Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input string `S` of length `N` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and processes multiple queries `Q`. For each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the substrings ending at index `r - 1` and `l - 1`, and prints the difference of these occurrences for each query. The code iterates through the string and maintains a prefix sum array `P` to keep track of the occurrences of 'AC' up to each index. Then, for each query, it simply calculates the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` to get the count of 'AC' substrings in the specified range. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the logic is consistent with the requirements.
