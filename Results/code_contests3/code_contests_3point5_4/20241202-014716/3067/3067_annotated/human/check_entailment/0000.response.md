Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for N, Q, and S. It calculates the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S up to each index and stores these counts in the list P. Then, for each query, it calculates and prints the difference between the count of 'AC' occurrences at index r - 1 and l - 1 in the list P.

The program handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for all cases. It follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected results.
