Example Answer:
Since the code assigns the value of P[i - 1] to P[i], the value of P at index i remains the same as the value at index i - 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, i is 2, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop, P[i] is the same as P[i-1].
Output State: **N is greater than 0, i is 2, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop, P[i] is the same as P[i-1]**
