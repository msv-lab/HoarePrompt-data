According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `N` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `Q`, `S`, and `P` do not directly affect the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` and `S` are assigned values based on user input, `P` is a list of zeros with length `N + 1`**
