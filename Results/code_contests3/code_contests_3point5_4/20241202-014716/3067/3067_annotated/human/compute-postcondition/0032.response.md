Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned values based on the user input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values of `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input, so the final Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 2, and now `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input.**
