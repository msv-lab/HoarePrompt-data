Example Answer:
`N` and `Q` are assigned values based on the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `N` and `Q` depend on the input provided, so the specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input**
