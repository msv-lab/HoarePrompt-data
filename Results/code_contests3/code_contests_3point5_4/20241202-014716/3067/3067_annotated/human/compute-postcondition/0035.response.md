Example Answer:
The variables `l` and `r` are assigned values based on the user input by mapping the input to integers. The values of `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input. Other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input.
