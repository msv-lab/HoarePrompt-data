`S` is assigned the value of the raw input. The values of `N` and `Q` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value**
