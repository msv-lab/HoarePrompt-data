Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, i is 2, Q and S are assigned values based on user input. P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', the program continues with the existing conditions. If not, P[i] is the same as P[i-1] and the program proceeds with the updated values.***
