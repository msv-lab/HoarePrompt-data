Postcondition: ***N is greater than 0, i is 1, Q and S are assigned values based on user input. P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned 0. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] is updated to be P[i-1] + 1. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of N, i, Q, S, and P.***
