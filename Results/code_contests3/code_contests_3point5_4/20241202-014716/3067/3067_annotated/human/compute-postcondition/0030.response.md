Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute the first time `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values based on the user input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The code then prints the difference between the values at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` of list `P`.**
