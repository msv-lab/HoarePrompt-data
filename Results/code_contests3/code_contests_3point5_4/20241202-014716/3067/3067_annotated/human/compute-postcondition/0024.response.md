Example Answer:
P[i] is assigned the value P[i - 1] + 1. The value of i is 2, so P[2] is calculated based on P[1]. The initial state does not provide the values of P[0] or P[1], so we cannot calculate the exact value of P[2]. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, i is 2, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, i is 2, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
