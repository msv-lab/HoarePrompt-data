Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `Q` and `S` are assigned values based on user input, `P` is a list with the first element as 0 and remaining elements as zeros. If the substring of `S` from index `i-1` to `i+1` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value `P[i - 1] + 1`. If the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to index `i + 1` is not equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.***
