Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are updated based on the user input. The code prints the difference between the element at index `r - 1` and the element at index `l - 1` in the list `P`.**
