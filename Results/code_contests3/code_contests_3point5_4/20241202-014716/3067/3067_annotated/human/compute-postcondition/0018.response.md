Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. The value of P[i - 1] depends on the previous iterations of the program and is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: N is greater than 0, i is 1, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned 0 and the program continues with the updated values of N, i, Q, S, and P.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, i is 1, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned 0 and the program continues with the updated values of N, i, Q, S, and P.**
