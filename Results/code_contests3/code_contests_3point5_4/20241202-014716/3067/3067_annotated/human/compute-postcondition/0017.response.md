Example Answer:
The value of P at index i is updated to be the value of P at index i-1 plus 1. The previous values of N, i, Q, S, and P are known, so the updated value of P at index i can be calculated based on that. 
Output State: **N is greater than 0, i is 1, Q and S are assigned values based on user input, P is adjusted based on the substring of S from index i-1 to i+1. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned 0, and P[i] is updated to be P[i-1] + 1.**
