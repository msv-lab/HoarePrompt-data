According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Q` and `_`. If `_` is less than `Q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Q` and `N` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, `Q` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l` and `r` are assigned values based on the user input. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers, for the loop to execute again `Q` is greater than 0 and `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are assigned values based on the user input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`**
