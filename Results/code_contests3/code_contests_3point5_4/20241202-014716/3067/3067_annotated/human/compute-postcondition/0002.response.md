Example Answer: 
`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`. The values of `N` and `Q` are determined by user input, and `S` is assigned the raw input value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of zeros with length `N + 1`.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of zeros with length `N + 1`**
