Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `N` and `Q` are assigned values based on user input, `S` is assigned the raw input value, `P` is a list of integers representing the count of occurrences where the substring of `S` from index `i-1` to `i+1` is equal to 'AC' up to index `i`. The loop will print the difference between the values at index `r - 1` and `l - 1` of list `P` for each iteration of the loop.**
