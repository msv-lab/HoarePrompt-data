Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the arrival time for each trolleybus based on the given constraints and physics principles. It considers the acceleration, deceleration, and maximum speed of each trolleybus to determine the minimum time to reach the final station. The logic provided in the program seems to cover all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
