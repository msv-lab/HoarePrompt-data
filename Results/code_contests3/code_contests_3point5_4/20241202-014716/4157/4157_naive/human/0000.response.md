Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given inputs of departure time, maximum speed, acceleration, and distance to the final station. The logic in the program accounts for the acceleration, deceleration, and catching up scenarios between trolleybuses. The program iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time taken, and outputs the arrival time for each trolleybus in the correct order. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
