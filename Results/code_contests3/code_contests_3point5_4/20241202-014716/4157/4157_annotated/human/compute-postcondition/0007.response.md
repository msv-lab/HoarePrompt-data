According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has been updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`.
State: **`t` has been updated, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`**
