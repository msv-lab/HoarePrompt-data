According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `d` are assigned integers from user input, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `d` are assigned integers from user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
