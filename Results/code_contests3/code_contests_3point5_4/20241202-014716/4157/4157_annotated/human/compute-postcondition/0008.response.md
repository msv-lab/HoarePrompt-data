Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the float values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has been updated, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input.
Output State: **`t` has been updated, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from the input**
