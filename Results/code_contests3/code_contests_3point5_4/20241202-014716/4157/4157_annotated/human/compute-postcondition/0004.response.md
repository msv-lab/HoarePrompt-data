Example Answer:
The value of `t1` is calculated based on the condition `d > v * v / (2 * a)`. If the condition is true, `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `d`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `d` are assigned integers from user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` is the first float value from user input, `v` is the second float value from user input, `t1` is calculated based on the condition.**
