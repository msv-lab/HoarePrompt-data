Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates `n` times to calculate `t1` based on the input values. It updates `t` to the maximum value of all calculated `t1 + ti` values during each iteration. The function prints the updated `t` value after each iteration.**
