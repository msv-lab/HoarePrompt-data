Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The value of `t1` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
