Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values using the `map` function with `float` as the mapping function, and `raw_input().split()` as the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `t1` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` has been further updated, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values, `t1` is calculated.
Output State: **`t` has been further updated, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than the updated value of `i`, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values, `t1` is calculated**
