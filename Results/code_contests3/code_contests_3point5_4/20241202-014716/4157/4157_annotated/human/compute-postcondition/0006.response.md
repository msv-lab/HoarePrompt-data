Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The previous values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti` are unknown, so the output state is: `t` has been updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` has been updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`**
