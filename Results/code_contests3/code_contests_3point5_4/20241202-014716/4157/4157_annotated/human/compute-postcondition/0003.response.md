Example Answer:
`ti` is assigned the first float value from the user input after splitting, and `v` is assigned the second float value from the user input after splitting. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `d`, and `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0.0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `d` are assigned integers from user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` is the first float value from user input, `v` is the second float value from user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `d` are assigned integers from user input, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` is the first float value from user input, `v` is the second float value from user input**
