Example Answer:
The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned by mapping the integers obtained from splitting the user input. Since the initial state only specifies the value of `t`, the output state will be: `t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integers from user input.
Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integers from user input**
