Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. Since `t1` and `ti` are float values, the sum of `t1` and `ti` is also a float value. The new value of `t` will be the maximum between this sum and the current value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the previous value of `t`.
Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the previous value of `t`**
