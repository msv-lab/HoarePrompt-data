Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station. It then iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station, and updates the maximum time among all trolleybuses. Finally, it prints the calculated time for each trolleybus.

The program ensures that trolleybuses do not overtake each other and calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station as described in the problem description. The logic for calculating `t1` and updating `t` is correct and follows the requirements of the problem.
