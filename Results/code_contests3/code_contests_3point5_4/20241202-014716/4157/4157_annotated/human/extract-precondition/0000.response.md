**Precondition:**
- n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses.
- a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses.
- d is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station.
- ti and vi are non-negative integers representing the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, respectively.
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a, d ≤ 10^6, 0 ≤ ti < t(i+1), 1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6.
