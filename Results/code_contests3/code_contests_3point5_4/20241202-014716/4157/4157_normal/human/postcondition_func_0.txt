The function `func` reads inputs for the number of trolleybuses and their corresponding time and speed values. For each trolleybus, it calculates the time it takes to reach a certain distance based on acceleration and then updates the maximum time taken among all trolleybuses. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
