Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression provided. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated using the first expression. Otherwise, `t1` is calculated using the `math.sqrt` function. The value of `t1` is determined by the input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input, `t1` is determined based on the condition, and the current value of `t` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input, `t1` is determined based on the condition, and the current value of `t` is printed**
