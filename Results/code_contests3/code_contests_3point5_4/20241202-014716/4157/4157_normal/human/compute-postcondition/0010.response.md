Example Answer: 
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The previous values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input, `t1` is determined based on the condition, and the current value of `t` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input, `t1` is determined based on the condition, and the current value of `t` is printed**
