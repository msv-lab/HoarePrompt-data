Example Answer: 
The value of `t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated using the first expression, otherwise, it is calculated using the `math.sqrt` function. The values of `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from user input, `t1` is either calculated using the first expression or the `math.sqrt` function based on the condition.
