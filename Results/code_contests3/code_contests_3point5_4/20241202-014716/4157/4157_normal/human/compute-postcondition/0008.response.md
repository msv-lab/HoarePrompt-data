Example Answer:
The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned by splitting the user input and converting them to float. The initial state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input, `t1` is either calculated using the first expression or the `math.sqrt` function based on the condition, and the current value of `t` is printed.
