According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is 0.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute. So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `d` have user-assigned integer values, `t` is 0.0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
