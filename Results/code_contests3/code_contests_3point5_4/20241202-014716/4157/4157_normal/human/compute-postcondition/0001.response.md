Example Answer:
The `map(int, raw_input().split())` function takes input separated by spaces, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `n`, `a`, and `d` respectively. Since the initial state is not provided for `n`, `a`, and `d`, the output state after execution will be:
Output State: **`n`, `a`, `d` are assigned integer values from user input; `t` is 0.0**
