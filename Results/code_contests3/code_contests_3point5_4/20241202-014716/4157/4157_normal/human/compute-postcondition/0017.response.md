Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `d` have integer values from user input, `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t` for all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `ti` and `v` have float values from user input for the last iteration, `t1` is determined based on certain conditions for the last iteration, and the final value of `t` is printed**
