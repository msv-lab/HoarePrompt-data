Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The program reads the input for the number of trolleybuses and their corresponding time and speed values. For each trolleybus, it calculates the time it takes to reach a certain distance based on acceleration and updates the maximum time taken among all trolleybuses. The code handles the scenario where a trolleybus catches up with another one and they travel together to the final station. The logic of calculating the time taken for each trolleybus seems to align with the problem requirements. Additionally, the code outputs the arrival time for each trolleybus in the order they are given in the input, as specified in the problem description. Based on the provided code and the problem description, it seems like the code covers all potential cases.
