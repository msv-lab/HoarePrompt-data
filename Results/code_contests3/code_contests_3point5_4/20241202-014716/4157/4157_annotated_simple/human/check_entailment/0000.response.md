Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the provided formula in the problem description. It iterates through each trolleybus, calculates the time using the formula, and updates the maximum time `t` accordingly. The output for each trolleybus is then printed in the correct order.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the expected output for each trolleybus.
