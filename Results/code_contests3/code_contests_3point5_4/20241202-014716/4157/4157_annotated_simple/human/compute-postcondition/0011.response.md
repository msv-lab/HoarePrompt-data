Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `t`. The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `t`, `ti`, or `t1`, so the final output state will depend on the values of the input at runtime.
Output State: **The value of `t` after the calculation**
