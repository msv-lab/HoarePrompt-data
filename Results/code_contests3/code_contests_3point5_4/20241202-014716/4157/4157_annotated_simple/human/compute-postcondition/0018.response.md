The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on predefined parameters n, a, d and the list of trolleybuses with ti and vi values. The constraints for n, a, d are mentioned above. Each trolleybus has ti and vi integers with specific constraints as well. The function performs some operations on these parameters and trolleybus values but the exact details are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on predefined parameters and trolleybus values without accepting any additional parameters and return the result of these operations.
