Example Answer:
`t1` is calculated based on the formula provided. The value of `t1` depends on the values of `v`, `a`, and `d`. If the condition `d > v * v / (2 * a)` is true, `t1` will be calculated as `(v / a) + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If the condition is false, `t1` will be calculated as the square root of `(2 * d) / a`. Therefore, the output state is: `ti` holds a float value, `v` holds a float value, `t1` is calculated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`ti` holds a float value, `v` holds a float value, `t1` is calculated based on the provided formula**
