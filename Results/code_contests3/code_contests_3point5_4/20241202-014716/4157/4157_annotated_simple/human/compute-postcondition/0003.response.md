Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, raw_input().split())`. Since the input is not specified, the output state will be: `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integers within the specified ranges, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integers within the specified ranges, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
