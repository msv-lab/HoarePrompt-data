According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `a` and `d` are mentioned but not used in the loop, they do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integers within the specified ranges**
