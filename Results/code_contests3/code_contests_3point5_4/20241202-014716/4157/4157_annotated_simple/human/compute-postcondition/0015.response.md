Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`. The variables `ti` and `v` are not directly affected by this operation. The value of `t1` is calculated based on the provided formula, but the exact value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `ti` holds a float value, `v` holds a float value, `t1` is calculated based on the provided formula, and `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`.
Output State: **`ti` holds a float value, `v` holds a float value, `t1` is calculated based on the provided formula, `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`**
