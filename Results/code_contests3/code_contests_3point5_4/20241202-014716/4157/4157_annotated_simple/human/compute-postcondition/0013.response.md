Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values of `map(float, raw_input().split())`. Since `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, and `map(float, ...)` converts the input values to float, `ti` and `v` will hold the float values entered. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 
Output State: **`ti` holds a float value, `v` holds a float value**
