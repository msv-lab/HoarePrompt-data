The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It reads input for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates over `n` trolleybuses to calculate the maximum time `t` based on the provided formulas. The calculated maximum time `t` is printed after each iteration. The function operates on predefined parameters and trolleybus values and returns the maximum time `t` calculated during the iteration process.
