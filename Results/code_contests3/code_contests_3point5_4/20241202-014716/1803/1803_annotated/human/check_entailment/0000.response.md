Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It extracts the second letter of the input string followed by every third letter, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The program should be counting the total number of distinct letters in the set, not extracting specific letters based on a pattern. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
