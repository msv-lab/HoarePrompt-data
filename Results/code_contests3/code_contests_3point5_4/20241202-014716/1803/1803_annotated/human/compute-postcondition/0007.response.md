Example Answer:
The value of `Arreglo` is updated by adding the element at index `k` of `Cadena` to it. Since `Cadena` contains at least 3 small English letters and `k` is 5, the element at index 5 of `Cadena` does not exist. Therefore, the output state is: `Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`**
