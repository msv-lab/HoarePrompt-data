Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo` concatenated with the element at index `k` of `Cadena`, which is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets. Since `k` is 1, we will extract the second letter from `Cadena`. Therefore, after execution, `Arreglo` will contain a list with the second letter of `Cadena`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets; `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`; `k` is 1**
