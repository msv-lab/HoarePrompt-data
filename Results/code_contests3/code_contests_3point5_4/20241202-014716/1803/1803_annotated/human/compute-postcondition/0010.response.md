Example Answer:
The value at index `k` in `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo`. Since `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, the new value of `Arreglo` will be the letter at index `k` in `Cadena`. The `k` is incremented by 6 for the loop to execute again. The length of `Cadena` must be greater than the new value of `k` and greater than 2. 
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena` followed by the letter at index `k`, `k` is incremented by 6 for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` must be greater than the new value of `k` and greater than 2**
