`k` is incremented by 3, but the initial value of `k` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is incremented by 3**
