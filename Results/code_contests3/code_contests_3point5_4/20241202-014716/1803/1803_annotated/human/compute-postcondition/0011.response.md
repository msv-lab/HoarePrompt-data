Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3, so the new value of `k` depends on the previous value of `k`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena` followed by the letter at index `k`, `k` is incremented by 6 for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` must be greater than the new value of `k` and greater than 2, `k` is incremented by 3.
