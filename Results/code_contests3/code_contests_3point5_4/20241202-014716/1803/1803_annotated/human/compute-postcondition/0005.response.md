Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3, where `k` was initially 1. After execution, `k` becomes 4. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets; `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing at least 3 small English letters separated by commas and enclosed in brackets; `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`; `k` is 4**
