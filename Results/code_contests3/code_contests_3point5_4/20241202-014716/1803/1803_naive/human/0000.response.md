Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers every third character in the input string as a letter, which is not the correct approach. It should instead extract the letters between the commas and then count the distinct letters. 

For example, for the input "{b, a, b, a}", the program would output 1 instead of the correct answer of 2.
