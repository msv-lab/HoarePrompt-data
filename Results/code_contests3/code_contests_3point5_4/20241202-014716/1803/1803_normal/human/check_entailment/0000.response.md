Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The code extracts every third character starting from index 1 in the input string, but the problem description requires counting the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The code does not handle duplicate letters correctly, as it only extracts and counts every third character. This means that if a letter is repeated in the input string, it will not be counted as a distinct letter. 

For example, for the input "{b, a, b, a}", the code would output 1 instead of the correct answer which is 2. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
