According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `Cadena` and the value of `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, and `k` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 4 and also greater than 2. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4, for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` is greater than 4 and also greater than 2**.
