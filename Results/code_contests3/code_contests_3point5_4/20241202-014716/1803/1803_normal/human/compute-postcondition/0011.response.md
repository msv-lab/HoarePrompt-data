Example Answer:
`k` is updated to be 10 since `k` was 7 and it gets incremented by 3. The conditions for the loop to execute again are still met as the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4 and also greater than 2. `Arreglo` is then updated to include the element at index 7 of `Cadena`, which is the element at index 7. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains the element at index 7 of `Cadena`, `k` is 10, for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` is greater than 4 and also greater than 2.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the element at index 7 of `Cadena`, `k` is 10, for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` is greater than 4 and also greater than 2**
