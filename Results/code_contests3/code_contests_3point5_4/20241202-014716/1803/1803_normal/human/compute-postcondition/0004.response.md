Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo` concatenated with the element at index `k` of the list `Cadena`. Since `Arreglo` is initially an empty list and `k` is 1, the element at index 1 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. Therefore, after execution, `Arreglo` will contain the element at index 1 of `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
