According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `Cadena` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. Right before the loop, `Arreglo` is an empty list and `k` is 1. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute the first time:
- `Arreglo` being an empty list does not affect the loop condition.
- `k` being 1 is sufficient for the loop to start.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1**
