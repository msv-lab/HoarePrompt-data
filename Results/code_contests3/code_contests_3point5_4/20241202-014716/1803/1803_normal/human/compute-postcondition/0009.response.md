According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `Cadena` and the value of `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 7, and for the loop to execute again the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 4 and also greater than 2. Additionally, `Arreglo` is updated by adding the element at index 4 of `Cadena`. Therefore, the state of `Arreglo` needs to be adjusted to include the element at index 4 of `Cadena`.
State: **`Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 of `Cadena`, `k` is 7, for the loop to execute again length of `Cadena` is greater than 4 and also greater than 2**
