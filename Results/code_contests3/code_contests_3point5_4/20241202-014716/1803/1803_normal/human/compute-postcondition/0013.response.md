Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the unique elements in the list `Arreglo`. The set function is used to remove duplicates, then converted back to a list to calculate the length. Therefore, the output state is: `Arreglo` contains the elements at indexes 1, 4, 7, ... of `Cadena`, `k` is such that for the loop to execute again, `len(Cadena) <= k` or `len(Cadena) <= 2, and the length of unique elements in `Arreglo` is printed.
Output State: **`Arreglo` contains the elements at indexes 1, 4, 7, ... of `Cadena`, `k` is such that for the loop to execute again, `len(Cadena) <= k` or `len(Cadena) <= 2, and the length of unique elements in `Arreglo` is printed**
