Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It seems to be incorrectly indexing into the input string and adding the characters to the list. Additionally, it does not handle the case when there are no letters in the set (empty set). 

A potential input where the program does not work as expected:
Input
{b, a, b, a}

Expected Output
2

Actual Output
4

This discrepancy shows that the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
