Example Answer:
The code prints the length of the unique elements in the list `Arreglo`. The list `Arreglo` is constructed based on the elements added from `Cadena` according to the loop conditions. The length of the list of unique elements is then printed. The initial state remains unchanged with `Cadena` unchanged, `Arreglo` containing elements based on the loop conditions, and `k` such that `len(Cadena) <= k`.
Output State: **`Cadena` remains unchanged, `Arreglo` contains elements according to loop conditions, `k` such that `len(Cadena) <= k, and the length of unique elements in `Arreglo` is printed.**
