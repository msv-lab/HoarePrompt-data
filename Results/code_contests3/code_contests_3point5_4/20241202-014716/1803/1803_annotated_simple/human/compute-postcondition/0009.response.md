According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `Cadena` and `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the first element of `Cadena`, the value at index 4 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`, and the loop will execute again with the updated value of `k`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the first element of `Cadena`, the value at index 4 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`, for the loop to execute again, `k` is updated**
