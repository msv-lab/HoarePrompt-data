Example Answer:
The value at index k of Cadena is appended to the end of Arreglo. Since k is 4, the value at index 4 of Cadena is added to Arreglo. The length of Cadena is greater than 4, so the loop will execute again. The initial state is Cadena is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo contains the first element of Cadena, k is 4. After executing the code, the Output State is: Cadena is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo contains the first element of Cadena, the value at index 4 of Cadena is added to Arreglo, and the loop will execute again.
Output State: **Cadena is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; Arreglo contains the first element of Cadena, the value at index 4 of Cadena is added to Arreglo, the loop will execute again**
