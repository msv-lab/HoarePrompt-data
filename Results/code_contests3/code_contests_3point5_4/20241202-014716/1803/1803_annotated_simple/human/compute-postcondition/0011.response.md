Example Answer:
`k` is updated by adding 3 to its previous value. The value of `k` will be incremented by 3. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the elements added from `Cadena`, and `k` is updated for the next iteration.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the elements added from `Cadena`, and `k` is updated for the next iteration**
