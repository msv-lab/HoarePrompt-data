The list `Arreglo` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `Cadena` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` is an empty list.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` is an empty list**
