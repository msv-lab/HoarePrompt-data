Example Answer:
The value at index `k` in `Cadena` is added to the list `Arreglo`. The initial state has an empty list `Arreglo`, so after the execution, the first element of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. The loop is set to execute for the first time when `k` is 1, so the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the first element of `Cadena`, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the first element of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
