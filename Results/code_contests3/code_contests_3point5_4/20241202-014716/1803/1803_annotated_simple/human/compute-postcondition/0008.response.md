Example Answer:
`k` is incremented by 3. The initial value of `k` is unknown, so the new value of `k` will be `k + 3`. The loop will execute again with the updated value of `k`.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the first element of `Cadena`, the value at index 4 of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`, the loop will execute again with the updated value of `k`**
