Example Answer:
`Arreglo` is updated by adding the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. The value of `k` is updated after each iteration to access the next element in `Cadena`. The previous values of the variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the elements added from `Cadena`, and `k` is updated for the next iteration.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` contains the elements added from `Cadena`, and `k` is updated for the next iteration**
