Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value 1. The value of `k` is now 1 but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string containing small English letters enclosed within brackets, separated by commas and spaces; `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1**
