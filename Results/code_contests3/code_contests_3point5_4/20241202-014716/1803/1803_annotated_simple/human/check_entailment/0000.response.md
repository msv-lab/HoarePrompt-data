Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The program only considers every third character in the input line, which is not a valid approach for counting distinct letters within the set. This would lead to incorrect results in cases where the input contains repeated letters or in cases where the letters are not in the expected order.

For example, in the input "{b, a, b, a}" the program would output 1 instead of the correct answer of 2. This is because the program only considers every third character and does not handle the repeated letters correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
