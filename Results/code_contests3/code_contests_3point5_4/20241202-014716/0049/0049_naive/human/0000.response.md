Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if there exists a character in the string that is greater than the character next to it. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the substring to reverse. If no such character is found, it prints "NO". The logic follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the program handles multiple answers by printing any suitable substring that can be reversed to obtain a lexicographically less string.
