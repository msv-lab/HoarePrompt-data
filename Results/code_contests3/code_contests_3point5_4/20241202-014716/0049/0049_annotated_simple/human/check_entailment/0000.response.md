Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the string `s` and checks if there exists a pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the indices of the pair. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO" as required. The program always outputs the correct result based on the problem description.
