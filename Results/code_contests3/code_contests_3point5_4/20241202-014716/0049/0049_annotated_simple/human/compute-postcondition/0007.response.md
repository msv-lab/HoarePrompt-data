Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `pos` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`flag` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1, `pos` is 0**
