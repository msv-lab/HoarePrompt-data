According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, flag is set to False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and i is now 0. 
State: **`flag` is False, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
