Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the input. It then iterates through the string to find if there exists a pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the elements forming that pair. If no such pair is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return a value. It operates on predefined variables `n` and `s`, with `n` being an integer between 2 and 3*10^5, and `s` being a string of lowercase letters.**
