According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n - 1`, so the loop will execute again. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `flag` remains True
- `i` is increased by 1
- `n` remains the same
- The element at index `i` of list `c` should be greater than the element at index `i + 1`
- `pos` should be increased by 1

State: **`flag` is True, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the same, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is increased by 1**
