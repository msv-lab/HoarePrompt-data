The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on the predefined variables `n` and `s`. The parameter constraints are that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function does not have a specific return value specified in the provided information.
