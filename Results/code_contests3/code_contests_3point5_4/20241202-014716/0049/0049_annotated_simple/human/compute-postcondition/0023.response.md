Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean. If `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of a pair where the current element is greater than the next element, `i` is an integer that increments by 1 until the loop terminates, `n` remains the same, an integer greater than or equal to 2. The values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` are printed. If `flag` is False, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of a pair where the current element is greater than the next one, `i` is an integer that increments by 1 until the loop terminates, `n` remains the same, an integer greater than or equal to 2.***
