According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, `i` is increased by 1, `n` remains the same, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is increased by 1 and assigned the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `pos` needs to be increased by 1 and assigned the value of the new `i`.
State: **`flag` is True, `i` is increased by 2, `n` remains the same, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is increased by 2 and assigned the value of the new `i`**
