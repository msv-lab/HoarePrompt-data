Example Answer:
The code snippet attempts to map integers from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. However, there is a syntax error in the code as `raw_input()` is not the correct function in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()`. Therefore, the code will throw an error.
Output State: **SyntaxError: invalid syntax**
