Example Answer:
`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` has been previously increased by 1. Since the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is True, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the same, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is increased by 1, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`.
Output State: **`flag` is True, `i` is increased by 1, `n` is the same, the element at index `i` of list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, `pos` is increased by 1, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`**
