The function `func` reads input from the user, processes the input list `c` to check if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' followed by the index positions of that pair. If no such pair exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
