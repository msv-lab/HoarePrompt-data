Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The program only checks if there is at least one pair of adjacent elements where the current element is greater than the next element, and if so, it prints the indices of that pair. However, the problem description requires finding a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. This involves more than just checking adjacent elements. Therefore, the program does not accurately solve the given problem.
