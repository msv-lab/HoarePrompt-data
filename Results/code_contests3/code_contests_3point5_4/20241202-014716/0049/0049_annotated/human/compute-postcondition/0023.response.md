Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `i`, `n`, `pos` are integers, `c` is a list of integers. If `flag` is True, it means there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in the list `c` such that the element at the current index is greater than the element at the next index. In this case, the program maintains the same state as described in the precondition. If `flag` is False, the program prints 'NO' and the state of the program changes to reflect this output, but the values of `i`, `n`, `c`, and `pos` remain the same.***
