Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The condition mentioned in the initial state implies that the element at index `i` in list `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` in `c`. Therefore, `pos` is 0.
Output State: **`flag` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, c is a list of integers, the element at index `i` in c is greater than the element at index `i + 1` in c, `pos` is 0**
