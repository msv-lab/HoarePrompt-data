Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element obtained from splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. However, `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`. Therefore, the code will result in a `NameError`. 
Output State: **NameError**
