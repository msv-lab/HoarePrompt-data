Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when it is impossible to reverse some substring of the given string to obtain a string which is lexicographically less. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aabcfg
```

The program will output "YES 3 4", which is incorrect because reversing the substring from index 3 to 4 ('cf') will result in 'abacfg', which is not lexicographically less than the original string 'aabcfg'. The correct output should be "NO" for this input.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the Correctness **False**.
