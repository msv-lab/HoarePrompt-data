Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input. The value of `c` will depend on the input given. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value.
Output State: **`n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value**
