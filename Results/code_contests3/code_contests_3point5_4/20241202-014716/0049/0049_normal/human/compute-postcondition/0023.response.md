Postcondition: ***`n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value. If there exists any pair of elements in `c` such that the element at the current index is greater than the next element, `flag` is True and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence where this condition is met. In this case, the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` are printed. If no such pair exists, `flag` remains False, and the output is 'NO'.***
