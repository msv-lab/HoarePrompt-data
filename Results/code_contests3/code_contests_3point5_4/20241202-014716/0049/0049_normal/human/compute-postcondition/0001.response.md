Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of length `n`, `n` now holds the ASCII value of the first character in the string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`**
