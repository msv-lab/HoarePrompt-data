Example Answer:
The variable `flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value, `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value, `flag` is False**
