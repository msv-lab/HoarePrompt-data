The value of `flag` is assigned as `True`, changing its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0. The `i-th` element of `c` is greater than the `i+1-th` element of `c`.
