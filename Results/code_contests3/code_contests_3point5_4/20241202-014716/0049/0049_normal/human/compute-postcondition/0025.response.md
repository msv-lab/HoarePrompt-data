Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` as input. It then iterates through the string `c` to check if there exists any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the first occurrence of this condition. If no such pair exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
