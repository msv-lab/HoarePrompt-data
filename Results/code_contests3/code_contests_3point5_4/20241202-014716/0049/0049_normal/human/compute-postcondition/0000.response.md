Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to the input values obtained by splitting the raw input. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3*10^5, and s is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
