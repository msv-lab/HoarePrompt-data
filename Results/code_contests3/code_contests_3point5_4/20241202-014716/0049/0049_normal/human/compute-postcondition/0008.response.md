Postcondition: ***`n` is an ASCII value of the first character in the string `s`, `c` is the input value, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, the program sets `flag` to True. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
