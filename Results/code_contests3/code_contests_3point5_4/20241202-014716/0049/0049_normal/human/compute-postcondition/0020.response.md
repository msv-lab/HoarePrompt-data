The code snippet `print(pos + 1, pos + 2)` simply prints the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. The values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` depend on the index `pos` where the condition of the element at the current index being greater than the next element is met.

Since `flag` is True, it implies that such a pair exists in the list `c`, and `pos` holds the index of the first occurrence where this condition is met. Therefore, `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` will represent the subsequent elements in the list `c` after this occurrence.

Output State: **The values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` where `pos` is the index of the first occurrence where the condition is met in list `c` are printed.**
