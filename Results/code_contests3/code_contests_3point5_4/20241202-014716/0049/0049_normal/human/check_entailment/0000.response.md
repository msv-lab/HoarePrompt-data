Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply checks if there exists any pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the first occurrence of this condition. However, this logic does not cover all scenarios where a substring can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
aabcfg
```
The code will output "YES" and the indices 2 and 3, indicating that the substring "ab" can be reversed. However, reversing "ab" will not result in a lexicographically less string. The correct output should be "NO" for this case.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all scenarios as described in the problem description.
