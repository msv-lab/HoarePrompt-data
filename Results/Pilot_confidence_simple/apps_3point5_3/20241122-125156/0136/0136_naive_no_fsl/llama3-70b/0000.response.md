Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads in two integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them as per the problem description. It then prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison result. 
The logic used in the program aligns with the problem requirements, and the provided examples also demonstrate the correct behavior of the program. Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases.
