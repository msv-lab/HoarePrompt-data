Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. It correctly reads the list of buy prices and sell prices for the shares.
3. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price.
4. It then checks if the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, and if so, it prints the initial amount of bourles.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial amount of bourles and then calculates the total amount of bourles after selling all the shares at the maximum sell price.
6. Finally, it prints the total amount of bourles.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases correctly.
