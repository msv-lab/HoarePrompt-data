Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the arrival time and interval between buses for each route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the provided logic in the problem description.
3. The program then correctly determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time calculated for each route.
4. The output matches the expected output based on the provided examples.
5. The logic in the code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description.
6. The program uses a greedy approach to select the bus route with the minimum wait time, which is the correct approach for this problem.
