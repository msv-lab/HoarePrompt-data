Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for n and k. It then iterates through the range 1 to k+1 and calculates the remainder of n divided by i. If the calculated remainder is already in the set, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints "Yes". This logic correctly follows the problem description and ensures that all remainders are distinct.
