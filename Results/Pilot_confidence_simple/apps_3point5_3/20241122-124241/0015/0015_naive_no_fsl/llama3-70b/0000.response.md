Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the difference between the favorite number and the first element of the sequence is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements. If the condition is satisfied, it prints "YES", indicating that the favorite number appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO". The program handles the cases where the difference between neighboring elements is 0 separately to ensure correct output.
