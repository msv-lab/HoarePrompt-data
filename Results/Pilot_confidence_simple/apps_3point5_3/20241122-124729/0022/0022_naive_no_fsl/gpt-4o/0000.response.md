Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the given string is symmetric about the middle. It then reads the input string, calls `func_1` to check if it is an "s-palindrome" and prints "TAK" or "NIE" accordingly. The logic of comparing the characters from the start and end of the string to check for symmetry is correct and covers all cases where the string is not an "s-palindrome". The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
