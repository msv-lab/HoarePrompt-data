Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly filters students based on their height and weight relative to the specified minimum values. 

Here's how the logic works:
- The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `student_data`, where each key is a student's name, and the corresponding value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight.
- The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through each student in `student_data`. For each student, it checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight`, respectively.
- If both conditions are met, that student is included in the returned dictionary with their original data.

This implementation handles varying cases, including:
1. An empty dictionary (it will simply return an empty dictionary).
2. Students whose height and weight are exactly at the minimum (they will be included).
3. Students who do not meet either the height or weight requirements (they will be excluded).

The program will return the correct output for all edge cases, such as when no students meet the criteria or when all students meet the criteria. Therefore, I see no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
