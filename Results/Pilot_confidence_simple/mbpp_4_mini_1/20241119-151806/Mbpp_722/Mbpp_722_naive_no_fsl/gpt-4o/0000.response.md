Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary of students with their respective heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight parameters. The program filters out students who do not meet the criteria of having both height and weight above the minimum values. 

I reviewed the given assertions and can confirm that they all produce the expected outputs based on the filtering logic implemented in the function. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to efficiently create a new dictionary with only those students who satisfy both conditions. 

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
