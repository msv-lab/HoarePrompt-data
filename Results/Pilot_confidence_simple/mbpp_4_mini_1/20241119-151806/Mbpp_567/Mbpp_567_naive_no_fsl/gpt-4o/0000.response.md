Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program handles various scenarios:

1. The program iterates through the list using a for loop that compares each element with the next one.
2. If it finds any element that is greater than the next one (i.e., `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

The assertions provided in the code confirm the functionality:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True`, which is correct as the list is sorted.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False`, which is correct since the last two numbers are out of order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False`, which is also correct due to the descending order between `15` and `14`.

The program appears to cover all necessary cases, including empty lists and lists with one element, both of which should return `True`, as empty lists and single-element lists are trivially sorted. Thus, no potential cases have been identified where the function does not perform as expected according to the problem description.
