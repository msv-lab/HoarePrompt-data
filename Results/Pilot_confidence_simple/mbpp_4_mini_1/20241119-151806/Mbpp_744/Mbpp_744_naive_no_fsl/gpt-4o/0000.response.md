Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if a tuple contains any `None` values. It iterates through each item in the tuple and returns `True` if it encounters a `None`. If it goes through the entire tuple without finding a `None`, it returns `False`.

The assertions included in the program cover the following cases:
1. A tuple with a `None` value: `func_1((10, 4, 5, 6, None))` returns `True`.
2. A tuple with no `None` values: `func_1((7, 8, 9, 11, 14))` returns `False`.
3. Another tuple with a `None` value: `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, None))` returns `True`.

The function works correctly for all provided test cases and handles the requirement to check for `None` values accurately. There are no edge cases that the function fails to account for, as it effectively checks all elements in the tuple. 

Thus, the program fulfills the problem description completely.
