To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly checks if all characters in a string are the same, according to the problem description.

The provided program is:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> bool:
    return len(set(s)) == 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` converts the string `s` into a set. A set in Python automatically removes duplicate entries, so if all characters in `s` are the same, the length of the set will be 1.
   - The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1, indicating that all characters are the same; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string `""` should return `True` since there are no characters, and all (zero) characters can be considered the same.
   - A string with a single character, e.g., `"a"`, should return `True`.
   - A string with different characters, e.g., `"abc"`, should return `False`.
   - A string with multiple occurrences of the same character, e.g., `"aaaa"`, should return `True`.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function correctly handles various cases, including edge cases of empty strings and single-character strings.
   - It does not fail for strings containing different characters.

### Conclusion:
Since the function behaves correctly across all potential cases outlined above and meets the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
