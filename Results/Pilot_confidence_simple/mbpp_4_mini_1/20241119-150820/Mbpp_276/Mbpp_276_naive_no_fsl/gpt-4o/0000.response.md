To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which is to compute the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.

### Analyzing the provided program:
The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi \times r^2 \times h
\]

Where:
- \( r \) is the radius.
- \( h \) is the height.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes `radius` and `height` as inputs and calculates the volume using the correct formula.

### Example test cases:
1. `func_1(10, 5)` should return approximately \( 1570.75 \) which matches the assertion.
2. `func_1(4, 5)` should return approximately \( 251.32 \) which matches the assertion.
3. `func_1(4, 10)` should return approximately \( 502.64 \) which also matches the assertion.

### Edge cases to consider:
- What happens if the radius or height is zero?
- What happens if the radius or height is negative?

### Evaluation of edge cases:
- **Zero values**: 
  - `func_1(0, 5)` should return \( 0 \) which is expected.
  - `func_1(10, 0)` should also return \( 0 \) which is expected.
  
- **Negative values**:
  - `func_1(-10, 5)` would result in a negative volume, which is physically incorrect for the volume of a cylinder. 
  - Similarly, `func_1(10, -5)` would also result in a negative volume.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle edge cases where the radius or height is zero or negative, which can lead to unexpected results (like negative volumes). Since the program does not correctly handle these potential cases as described, it is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

The program fails for cases where the radius or height is zero or negative, which does not fulfill the problem description that expects valid cylinder dimensions.
