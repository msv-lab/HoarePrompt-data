Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to add a tuple to a list. It does this by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list. 

The assertions provided in the program test the functionality with different input cases, and they all pass successfully:
- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` correctly returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` correctly returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` correctly returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

No edge cases or potential failures in the logic can be identified, as the function handles tuples of varying lengths and the addition of them to lists correctly. Therefore, the program meets the problem's requirements for all tested cases.
