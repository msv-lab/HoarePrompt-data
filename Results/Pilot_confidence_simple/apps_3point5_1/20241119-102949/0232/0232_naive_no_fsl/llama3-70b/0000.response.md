Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each color within the current window, and compares these counts with the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the "found" flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "YES" if a matching interval is found, and "NO" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
