Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes the input string and the remembered substring, then iterates through the input string to construct the smallest possible integer n by only including the characters that are present in the remembered substring. Finally, it appends the remembered substring to n and returns the integer value of n. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for the given examples.
