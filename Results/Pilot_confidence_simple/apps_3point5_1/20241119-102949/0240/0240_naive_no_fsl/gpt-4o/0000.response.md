Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes in the string received by Kate and the substring Vasya remembers as input.
2. It then generates all possible numbers using permutations of the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring.
3. It checks if the generated number is valid by ensuring the remembered substring is present in the number and the length of the number is correct.
4. Finally, it returns the smallest valid number that satisfies the conditions.

The program logic seems to correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the smallest possible initial integer n is found.
