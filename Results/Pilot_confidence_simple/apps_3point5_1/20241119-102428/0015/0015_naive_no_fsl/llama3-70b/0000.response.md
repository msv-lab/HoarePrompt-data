Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c=0), then the only way for Vasya's favorite number b to appear in the sequence is if the first element a is equal to b. This case is handled correctly in the code.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is not 0 (c!=0), then Vasya's favorite number b can appear in the sequence if the difference between b and a is a multiple of c and the result is non-negative. This case is also handled correctly in the code.
