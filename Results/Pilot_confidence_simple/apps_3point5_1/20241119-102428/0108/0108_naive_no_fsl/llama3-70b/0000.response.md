Correctness: True

Explanation: The program iterates through each character of the alphabet and replaces occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. If the resulting string contains all the characters of the alphabet in order, it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints -1. This logic correctly follows the problem description and will work for all possible input strings.
