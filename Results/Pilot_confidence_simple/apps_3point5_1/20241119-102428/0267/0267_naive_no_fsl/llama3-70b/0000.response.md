Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement by using a dynamic programming approach to calculate the count of numbers satisfying the given conditions.

The function `count` calculates the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in the range $[0, n]$. The main function `func_1` then calculates the required sum by subtracting the count of numbers satisfying the conditions up to $l-1$ from the count up to $r$ and takes the result modulo $998244353$.

The program reads the input correctly, calls the `func_1` function with the given inputs, and prints the output as expected. The implementation seems to cover all potential cases and correctly calculates the sum of numbers meeting the specified conditions.
