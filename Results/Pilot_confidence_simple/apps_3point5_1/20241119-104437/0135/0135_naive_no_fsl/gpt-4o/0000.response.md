Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct. It handles the case when k ≥ n and returns 'No' in that case. It then iterates through all possible remainders and checks if they have been seen before using a set. If a remainder is already in the set, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for every potential case.
