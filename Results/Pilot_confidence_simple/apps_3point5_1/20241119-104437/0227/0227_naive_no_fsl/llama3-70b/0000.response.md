Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables m required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence a and then iterates through it to check if each element is equal to twice the previous element. If not, it increments the number of variables m. The program then outputs m if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise -1. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
