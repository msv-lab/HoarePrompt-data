Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It sorts the input sequence, then iterates through each element to check if it can be formed using the values already assigned to the variables. If it cannot be formed, it increments the count of variables needed. The program returns the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
