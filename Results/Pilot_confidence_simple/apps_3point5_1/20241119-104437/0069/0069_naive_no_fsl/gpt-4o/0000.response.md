Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, length of string $s$, desired balance $x$, and the binary string $s$.
2. It calculates the balance of the string $s$ and then calculates the prefix balances for each prefix of $t$.
3. It correctly handles the case when the balance of $s$ is 0 and checks if the desired balance $x$ is in the prefix balances list to determine if there are infinite prefixes.
4. It correctly counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance $x$ by iterating through the prefix balances list and checking if the difference between the desired balance $x$ and the prefix balance is divisible by the balance of $s$.
5. The program outputs the correct number of prefixes for each test case or -1 if there are infinite prefixes.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic to calculate the number of prefixes with a given balance $x$ for each test case.
