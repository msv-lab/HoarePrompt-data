Correctness: False

The provided program does not always generate a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers that sum up to n with the maximum possible greatest common divisor. For example, for the input (6, 3), the program outputs "1 2 3" which is correct. However, for the input (8, 2), the program outputs "2 6" which is not a strictly increasing sequence. The correct output should be "2 6" as the greatest common divisor is 2. Thus, the program does not always follow the problem description.
