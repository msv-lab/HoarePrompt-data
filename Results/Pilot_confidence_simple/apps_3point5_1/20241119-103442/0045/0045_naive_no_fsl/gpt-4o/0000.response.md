Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes an input of two positive integers n and k. It then calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers. If the minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence. Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor d and the remainder. It then constructs the sequence by distributing the remainder among the numbers in the sequence to maximize the greatest common divisor. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise -1.

The logic in the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program constructs a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers with maximum greatest common divisor that sums up to n. The code also handles cases where there is no possible sequence by returning -1.
