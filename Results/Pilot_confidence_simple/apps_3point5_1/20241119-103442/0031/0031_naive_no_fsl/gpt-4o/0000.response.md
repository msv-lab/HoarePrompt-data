Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given scenario.
2. The program handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1 as the probability is guaranteed to be 1 in that case.
3. The program calculates the numerator and denominator modulo 10^6 + 3 to avoid overflow.
4. The program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of A and B using the func_1 function to ensure that A and B are coprime.
5. The program outputs the values of A and B as required in the problem description.
