Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates through the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
