Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, calculates the color counts of the Jedi Knights, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals to check if the desired color counts can be achieved. If such an interval is found, it sets the 'found' flag to True and prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program follows the problem description and logic correctly for all potential cases.
