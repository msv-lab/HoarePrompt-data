Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values and correctly implements the logic to determine if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It uses a sliding window approach to track the counts of each color and checks if the desired counts are met within the interval. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval exists and 'NO' otherwise. The implementation covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
