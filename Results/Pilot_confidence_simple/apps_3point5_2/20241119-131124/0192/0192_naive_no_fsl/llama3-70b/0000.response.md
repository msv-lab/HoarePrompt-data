Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which represents the minimum number of seconds needed to modify the sides of the triangle to reach the desired length. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and examples provided.
