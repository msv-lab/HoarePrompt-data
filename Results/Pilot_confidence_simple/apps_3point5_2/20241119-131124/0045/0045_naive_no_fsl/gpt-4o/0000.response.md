Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum sum of the sequence based on the number of elements in the sequence. It then checks if this minimum sum is greater than the given number n, and if so, returns -1 as there is no possible sequence. 
If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, the program proceeds to calculate the divisor d and the remainder. It then constructs the sequence by assigning d * (i + 1) to each element, where i ranges from 0 to k-1. 
The program then adjusts the sequence to ensure that the sum is equal to n by distributing the remainder, if any, among the elements in a way that maximizes their greatest common divisor. 
Finally, the program prints the resulting sequence or -1 if no valid sequence exists. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and handles the cases as described, making the logic correct.
