Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements of A and then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. The logic used in the program is correct and covers all potential cases. The program iterates over all possible divisors of the gcd and finds the maximum divisor that divides the gcd. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all cases.
