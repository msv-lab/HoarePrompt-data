Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes an integer input representing Tavas's score and converts it into words as described in the problem description. It handles all possible cases for the input score from 0 to 99. The logic for converting single-digit scores, teens, and tens is implemented correctly. Additionally, the output format of lowercase English letters and hyphens is also followed. Since the program covers all potential cases and produces the expected output, it can be considered correct.
