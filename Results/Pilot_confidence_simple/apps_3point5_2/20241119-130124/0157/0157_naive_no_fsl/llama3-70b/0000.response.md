Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It finds the minimum of the three quantities (lemons, apples/2, pears/4) and then calculates the total by adding the minimum lemons, twice the minimum apples, and four times the minimum pears, which satisfies the required ratio of 1:2:4 for the compote. The program works correctly for all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.
