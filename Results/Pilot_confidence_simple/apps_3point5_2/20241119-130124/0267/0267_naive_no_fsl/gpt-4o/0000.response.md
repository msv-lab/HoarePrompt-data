Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, which correctly check if a number contains at most k different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from l to r meeting this condition.
2. The program then reads input values for l, r, and k, calls func_2 with these values, and prints the result modulo 998244353.
3. The program iterates through all numbers in the range from l to r (inclusive), checks if each number satisfies the condition of having at most k different digits using func_1, and updates the total sum accordingly.
4. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers meeting the condition and returns the result.
5. The program works as expected for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
