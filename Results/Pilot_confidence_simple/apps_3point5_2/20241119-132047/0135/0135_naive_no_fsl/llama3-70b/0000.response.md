Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description. It takes input values for n and k, then iterates through each integer i from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. It keeps track of the remainders seen so far in a set and checks if the current remainder is already in the set. If it is, the program prints "No" and exits. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end. This logic ensures that the program accurately determines whether all remainders are distinct as required in the problem description. The program works correctly for all possible inputs and cases, making the correctness **True**.
