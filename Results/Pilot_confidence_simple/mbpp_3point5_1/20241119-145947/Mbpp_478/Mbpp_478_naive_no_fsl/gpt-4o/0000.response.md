Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is only removing lowercase characters from the string, but it is not removing lowercase substrings. For example, if we input 'aBCde', the program will return 'BC', but the correct output should be 'BC'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
