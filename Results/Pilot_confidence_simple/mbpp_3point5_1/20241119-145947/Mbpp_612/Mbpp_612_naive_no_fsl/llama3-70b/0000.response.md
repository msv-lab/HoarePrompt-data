Correctness: **True**

The program takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the first and second elements of each sublist and then creating a new list with these elements. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and works for all potential cases.
