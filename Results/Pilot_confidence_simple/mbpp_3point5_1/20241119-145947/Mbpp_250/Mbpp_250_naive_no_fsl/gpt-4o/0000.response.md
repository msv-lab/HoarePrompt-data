Correctness: True

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple and an element, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. The assertions provided in the program test the function with different cases and the expected results match the logic of the function. Since the function works as expected for all the provided test cases, the correctness of the program is True.
