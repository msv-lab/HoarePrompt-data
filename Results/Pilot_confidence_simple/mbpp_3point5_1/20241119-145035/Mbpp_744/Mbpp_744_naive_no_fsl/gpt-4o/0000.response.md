Correctness: True

The provided program correctly implements the function to check if the given tuple has any None value. It iterates through the tuple and returns True if it encounters a None value, otherwise it returns False. The assertions provided cover both cases where the tuple contains a None value and where it does not, and the program handles these cases correctly.
