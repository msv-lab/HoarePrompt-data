Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list as input and uses a list comprehension along with the `all()` function to check if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. This logic correctly determines whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The code iterates through each pair of elements in the list and checks if the current element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds true for all pairs, then the list is considered sorted. Since the logic covers all possible pairs of elements in the list, the program is correct for checking if a specified list is sorted or not.
