Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function that takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array using enumerate to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
