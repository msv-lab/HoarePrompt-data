Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The program achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate through each sublist in the input list and finding the length of each sublist. Finally, it uses the `max()` function to return the length of the longest sublist.

The program seems to correctly implement the problem description and there are no apparent edge cases where it would fail to find the length of the longest sublist. Hence, the correctness of the program is True.
