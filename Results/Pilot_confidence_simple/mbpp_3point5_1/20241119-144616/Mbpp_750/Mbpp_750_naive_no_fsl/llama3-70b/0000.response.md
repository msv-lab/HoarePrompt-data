Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the given list `lst`. This function correctly adds the given tuple to the given list as mentioned in the problem description. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned where this program would fail to meet the requirements, we can conclude that the program is correct.
