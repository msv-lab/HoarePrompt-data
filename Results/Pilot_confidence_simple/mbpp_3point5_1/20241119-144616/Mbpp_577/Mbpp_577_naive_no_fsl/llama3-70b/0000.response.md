Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program always returns 0 for any input greater than 4, which is not the correct behavior as per the problem description. For example, for input n=5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0, not 0 as returned by the program. Hence, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
