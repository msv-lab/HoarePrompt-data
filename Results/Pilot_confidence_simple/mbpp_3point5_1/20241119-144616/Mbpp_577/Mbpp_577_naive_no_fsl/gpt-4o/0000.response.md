Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. It always returns 0 if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, which is not correct. For example, func_1(21) should return 0 according to the program, but the correct last digit in the factorial of 21 is 0. Similarly, func_1(30) should return 0 according to the program, but the correct last digit in the factorial of 30 is 0. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
