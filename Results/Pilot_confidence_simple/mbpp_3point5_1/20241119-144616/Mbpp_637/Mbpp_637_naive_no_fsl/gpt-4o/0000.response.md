Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. The provided test cases cover scenarios where there is no profit or loss (cost price equals selling price), different cost and selling prices resulting in either profit or loss. In all cases, the function returns the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.
