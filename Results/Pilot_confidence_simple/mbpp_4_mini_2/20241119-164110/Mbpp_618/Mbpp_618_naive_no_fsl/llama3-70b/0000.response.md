Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where there are zero elements in `list2`. If `list2` contains a zero, this will result in a division by zero error. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` during the division operation. This means the program does not meet the requirement to divide two lists element-wise safely for all potential cases.
