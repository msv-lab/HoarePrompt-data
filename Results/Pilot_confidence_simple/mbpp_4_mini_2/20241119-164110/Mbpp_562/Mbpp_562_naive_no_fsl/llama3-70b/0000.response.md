To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the problem description and the code provided.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max((len(sublist) for sublist in lists))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality of the Program:** 
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (i.e., `lists`) as an input.
   - It uses a generator expression to calculate the lengths of each sublist in `lists`.
   - It then returns the maximum length found among these sublists.

2. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - If `lists` is an empty list, the program will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` cannot operate on an empty iterable.
   - If `lists` contains empty sublists, the function will still return `0`, which is the correct length for an empty sublist.
   - If all sublists are empty, the function will correctly return `0`.

### Conclusion on Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case where `lists` itself is an empty list, which is a valid input according to the problem description. For an empty input list, there is no sublist, and thus it does not make sense to ask for the length of the longest sublist.

Given that the program fails to correctly handle the case of an empty input list by producing an error instead of a return value, we can conclude that it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
