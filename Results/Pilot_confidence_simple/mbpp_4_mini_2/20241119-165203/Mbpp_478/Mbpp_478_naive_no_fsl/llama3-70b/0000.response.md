Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, it only retains uppercase characters and discards all lowercase characters without considering the requirement to remove lowercase substrings specifically. 

For example, consider the input string: `"HelloWorld"`. The expected behavior, as per the problem description, would be to remove the lowercase substrings (i.e., "ello", "orld") and return an empty string since they are lowercase. However, the program would return `"HW"` instead, which does not satisfy the problem requirements.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, it is incorrect.
