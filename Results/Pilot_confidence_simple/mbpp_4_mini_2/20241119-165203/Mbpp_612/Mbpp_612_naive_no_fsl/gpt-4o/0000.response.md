Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input provided in the third assertion. The input `[[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]], [[5], [6]], [[7], [8]]]` is a nested list where each sublist contains lists instead of single elements. The sublists in this input do not have exactly two elements as specified in the problem description (each sublist should have two elements). 

The program will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[1]` for sublists that only contain one element (like `[1]` and `[2]` in this case). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
