Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the maximum of two numbers. It uses a simple conditional expression to return the greater of the two input values `a` and `b`. 

The assertions included in the program test various scenarios:
1. `func_1(5, 10) == 10` checks if the function correctly identifies 10 as the maximum.
2. `func_1(-1, -2) == -1` verifies that the function correctly identifies -1 as the maximum of two negative numbers.
3. `func_1(9, 7) == 9` confirms that the function accurately identifies 9 as the maximum.

These tests cover positive numbers, negative numbers, and the general case of two distinct integers. Since all cases provided in the assertions work correctly, and there are no edge cases or scenarios that the code fails to handle, the program is deemed correct according to the problem description.
