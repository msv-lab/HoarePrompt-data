To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a Python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, a complex number is represented by its magnitude (absolute value) and phase (angle).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(c):
    return (abs(c), cmath.phase(c))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` takes a complex number `c` as input.
2. It uses `abs(c)` to compute the magnitude of the complex number, which is correct.
3. It uses `cmath.phase(c)` to compute the phase (angle) of the complex number, which is also correct.
4. The output is a tuple containing the magnitude and phase, which is the expected format for representing polar coordinates.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- Complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts (e.g., `1 + 1j`)
- Complex numbers with only a real part (e.g., `1`)
- Complex numbers with only an imaginary part (e.g., `1j`)
- Complex numbers that are purely negative (e.g., `-1` or `-1j`)
- The zero complex number (e.g., `0 + 0j`)

I need to verify if there are any cases where the program doesn't perform as expected:
- For example, when testing `0 + 0j`, the magnitude should be `0`, but the phase is typically undefined. The `cmath.phase(0)` will return `0`, which may not represent the true idea of the phase being undefined.

Since the program may yield an incorrect interpretation of the phase for the zero complex number, there is a potential failure case.

Given the analysis, I conclude that:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not appropriately handle the edge case of the zero complex number where the phase should not have a defined value.
