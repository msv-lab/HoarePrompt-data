Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle all potential inputs correctly. The function `func_1` is supposed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. However, the assertions only test the function with real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which are specific cases and do not cover complex numbers that have both real and imaginary parts.

For example, if we test the function with a complex number such as `1 + 1j`, the expected result is `(√2, π/4)` or approximately `(1.4142135623730951, 0.7853981633974483)`, but this case is not covered in the assertions. This indicates that the function may not work correctly for all valid input cases (i.e., complex numbers), which is a requirement based on the problem description. 

Since there are inputs (such as complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts) for which the function does not return the correct polar coordinates, the program is incorrect.
