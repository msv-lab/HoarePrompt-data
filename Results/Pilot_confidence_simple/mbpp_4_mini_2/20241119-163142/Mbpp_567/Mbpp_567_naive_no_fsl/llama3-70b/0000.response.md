Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression that iterates through the list, comparing each element to its successor. 

The logic checks if each element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1` for all valid indices. 

### Explanation:
1. **Empty List**: The function will return `True` for an empty list since there are no elements to compare.
2. **Single Element List**: The function will also return `True` for lists with a single element, as there are no pairs to compare.
3. **Sorted List**: For a list that is sorted in non-decreasing order, the comparisons will all be `True`, leading to a final `True` return value.
4. **Unsorted List**: The function will correctly return `False` for any list that is not sorted.

Given these points, I could not identify any edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the function behaves correctly across all potential cases.
