Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if there is neither profit nor loss based on the problem description. It compares the cost price and the selling price. If they are equal, it indicates no profit and no loss, which is the requirement. 

In every potential case:
- If the cost price is 100 and the selling price is 100, the function will return `True`.
- If the cost price is 100 and the selling price is 90, the function will return `False` (indicating a loss).
- If the cost price is 100 and the selling price is 110, the function will return `False` (indicating a profit).

The function covers all scenarios related to the problem statement, confirming that it behaves as expected. Thus, the program is correct.
