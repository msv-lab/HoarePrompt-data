Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

1. The inner function `is_prime` accurately checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2 and checking divisibility for numbers from 2 up to the square root of the number.
2. The outer function iterates through all numbers from 2 up to (but not including) `n`, and counts how many of those numbers are prime.
3. For `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function correctly returns `0` since there are no prime numbers less than those values.
4. For any other non-negative integer input, it effectively counts and returns the number of primes less than that integer.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the program is correct.
