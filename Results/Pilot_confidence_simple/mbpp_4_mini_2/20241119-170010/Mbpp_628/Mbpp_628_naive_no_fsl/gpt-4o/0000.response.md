Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The implementation uses the `replace` method of strings, which effectively achieves the desired outcome. 

The assertions provided cover a variety of cases:
1. A string with multiple spaces ("My Name is Dawood") is correctly transformed to "My%20Name%20is%20Dawood".
2. A string with spaces at regular intervals ("I am a Programmer") is successfully converted to "I%20am%20a%20Programmer".
3. A string that maintains spaces between words ("I love Coding") is transformed to "I%20love%20Coding".

Additionally, the program handles edge cases such as:
- Strings with no spaces (e.g., "HelloWorld") would remain unchanged.
- Strings that consist entirely of spaces (e.g., "    ") would be converted to "%20%20%20%20".

Since the program has been tested against these cases and functions correctly for all, there are no identified scenarios where it fails to meet the problem's requirements. Thus, the program is confirmed to be correct.
