Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining if a string is an "s-palindrome" as defined by the problem description. 

An "s-palindrome" is defined as being symmetric about the middle of the string. The program currently checks for mirrored characters from the beginning and the end of the string moving towards the center, which is typically how palindromes are checked. However, it fails to account for the definition of "s-palindrome," which specifically requires that each character in the first half of the string must be a mirror reflection of the corresponding character in the second half. 

For example, the string "oXoxoXo" should be considered an "s-palindrome" because it reads the same when reflected about its center. However, if we take the string "aA", while it might be considered a palindrome due to case-insensitivity in some contexts, it is not an "s-palindrome" as per the given definition because 'a' and 'A' are not mirror reflections of each other.

Additionally, itâ€™s important to note that the program does not handle cases where characters might need to be visually mirrored (as in, 'b' does not reflect to 'd', etc.). Thus, it would lead to incorrect results for strings containing such pairs.

Here is a counter-example:
- Input: "oXxXo"
- Expected Output: "NIE" (as 'X' does not reflect to 'x')
- Actual Output: "TAK"

Since the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
