To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, let's break down the logic implemented in the program against the expected outcomes described.

### Input:
The program reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing:
- `x`: number of people who will upvote
- `y`: number of people who will downvote
- `z`: number of people whose voting behavior is unknown (could either upvote or downvote)

### Expected Logic and Outcomes:
1. If `x > y + z`: Definitely more upvotes than downvotes, the output should be "+".
2. If `x < y`: Definitely more downvotes than upvotes, the output should be "-".
3. If `x == y`:
   - If `z == 0`: The votes are equal, so the output should be "0".
   - If `z > 0`: The outcome is uncertain as `z` could potentially tip the balance in either direction, so the output should be "?".
4. If none of the above conditions apply (which is logically impossible given the structure), we have an uncertain outcome.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Potential Cases:
Let's analyze various cases based on the structure:

1. **Case (3, 7, 0)**:
   - `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`: The code correctly outputs "-".
   
2. **Case (2, 0, 1)**:
   - `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`: The code correctly outputs "+".

3. **Case (1, 1, 0)**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`: The code correctly outputs "0".

4. **Case (0, 0, 1)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`: The code correctly outputs "?".

5. **Additional Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`: Here, the outcome could be "+" (if `z` votes up) or "-" (if `z` votes down). The code would output "?" which is correct.

6. **Additional Case (0, 2, 2)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 2`, `z = 2`: The outcome could be "-" (if both `z` vote down) or "?" (if `z` votes split). The code should output "?" which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Analyzing multiple potential input scenarios shows that the logic implemented in the code matches the expected outcomes based on the problem description. The code handles the edge cases correctly as well.

Correctness: **True** 

The program works correctly for all specified edge cases, producing the expected outputs as described in the problem statement.
