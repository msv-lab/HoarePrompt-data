Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fully handle the case where the input numbers have leading zeroes. While the program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes, it does not account for the scenario where both numbers become empty after leading zero removal. For example, if the inputs are:

```
000000
000000
```

After stripping leading zeroes, both `a` and `b` would become empty strings. The comparison `if a == b:` would then incorrectly evaluate to `True`, resulting in an output of `=`. However, semantically, both numbers are equal to `0`, which should also be handled appropriately.

Additionally, the program does not account for the scenario where only one number is zero. For instance:

```
0000
0
```

After stripping, both will become empty strings. Thus, the comparison logic fails to differentiate between actual values when both become empty.

Therefore, the program fails to produce the correct results for inputs consisting solely of zeroes or leading zeroes, making it incorrect.
