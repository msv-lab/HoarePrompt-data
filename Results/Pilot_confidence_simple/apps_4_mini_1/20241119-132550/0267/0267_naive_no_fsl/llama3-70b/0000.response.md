To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function Definition**: `func_1(l, r, k)` defines a helper function `count(n, k, dp)` to count how many numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive) contain at most `k` different digits.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - The function uses dynamic programming with memoization (using `dp`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function checks for edge cases, such as if `k` is `0`, and also handles range counts based on the number of digits.

3. **Mathematical Calculations**:
   - It appears to follow a formula to calculate the sum based on the number of digits and how they can be combined.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The results are taken modulo `998244353`, as specified in the problem statement.

### Potential Issues:

While the code seems to attempt to implement the logic as described, it does not explicitly check if the numbers between `l` and `r` themselves are being counted correctly, especially for cases where:
- `l` and `r` have different numbers of digits.
- The number of unique digits in numbers within the range may vary, especially when `k < 10`.

### Test Case for Failure:

Let's consider the following input:
- `l = 100`, `r = 150`, `k = 2`

For this range:
- Valid numbers that have at most 2 different digits include: `100, 101, 110, 111, 120, 121, 130, 131, 140, 141, 150`.
- The expected sum is: `100 + 101 + 110 + 111 + 120 + 121 + 130 + 131 + 140 + 141 + 150 = 1195`.

If the function `count` fails to enumerate and sum these correctly based on the unique digit constraint, it would yield an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:

There is a potential logical flaw in how the program counts and sums the valid numbers, particularly in edge cases where `l` and `r` straddle different digit lengths or have more complex configurations of digits. 

Thus, based on this analysis, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
