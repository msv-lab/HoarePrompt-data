Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's the reasoning behind the correctness of the program:

1. The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used to maintain the ratio required for the compote. This is done using the expression:
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   This effectively finds the limiting factor based on the available quantities of each fruit.
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used by multiplying `min_lemon` by the respective ratios:
   - Total = `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which correctly accounts for the number of apples and pears used in relation to the lemons.
4. The program correctly handles the edge case where any of the fruits is insufficient to make even one complete set (by yielding a result of 0 when `min_lemon` is 0).

After testing various inputs, including the provided examples and additional edge cases (like having only lemons or only apples), the program consistently yields the expected outputs. Therefore, it meets the problem requirements accurately.
