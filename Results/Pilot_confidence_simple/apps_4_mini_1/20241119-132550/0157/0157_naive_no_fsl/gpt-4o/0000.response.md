Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements as outlined in the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used to make the compote based on the given ratios of lemons, apples, and pears.

Here's an explanation of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used by finding the minimum of:
   - The available lemons (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples (`b // 2`), since for every lemon, two apples are needed.
   - A quarter of the number of pears (`c // 4`), since for every lemon, four pears are needed.
3. The program then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the maximum number of lemons. The total fruits are calculated as:
   - 1 lemon * `max_lemons`
   - 2 apples * `max_lemons`
   - 4 pears * `max_lemons`
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program has been verified against the provided examples, and it produces the correct output in all cases. Additionally, the logic ensures that any potential edge cases, such as not having enough of at least one type of fruit to make even one complete set, are handled correctly (it will return 0 in such cases).

Therefore, I found no flaws in the program, confirming its correctness according to the problem description.
