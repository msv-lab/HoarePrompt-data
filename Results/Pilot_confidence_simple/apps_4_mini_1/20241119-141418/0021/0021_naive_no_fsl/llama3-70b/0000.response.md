Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to achieve the goal of maximizing the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements after exactly one swap. 

### Issue:
1. The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` is flawed. The logic `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the maximum distance should be computed based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements directly rather than subtracting them or using arbitrary constants.
2. The program fails to consider whether the swap actually results in a maximum distance based on their original locations. For example:
   - If the input is `2 1` (where 1 is at index 1 and 2 is at index 0), the expected output should be `1` after swapping. However, it will not produce this because the logic does not correctly evaluate the positions for all cases.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 4 3 2
```
- Here, the minimum is `1` (at index 0) and the maximum is `4` (at index 1). 
- The maximum distance should be achievable by swapping `4` (index 1) with `2` (index 3).
- The output should be `3`, but the current implementation would yield an incorrect or undefined result due to the flawed logic.

Thus, since the program does not account for all edge cases and does not guarantee the correct output according to the problem description, the correctness is deemed false.
