To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to evaluate its logic against the problem description provided.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) of a permutation of integers from 1 to n by performing a single swap.
2. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between the indices of these two elements after the swap.

### Program Breakdown:
The program does the following:
1. Reads an integer `n` representing the size of the permutation.
2. Reads a list of `n` distinct integers (the permutation).
3. Finds the indices of the minimum (`1`) and maximum (`n`) elements.
4. Calculates the potential distances by considering swapping with the first and last elements of the list.
5. Prints the maximum distance obtained from these calculated distances.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program considers swapping both the minimum and maximum element with the first and last elements, but it does not take into account the effect of swapping the minimum with the maximum directly.
- For example, if the permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`, the min is at index 1 and max is at index 0. The expected output should be 2 (by swapping 3 and 2), but the program would incorrectly compute the output as 2 as well, by considering the distances incorrectly since it does not properly consider the swaps.

### Counterexample:
Consider the permutation `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The minimum `1` is at index `1`, and the maximum `3` is at index `0`.
- If we swap `3` with `2`, we would get `[2, 1, 3]`, which puts minimum and maximum at indices `1` and `2`, respectively. The distance is `|1 - 2| = 1`.
- The program, however, calculates distances related to edges only and would give a maximum distance of `1` when it should evaluate all possible beneficial swaps leading to a maximum distance.

Thus, the program does not fully cover the necessary logic of evaluating the distances after performing a swap, particularly when the swap involves the maximum being swapped directly with the minimum or any other element efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle all potential scenarios and could produce incorrect outputs in certain cases, we conclude that it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
