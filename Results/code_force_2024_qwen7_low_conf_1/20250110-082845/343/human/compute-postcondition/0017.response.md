The code `prev = x` assigns the value of `x` to `prev`. This means the value of `prev` changes to the current value of `x`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with at least one element remaining, `prev` is equal to `x`, `idx` is `initial_idx`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is `x`, otherwise `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2**
