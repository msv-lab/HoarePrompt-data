The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Given the initial state where `sm` is `a[j]`, `cts` is `[0, 0]`, `i` is the length of `a` + 1, and `j` is the length of `a`, the value of `sm` is `a[j]`.

After executing the code, `cts` will become `[0, 0, a[j]]` because `a[j]` is appended to the existing list `cts`.

Output State: **`sm` is `a[j]`, `cts` is `[0, 0, a[j]]`, `i` is the length of `a` + 1, `j` is the length of `a`**
