The code `sm = sm + a[j]` tries to add the value of `a[j]` to `sm`. However, the initial state does not define the list `a` or the value of `j`. Since `j` is set to the length of `a` + 1, and lists in Python are zero-indexed, accessing `a[j]` would result in an `IndexError` because there is no element at index `j` (which is out of bounds). Given the initial state, the value of `sm` remains unchanged as the operation cannot be performed due to the out-of-bounds access.

Output State: **`sm` is 0, `cts` is [0], `i` is the length of `a` + 1, `j` is the length of `a` + 1**
