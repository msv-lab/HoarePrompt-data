Postcondition: ***`odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with at least one element remaining. `prev` is equal to the next element in `odds`, `idx` is `initial_idx`. If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.***
