Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is determined as follows: if `i` is the middle index, then `a[i] = x`, otherwise `a[n - 1 - i] = (x - prev) // 2`, with `prev` being the last processed `x` and `idx` starting from \((n - 1) // 2\) and decrementing until it reaches \(-1\); `a` is returned**
