The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, and `n`, which is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(n\) is odd (to ensure a palindrome can be formed).

The function constructs a list `a` of length `n` based on the given conditions and returns it. Specifically, if `i` is the middle index, then `a[i] = x`, otherwise `a[n - 1 - i] = (x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the last processed `x` and `idx` starts from \((n - 1) // 2\) and decrements until it reaches \(-1\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n`, and return a list `a` of length `n` constructed according to specified rules.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `a` of length `n` constructed based on specified rules.**
