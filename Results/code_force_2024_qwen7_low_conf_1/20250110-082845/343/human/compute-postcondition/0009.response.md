Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with all its elements removed (i.e., an empty list), `smallList` is a list of integers with all its elements removed (i.e., an empty list)**

Explanation:
- Initially, both `bigList` and `smallList` contain subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`.
- The loop continues to execute as long as both lists have at least one element and the last elements of both lists are equal.
- With each iteration, the last elements of both `bigList` and `smallList` are removed.
- Since the loop continues to execute until the last elements are no longer equal or one of the lists is empty, the loop will continue until both lists are empty.
- Therefore, after the loop has finished executing, both `bigList` and `smallList` will be empty lists.
