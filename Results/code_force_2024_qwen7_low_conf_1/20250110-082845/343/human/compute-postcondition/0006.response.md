To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.
- `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.

For the loop to continue executing, both conditions within the `while` statement must be true:
1. `len(smallList) > 0`
2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

### Analysis of Conditions:
1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition checks if there are still elements left in `smallList`.
   - To ensure this condition is true for the next iteration, `smallList` must have at least one element left. 

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition checks if the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal.
   - For the loop to continue, these last elements must be equal.

Given the current state where:
- `bigList` has its last element removed.
- `smallList` has its last element removed.

To satisfy the second condition (`bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`), the last elements of both lists must match. Since both lists have had their last elements removed, the last elements before removal must be equal. Therefore, we need to ensure that the last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` were equal.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `smallList` must have at least one element left, which means it must have more than one element before the last element was removed.
- The last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

### Final State:
- `bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.
- `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, and it must have at least one element left (i.e., its length must be greater than 0).
- The last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed and its length must be greater than 0, and the last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal**.
