Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with at least one element remaining.
   - `prev` is equal to `x`.
   - `idx` is `initial_idx - 1`.
   - If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is `x`.
   - Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in odds:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `odds`.
   - After processing an element `x`, the variable `prev` becomes equal to `x`.
   - The variable `idx` is set to `initial_idx - 1`.
   - Depending on the condition, either `a[idx]` or `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are moving to the next element in the list `odds`, the new value of `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - Therefore, `prev` will be set to this new value of `x`.
   - `idx` will remain as `initial_idx - 1` until it changes during the loop execution based on the condition.

5. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in the list `odds`.
   - `idx` should not have been updated to `n - 1` yet, meaning the condition `idx == n - 1 - idx` has not been met, or if it has, the next element in `odds` still needs to be processed.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `odds` will now be the list `odds` without the first element (the one just processed).
   - `prev` will be the next element in `odds`.
   - `idx` will remain `initial_idx - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
- `odds` should be the list `odds` without the first element.
- `prev` should be the next element in `odds`.
- `idx` remains `initial_idx - 1`.

**State:**
**`odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with at least one element remaining, `prev` is equal to the next element in `odds`, `idx` is `initial_idx - 1`**
