Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is determined based on the following conditions: if `i == (n - 1 - i)` (i.e., `i` is the middle index of the list), then `a[i]` is equal to the last element processed by the loop (`x`). Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - i]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`. The value of `prev` is the last `x` processed by the loop, and `idx` starts from \((n - 1) // 2\) and decrements until it reaches \(-1\). `odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with no elements remaining after the loop completes.**
