The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since the last element of `bigList` was the same as the last element of `smallList`, removing the last element from `bigList` means that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal. However, the condition that `smallList` has a length greater than 0 still holds.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed and its length must be greater than 0; the last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal**
