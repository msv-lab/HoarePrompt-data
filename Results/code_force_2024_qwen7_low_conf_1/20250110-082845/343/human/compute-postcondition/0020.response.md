`a[idx]` is assigned the value `x`. The value of `idx` and the previous value of `a[idx]` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that the value at index `idx` in list `a` has been updated to `x`.

Output State: **the value at index `idx` in list `a` is now `x`.**
