Output State: **`sm` is the sum of elements from index `i` to the end of list `a`, `cts` is a list containing `sm` for each iteration starting from `i` to the end of list `a`, `i` is the length of `a` + 1, `j` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` being the length of `a` + 1, which means it doesn't enter the loop because the condition `j < len(a)` is never met.
- Since the loop does not execute, `sm` remains 0 and `cts` remains an empty list.
- After all iterations (which in this case is none), `i` becomes the length of `a` + 1, and `j` is undefined because the loop body is never executed.

Given this, the final state of the variables after the loop finishes executing (or rather, does not execute) is as described above.
