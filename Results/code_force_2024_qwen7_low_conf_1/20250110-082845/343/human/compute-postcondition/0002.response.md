`smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` such that `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the operation. The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. The last element of `smallList` is the same as the last element of `bigList`.

After executing `smallList.pop()`, the last element of `smallList` no longer exists, but the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is no longer valid since the last element of `smallList` has been removed.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, with the last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` such that `len(smallList) > 0`, but the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is no longer valid.**
