The code updates the value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` to `(x - prev) // 2`. According to the initial state, `a[idx]` was updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, which means `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now also set to the same value.

Therefore, the only change is that `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now equal to `(x - prev) // 2`.

Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums except one, with at least one element remaining, `prev` is equal to the next element in `odds`, `idx` is `initial_idx`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`**
