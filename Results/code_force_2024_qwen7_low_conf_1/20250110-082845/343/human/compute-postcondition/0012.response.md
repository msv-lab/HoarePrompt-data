Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList`, which is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and `smallList`, which is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. 

The function iterates through both lists, removing the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` as long as their last elements are equal. This process continues until either `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are not equal.

After the loop, the function attempts to return `bigList[-1]`, but since `bigList` is emptied during the loop, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases:
1. If `bigList` or `smallList` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and the function immediately returns `None`.
2. If the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are never equal, the loop will continue until one of the lists is exhausted, and then `bigList` will be empty, resulting in the function returning `None`.

Missing functionality: The function does not check if `smallList` has more elements than `bigList` before starting the loop, which could lead to an error if `smallList` is longer. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the given annotations.**

The final state of the program after it concludes is that both `bigList` and `smallList` are empty lists, and the function returns `None`.**
