The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of positive integers. The length of the list is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array of size \(n\). The function returns a sorted list of all possible sums of subarrays of `a`, starting from any index to the end of the list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `a` of positive integers and return a sorted list of all possible sums of subarrays starting from any index to the end of the list.
