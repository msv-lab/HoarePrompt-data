Postcondition: ***`a` is a list. If the index `idx` is exactly in the middle of the list (i.e., `idx == n - 1 - idx`), then the value at index `idx` is now `x`. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 1 - idx` in list `a` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, while `idx`, `x`, and `prev` remain unchanged.***
