`smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `smallList` originally had its last element removed, removing one more element means `smallList` now has one less element than before, and its length is now one less than the length of the original `smallList`.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed and its length is one less than the original length of `smallList`; the last elements of the original `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal**
