The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from the `smallList`. Since `smallList` originally contains subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, removing the last element means we no longer have that specific subarray sum.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with its last element removed.**
