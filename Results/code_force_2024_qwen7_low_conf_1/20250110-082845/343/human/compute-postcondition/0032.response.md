`cts.append(sm)` appends the value of `sm` (which is 0) to the list `cts`. The original list `cts` was `[0]`, so after appending, `cts` becomes `[0, 0]`. The values of `sm`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is 0, `cts` is [0, 0], `i` is the length of `a` + 1, `j` is the length of `a` + 1**
