The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from the list `bigList`. Since `bigList` initially contains a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and after executing the code, the last element (which is `bigList[-1]`) is removed, the updated state of `bigList` will have one less element. 

The precondition that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` remains valid because removing the last element from `bigList` does not affect the relationship between the elements of `bigList` and `smallList` as long as `smallList` also loses its last element. However, since the problem does not explicitly state that `smallList` should be modified, we only focus on the changes to `bigList`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` such that `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the operation, and now `bigList[-1]` no longer exists.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, with the last element removed; `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` such that `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the operation.**
