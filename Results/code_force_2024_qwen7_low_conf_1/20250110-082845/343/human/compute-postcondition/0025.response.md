`idx` is decremented by 1. This changes the value of `idx` but does not affect the value of `a`, `prev`, or `x`. The condition mentioned in the initial state also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list. If the index `idx` is exactly in the middle of the list (i.e., `idx == n - 1 - idx`), then the value at index `idx` is now `x`. Otherwise, the element at index `n - 1 - idx` in list `a` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, `prev` is now equal to `x`, `idx` is decreased by 1, and `x` remains unchanged.**
