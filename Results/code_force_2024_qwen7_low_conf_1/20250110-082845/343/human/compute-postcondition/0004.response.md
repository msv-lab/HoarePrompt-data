The `pop` method is called on `bigList`, which removes the last element from `bigList`. The other elements in both `bigList` and `smallList` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` and must have at least one element.**
