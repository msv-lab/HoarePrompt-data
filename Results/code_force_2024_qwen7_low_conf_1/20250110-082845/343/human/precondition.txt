a is a list of positive integers where the length of the list is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and the list represents a palindrome. Additionally, the function is provided with \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) subarray sums of the list a in arbitrary order, and it is guaranteed that there is always at least one valid solution for the array a.
