The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` containing integers and an integer `n` such that `3 <= n <= 1000` and `n` is odd. It constructs and returns a list `a` of length `n`. Each element `a[i]` in the list is determined based on the following rules:
1. If `i` is the middle index of the list (i.e., `i == (n - 1) // 2`), then `a[i]` is assigned the current value of `x` (the last processed element from `odds`).
2. For all other indices `i`, `a[n - 1 - i]` is set to half the difference between the current value of `x` and the previous value of `prev`.

The function iterates over the elements of `odds` in reverse order, updating the list `a` according to these rules. After processing all elements in `odds`, the function returns the list `a`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that `n` is always an odd integer between 3 and 1000. There is no explicit validation for this precondition, so if `n` is even or outside the specified range, the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where `odds` is an empty list. In this scenario, the function would still create an array of size `n` filled with zeros, which might not be the desired behavior.
