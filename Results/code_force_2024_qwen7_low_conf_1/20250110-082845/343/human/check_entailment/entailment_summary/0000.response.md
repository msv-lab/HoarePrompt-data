Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves recovering a palindrome array `a` given all but one of its subarray sums. The solution uses several functions to process these subarray sums and reconstruct the original palindrome array.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes all possible subarray sums of a given list and returns them sorted. This function is used to generate a comprehensive list of subarray sums for further analysis.
   - **func_2**: Identifies unique sums by removing consecutive duplicates. This helps in identifying the missing sum.
   - **func_3**: Constructs a potential palindrome array from the identified unique sums. It ensures that the generated array is symmetric.
   - **func_4**: Removes matching last elements from two lists and returns the last remaining element of the first list. This function is used to identify the missing subarray sum.

3. **Key Steps in the Main Program**:
   - Compute all subarray sums using `func_1`.
   - Identify unique sums using `func_2` to find the missing sum.
   - Use the missing sum to construct a palindrome array using `func_3` and `func_4`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The main program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately by ensuring that the generated palindrome array is valid and that the missing sum is correctly identified.
   - The logic to handle different scenarios (e.g., when `odds` has more odd or even elements) is well-defined.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided execution summaries and function descriptions confirm that the program follows a logical and consistent approach to solving the problem.
   - The main program uses the output of each function as expected, and the final palindrome array is correctly constructed.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be designed and implemented correctly to solve the given problem under the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
