### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires reconstructing a palindrome array \(a\) from given subarray sums, excluding one.
   - A palindrome array \(a\) satisfies \(a_i = a_{n + 1 - i}\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).

2. **Reconstruction Process**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums by removing consecutive duplicates. However, the logic here might not be sufficient to identify the missing subarray sum directly.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array \(a\) from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome.
   - **Function `func_4`**: This function is not utilized in the main logic and appears to be an unnecessary and incorrect function.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Correctly generates all subarray sums.
   - **Function `func_2`**: The logic for identifying unique subarray sums is flawed. It only removes consecutive duplicates, which is not sufficient to identify the missing subarray sum. For example, if the subarray sums are \([1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\), `func_2` would output \([1, 2, 3]\) instead of the correct unique sums \([1, 2, 3]\) without duplicates.
   - **Function `func_3`**: Correctly reconstructs the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums.
   - **Function `func_4`**: Not used and likely incorrect, as it attempts to remove elements from both lists but returns `None` when the lists are empty.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - The main logic in the annotated code uses `func_2` to find the missing subarray sum, but the logic in `func_2` is incorrect. It should compare the sums with the previous unique sum and remove the duplicates accordingly.
   - The logic in the annotated code to determine the missing sum is also flawed. It incorrectly handles cases where `odds` have more than one unique sum and uses `func_3` and `func_4` inappropriately.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to identify the missing subarray sum. Therefore, the final verdict is:

### Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation in `func_2` and the incorrect handling of the missing sum identification.
