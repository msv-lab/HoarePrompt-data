Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions do not correctly recover a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Test Case
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  7 2 2 7
  ```

### Analysis of the Provided Functions
1. **func_1(a):**
   - This function computes the list of all subarray sums for a given array `a`.
   - However, it does not actually solve the problem since it just generates subarray sums without using the given subarray sums to reconstruct the array.

2. **func_2(cts):**
   - This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums from the sorted list `cts`.
   - It does not handle the logic required to deduce the original palindrome array `a`.

3. **func_3(odds, n):**
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the remaining unique subarray sums `odds`.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly deduce the values of the array elements. For instance, it does not ensure that the values form a palindrome.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
   - This function seems unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Specific Issue
Let's consider the example test case again. Given the subarray sums:
```
18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9
```
These sums correspond to the following subarrays:
- 18: [7, 2, 2, 7]
- 2: [2]
- 11: [7, 4, 3, 7], [2, 4, 5]
- 9: [2, 7], [4, 5]
- 7: [7], [2, 5], [4, 3]
- 11: [7, 4, 3, 7], [2, 4, 5]
- 7: [7], [2, 5], [4, 3]
- 2: [2]
- 9: [2, 7], [4, 5]

From these sums, we can see that the subarray `[7, 2, 2, 7]` has a sum of 18, which is the largest sum. The unique sums provided are 18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9. The function does not correctly deduce that the array must be `[7, 2, 2, 7]`.

### Conclusion
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
