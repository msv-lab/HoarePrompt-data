### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to reconstruct a palindrome array \(a\) from the given subarray sums, except for one. The subarray sums provided do not include the sum of one of the subarrays of \(a\).

2. **Reconstruction Process**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array \(a\) and returns them sorted. This part is correct.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums by comparing each sum to the last element in the list `odds`. If the current sum is the same as the last unique sum, it means the current sum has already been counted and should be removed from the list. However, this function is not entirely correct because it does not handle cases where the last element of `odds` is a duplicate correctly. Instead, it should handle duplicates more effectively to ensure only unique sums are kept.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array \(a\) from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome. However, the implementation assumes that the unique subarray sums will directly help in constructing the palindrome array, which is not always true. The logic in `func_3` does not guarantee that the constructed array will always be a palindrome.
   - **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the problem and is likely an error in the provided code. It incorrectly attempts to remove elements from `bigList` and `smallList` until they are not equal, and then returns the last element of `bigList`, which will always be `None`.

Given the above analysis, the functions provided have significant issues in handling the unique subarray sums and reconstructing the palindrome array correctly. Specifically, `func_2` and `func_3` do not handle duplicates and unique sums correctly, and `func_4` is not utilized and incorrectly implemented.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not ensure that the unique subarray sums are handled correctly, and `func_4` is incorrectly implemented and not utilized.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
**False**
