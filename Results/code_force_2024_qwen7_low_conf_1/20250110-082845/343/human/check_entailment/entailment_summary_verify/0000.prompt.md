You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `bigList`, which is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and `smallList`, which is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. 

The function iterates through both lists, removing the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` as long as their last elements are equal. This process continues until either `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are not equal.

After the loop, the function attempts to return `bigList[-1]`, but since `bigList` is emptied during the loop, it returns `None`.

Potential edge cases:
1. If `bigList` or `smallList` is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and the function immediately returns `None`.
2. If the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are never equal, the loop will continue until one of the lists is exhausted, and then `bigList` will be empty, resulting in the function returning `None`.

Missing functionality: The function does not check if `smallList` has more elements than `bigList` before starting the loop, which could lead to an error if `smallList` is longer. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the given annotations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions do not correctly recover a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Test Case
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  18 2 11 9 7 11 7 2 9
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  7 2 2 7
  ```

### Analysis of the Provided Functions
1. **func_1(a):**
   - This function computes the list of all subarray sums for a given array `a`.
   - However, it does not actually solve the problem since it just generates subarray sums without using the given subarray sums to reconstruct the array.

2. **func_2(cts):**
   - This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums from the sorted list `cts`.
   - It does not handle the logic required to deduce the original palindrome array `a`.

3. **func_3(odds, n):**
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the remaining unique subarray sums `odds`.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not correctly deduce the values of the array elements. For instance, it does not ensure that the values form a palindrome.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
   - This function seems unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Specific Issue
Let's consider the example test case again. Given the subarray sums:
```
18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9
```
These sums correspond to the following subarrays:
- 18: [7, 2, 2, 7]
- 2: [2]
- 11: [7, 4, 3, 7], [2, 4, 5]
- 9: [2, 7], [4, 5]
- 7: [7], [2, 5], [4, 3]
- 11: [7, 4, 3, 7], [2, 4, 5]
- 7: [7], [2, 5], [4, 3]
- 2: [2]
- 9: [2, 7], [4, 5]

From these sums, we can see that the subarray `[7, 2, 2, 7]` has a sum of 18, which is the largest sum. The unique sums provided are 18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9. The function does not correctly deduce that the array must be `[7, 2, 2, 7]`.

### Conclusion
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
