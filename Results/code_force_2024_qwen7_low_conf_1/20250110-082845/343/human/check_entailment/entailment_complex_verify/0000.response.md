### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the issues with the provided functions. Here is a detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is correct:

1. **func_1(a)**:
   - This function generates all possible subarray sums of a given list `a`. While it correctly computes the subarray sums, it doesn't use this information to reconstruct the original palindrome array. The function does not account for the fact that the given sums are incomplete and must be used to deduce the palindrome array.

2. **func_2(cts)**:
   - This function removes consecutive duplicates from the list of subarray sums. This step is unnecessary and does not help in reconstructing the palindrome array. It simply processes the subarray sums but does not utilize them in a way that helps deduce the original array.

3. **func_3(odds, n)**:
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array from the remaining unique subarray sums. However, the logic used in this function is flawed. It does not correctly deduce the values of the array elements to ensure the resulting array is a palindrome. For instance, the given code does not properly handle the distribution of values to ensure symmetry around the center of the array.

4. **func_4(bigList, smallList)**:
   - This function is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem. It attempts to remove elements from both lists based on equality, but this is not relevant to the task of reconstructing the palindrome array.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
