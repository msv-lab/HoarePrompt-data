### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums, except for one. The subarray sums provided do not include the sum of one of the subarrays of `a`.

2. **Reconstruction Process**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums by comparing each sum to the last element in the list `odds`. If the current sum is the same as the last unique sum, it means the current sum has already been counted and should be removed from the list.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome.
   - **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the problem and is likely an error in the provided code.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Generates all subarray sums correctly. However, it does not handle the case where `a` is empty. If `a` is empty, `func_1` will return an empty list, which is not expected as there should be at least one subarray sum provided in the input.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Identifies the unique subarray sums correctly by ensuring no duplicates are kept. However, it does not handle the case where `cts` is empty. In this case, `func_2` will return an empty list, which could lead to issues later in the program.
   - **Function `func_3`**: Reconstructs the palindrome array `a` correctly by setting the middle element and ensuring the rest of the array is mirrored around the middle. However, it does not handle the case where `odds` is empty. In this scenario, `func_3` will create an array of zeros, which might not be the desired behavior.

4. **Handling Missing Subarray Sum**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the number of unique subarray sums is greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\). It identifies the missing sum and reconstructs the palindrome array accordingly.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the number of unique subarray sums is less than or equal to \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\). In such cases, the program may produce an incorrect result because it relies on the assumption that the missing sum can be derived from the existing sums.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as when `n` is even or when `a` is an empty list. These scenarios need to be explicitly handled to ensure the program behaves correctly in all cases.

### Conclusion:
While the functions seem to address the main aspects of the problem, there are several edge cases and potential issues that need to be addressed. The program assumes certain conditions that may not always hold true, leading to potential errors or incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**
