### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to recover a palindrome array \(a\) of size \(n\) from given subarray sums, excluding one.
   - The function `func_1` calculates all possible subarray sums starting from any index to the end of the list.
   - `func_2` removes consecutive duplicates from the list of subarray sums.
   - `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome array from the modified list of subarray sums.
   - `func_4` attempts to find the missing subarray sum by comparing two lists of subarray sums.

2. **Analysis of Each Function:**
   - **`func_1`:** Correctly calculates and sorts all subarray sums.
   - **`func_2`:** Correctly removes consecutive duplicates from the list of subarray sums.
   - **`func_3`:** Constructs the palindrome array based on the modified list of subarray sums. It correctly places the middle element and the symmetric elements around it.
   - **`func_4`:** This function is problematic. It incorrectly attempts to find the missing sum by comparing the last elements of two lists, which may not always yield the correct result. This function should ideally be revised to correctly identify the missing sum based on the properties of the palindrome and the given subarray sums.

3. **Review of the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program seems to handle most cases correctly. However, the reliance on `func_4` to find the missing sum introduces a flaw. Given that `func_4` does not reliably identify the missing sum, it leads to potential incorrect outputs.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately for `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - The primary issue lies in `func_4`, which fails to accurately identify the missing sum in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:

Given that `func_4` is flawed and may not always correctly identify the missing subarray sum, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the provided annotations and the logical flow.

### Response:

Correctness: **False**
