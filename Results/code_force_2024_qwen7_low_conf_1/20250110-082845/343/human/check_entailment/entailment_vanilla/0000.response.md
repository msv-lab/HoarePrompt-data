### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to reconstruct a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums, except for one. The subarray sums provided do not include the sum of one of the subarrays of `a`.

2. **Reconstruction Process**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies the unique subarray sums by comparing each sum to the last element in the list `odds`. If the current sum is the same as the last unique sum, it means the current sum has already been counted and should be removed from the list.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums `odds`. It ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome.
   - **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the problem and is likely an error in the provided code.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Generates all subarray sums correctly.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Identifies the unique subarray sums correctly by ensuring no duplicates are kept.
   - **Function `func_3`**: Reconstructs the palindrome array correctly by setting the middle element and ensuring the rest of the array is mirrored around the middle.

Given the above analysis, the functions provided seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The given program is designed to solve the problem correctly, although `func_4` is not utilized and could be removed.

**Correctness: **True**
