Reasoning:
1. The program reads all input data at once and then processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly identifies the size of the array \( n \) and reads the array \( a \).
3. It then computes the minimum and maximum values of the array \( a \).
4. The expression \( 4 \times (max(a) - min(a)) \) is calculated correctly, which is the maximum possible value of the given expression for any set of distinct indices \( i, j, k, l \).
5. The results are printed correctly, one per line, for each test case.

Given that the logic and the implementation follow the problem's requirements accurately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
