### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program's functionality and verified its correctness based on the problem statement. Let's systematically evaluate the program using the annotated version to confirm the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct and efficient for handling large inputs.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it extracts the size `n` of the array and the array elements `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The initialization of `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity is correct to ensure they capture the actual minimum and maximum values in the array.
   - The loop to iterate through the array to update `min_val` and `max_val` is correct.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - The calculation `4 * (max_val - min_val)` is correct. This formula ensures that the maximum possible value of the expression is achieved by taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array and multiplying by 4.
   - The reasoning behind this formula is sound because the absolute differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the range of values in the array is maximized.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end, which is correct.

### Verification:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the data and processing each one individually.
   - It correctly extracts the size `n` and the array elements for each test case.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` is mathematically sound and directly follows the problem statement.
   - Since the expression depends only on the minimum and maximum values of the array, this approach is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases like arrays with identical elements (resulting in a zero difference) and arrays with both positive and negative values.
   - The provided examples and constraints ensure that the program can handle such cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program with the annotated version and verifying each step against the problem description and constraints, we can confirm that the program is indeed correct.

**Final: True**
