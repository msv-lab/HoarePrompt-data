Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates the maximum value of the expression as \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\), which is not the correct approach according to the problem description.

The problem requires finding the maximum value of the expression:
\[ |a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i| \]
for all distinct indices \(i, j, k, l\) such that \(1 \leq i, j, k, l \leq n\).

The current implementation only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not sufficient to maximize the expression. To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to evaluate all possible combinations of \(i, j, k,\) and \(l\) and compute the expression for each combination, keeping track of the maximum value encountered.

Since the provided program does not implement this necessary logic and instead simplifies the problem to a linear relationship, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
