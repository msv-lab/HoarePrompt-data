Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by reading input from stdin and processing multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis to verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case separately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the size `n` of the array and the array elements `a`.
   - It initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the array.
   - It iterates through the array to update `min_val` and `max_val`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - After determining the minimum and maximum values, it calculates the maximum value of the expression as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Verification:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the data and processing each one individually.
   - It correctly extracts the size `n` and the array elements for each test case.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` is mathematically sound and directly follows the problem statement.
   - Since the expression depends only on the minimum and maximum values of the array, this approach is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases like arrays with identical elements (resulting in a zero difference) and arrays with both positive and negative values.
   - The provided examples and constraints ensure that the program can handle such cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
