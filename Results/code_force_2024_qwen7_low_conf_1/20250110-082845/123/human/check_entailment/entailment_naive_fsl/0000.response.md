Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the given problem description. The program calculates `4 * (max_val - min_val)` instead of evaluating the expression for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`. This approach only considers the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not account for the absolute differences between all pairs of elements.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

Input:
```
5
4
1 1 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is correct for this specific example because all elements are the same, resulting in zero for any combination. However, the program does not handle other cases correctly. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

But the program outputs:
```
6
```

This is correct for this example as well, but it is due to chance rather than the correct implementation. The program needs to evaluate all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l` to ensure it finds the maximum value of the expression.

Since the program does not implement the required logic to evaluate all combinations, it is incorrect for the general case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
