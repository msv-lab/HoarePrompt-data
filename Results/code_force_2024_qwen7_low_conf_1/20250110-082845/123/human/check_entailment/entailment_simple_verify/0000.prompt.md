You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        results.append(max_expression_value)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the given problem description. The program calculates `4 * (max_val - min_val)` instead of evaluating the expression for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l`. This approach only considers the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not account for the absolute differences between all pairs of elements.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:

Input:
```
5
4
1 1 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is correct for this specific example because all elements are the same, resulting in zero for any combination. However, the program does not handle other cases correctly. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

But the program outputs:
```
6
```

This is correct for this example as well, but it is due to chance rather than the correct implementation. The program needs to evaluate all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l` to ensure it finds the maximum value of the expression.

Since the program does not implement the required logic to evaluate all combinations, it is incorrect for the general case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
