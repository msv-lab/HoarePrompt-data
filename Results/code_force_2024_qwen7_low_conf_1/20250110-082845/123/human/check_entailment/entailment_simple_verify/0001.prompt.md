You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        results.append(max_expression_value)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by reading input from stdin and processing multiple test cases. Here's a step-by-step analysis to verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case separately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the size `n` of the array and the array elements `a`.
   - It initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity to keep track of the minimum and maximum values in the array.
   - It iterates through the array to update `min_val` and `max_val`.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - After determining the minimum and maximum values, it calculates the maximum value of the expression as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for all test cases are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Verification:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the data and processing each one individually.
   - It correctly extracts the size `n` and the array elements for each test case.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the maximum value of the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` is mathematically sound and directly follows the problem statement.
   - Since the expression depends only on the minimum and maximum values of the array, this approach is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases like arrays with identical elements (resulting in a zero difference) and arrays with both positive and negative values.
   - The provided examples and constraints ensure that the program can handle such cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
