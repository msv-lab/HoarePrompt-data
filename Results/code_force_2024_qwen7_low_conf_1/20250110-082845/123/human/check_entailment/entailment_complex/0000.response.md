Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself from the input. This part of the program correctly handles the input format as specified.

2. **Finding Min and Max Values**:
   - Inside each test case, the program initializes `min_val` to infinity and `max_val` to negative infinity.
   - It then iterates over the array `a` to find the minimum and maximum values.
   - This step ensures that the program correctly identifies the smallest and largest numbers in the array, which are necessary to compute the maximum value of the expression.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Expression Value**:
   - After finding the minimum and maximum values, the program calculates the value of the expression \(4 \times (max_val - min_val)\).
   - Since the expression inside the absolute values in the original problem statement simplifies to considering the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array (due to the properties of absolute differences in a sorted sequence), this calculation is correct.

4. **Storing and Printing Results**:
   - The calculated value is stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, one per line, as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly processes the input, finds the minimum and maximum values, and calculates the desired expression value accurately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
