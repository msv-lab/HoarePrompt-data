The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. However, since `num` is currently `None`, updating `max_val` to `num` means `max_val` will also become `None`.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is `None`, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is `None`.**
