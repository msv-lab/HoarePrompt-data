The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` impacts the following variables:
- `a` is assigned a new value, which is the result of mapping the `int` function over the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n`.
- The slice `data[idx:idx + n]` refers to elements in `data` starting from index `10` (inclusive) to `10 + 30` (exclusive), which is just the element `'30'`.

Let's calculate the value of `a`:
- `data[10:13]` includes only the element `'30'`.
- Applying `map(int, ['30'])` converts `'30'` to `30`.

Therefore, `a` is now `[30]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is still `5`.
- `n` is still `30`.
- `data` remains `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`.
- `idx` is still `10`.
- `results` remains `[40, 108]`.
- `min_val` is still `3`.
- `max_val` is still `30`.
- `max_expression_value` is still `108`.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 10, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
