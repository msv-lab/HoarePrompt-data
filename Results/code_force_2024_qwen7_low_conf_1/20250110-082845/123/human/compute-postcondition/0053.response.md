Postcondition: ***After the first iteration, `a` will have one less element, `num` will be the next element in this updated list. If `num` is less than `min_val`, then `min_val` is updated to `num`. `max_val` and `max_expression_value` may have changed based on the value of `num`. Since there is no else part, the values of `max_val` and `max_expression_value` remain unchanged if `num` is not less than `min_val`.***
