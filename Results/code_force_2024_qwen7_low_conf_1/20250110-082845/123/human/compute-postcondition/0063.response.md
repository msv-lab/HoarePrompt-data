`idx` is incremented by `n`, which is 30. Initially, `idx` is 10. Therefore, `idx` will be 10 + 30 = 40.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
