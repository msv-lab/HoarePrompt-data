State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is 30**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Variable `num`**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Since `a` contains the single element `[30]`, the variable `num` will take the value `30` during the first (and only) iteration of the loop.

2. **Other Variables**: The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`) do not directly affect whether the loop will execute. They remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

### Conclusion:
The state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `num` is set to the only element in the list `a`, which is `30`.

State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is 30**
