According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`, which comes from the list `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Since `a` is defined as `[10, 20]`, the loop will iterate twice, once for `10` and once for `20`.

Before the loop starts, the following conditions must be met:
- The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to start.

Given that `a` is already defined as `[10, 20]`, it meets the requirement of having at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the state of `a` or its elements to ensure the loop can execute.

However, we should still include the initial states of other relevant variables for clarity.

State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is infinity, `max_val` is float('-inf')**
