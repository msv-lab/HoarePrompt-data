Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable `_` is used in the `range(t)`, meaning the loop will run `t` times.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs `t` times).

2. **Analyze the Given States:**
   - `t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`.
   - `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The values of `n`, `data`, `idx`, and `results` do not affect whether the loop executes; they remain unchanged until the loop body is executed.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
