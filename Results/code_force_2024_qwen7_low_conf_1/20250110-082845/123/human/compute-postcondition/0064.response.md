The code sets `min_val` to `float('inf')`. This means `min_val` is no longer the value `3` from the initial state but is now set to positive infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
