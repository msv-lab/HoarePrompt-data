The code snippet assigns the value of `num` to `max_val`. However, since `num` is not defined in the current scope, the assignment `max_val = num` will raise a NameError. Given the initial state, there is no `num` defined, so this assignment will fail.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], the code fails due to undefined variable `num`**
