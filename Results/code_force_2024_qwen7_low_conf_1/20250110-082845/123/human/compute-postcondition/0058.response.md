The code `results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_expression_value` is 108. Therefore, the updated `results` list will have the value 108 appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 9, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
