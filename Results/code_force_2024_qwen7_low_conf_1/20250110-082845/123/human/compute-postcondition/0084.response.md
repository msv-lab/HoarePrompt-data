The code updates `max_expression_value` to `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. Given that `max_val` is 30 and `min_val` is 30, the calculation becomes `4 * (30 - 30)`, which equals `4 * 0` or `0`.

Therefore, the variable `max_expression_value` changes from 108 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 0.**
