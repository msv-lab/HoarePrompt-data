The code assigns the value of `num` to `max_val`. Given that `num` is initially `None`, assigning `None` to `max_val` does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [], `min_val` is 20, `num` is None, `max_val` is None**
