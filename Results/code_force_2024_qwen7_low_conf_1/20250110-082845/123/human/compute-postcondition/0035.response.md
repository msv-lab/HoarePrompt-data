The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` impacts the program by converting a slice of the `data` list into a list of integers. Given the initial state, we need to extract the slice of `data` from index `idx` (which is 6) to `idx + n` (which is 12), and then convert each element in this slice to an integer.

However, since the slice `data[idx:idx + n]` starts at index 6 and goes up to 12 (exclusive), and the `data` list only contains 5 elements, the slice will be out of bounds. In Python, attempting to access an out-of-bounds index will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, no new list `a` will be created, and the existing state of the variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 6, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is `[]`, `min_val` is 10, `max_val` is 20, `max_expression_value` is 40**
