The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it seems to operate based on input that is not provided directly within the function definition but rather through external means (e.g., from stdin or a predefined list). The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and an array of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

For each test case, the function:
- Accepts an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 500`.
- For each of the `t` test cases, it accepts an integer `n` where `4 <= n <= 100`.
- It then accepts `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where `-10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6`.

Given the output descriptions are not provided, the function's return value is not specified. However, based on the input constraints and relationships, the functionality can be described as:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it processes the integers according to the given constraints.**
