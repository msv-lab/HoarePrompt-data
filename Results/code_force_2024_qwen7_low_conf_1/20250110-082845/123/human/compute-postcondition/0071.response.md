The code assigns the value of `num` to `max_val`. Since `num` is 30, `max_val` is updated to 30. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is 30**
