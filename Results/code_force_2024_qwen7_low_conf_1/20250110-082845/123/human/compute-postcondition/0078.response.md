According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop variable `num` takes on the value of each element in `a` one by one. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is 5
- `n` is 30
- `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
- `idx` is 40
- `results` is `[40, 108]`
- `a` is `[30]`
- `min_val` is 30
- `max_val` is 108
- `max_expression_value` is 108
- `num` is `None`

Since `a` only contains one element, which is `30`, and `num` is `None` at the end of the last iteration, it means that `num` did not get assigned a value from `a` yet. This implies that the loop has not executed even once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to take on the value of the first (and only) element in `a`, which is `30`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to execute) would be:

- `t` remains 5
- `n` remains 30
- `data` remains `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
- `idx` remains 40
- `results` remains `[40, 108]`
- `a` remains `[30]`
- `min_val` remains 30
- `max_val` remains 108
- `max_expression_value` remains 108
- `num` becomes `30`

State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 108, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is 30**
