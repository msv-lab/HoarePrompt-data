Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) and an array of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of the expression \( 4 \times (max(a) - min(a)) \), where \( max(a) \) and \( min(a) \) are the maximum and minimum values in the array \( a \), respectively. The function then prints the results for each test case, one per line.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input values for \( t \) and \( n \) are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500 and 4 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100). It does not handle cases where these values are outside these ranges.
- The function does not validate that the length of the data slice corresponding to each \( n \) matches the expected number of integers. If the input data is malformed (e.g., fewer integers than specified by \( n \)), the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.
- The function does not provide any output for invalid test cases. If the input data does not conform to the expected format, the function may behave unpredictably or crash.
- There is no explicit handling of negative indices or out-of-bounds errors when processing the input data. While the code currently handles these cases correctly due to the nature of the algorithm, it would be good practice to add error checking to ensure robustness.
