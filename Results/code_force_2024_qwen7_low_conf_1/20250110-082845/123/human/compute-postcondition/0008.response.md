The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` impacts the following:
- It creates a list `a` by converting each string in the slice of `data` starting from index `idx` (which is 2) up to `idx + n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`) into integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `idx` is 2.
- `results` is an empty list.

Let's assume the following example input for clarity:
- `data = ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`

Then:
- `t` is 5.
- `n` is 3 (since `data[1]` is '3').
- `idx` is 2.
- `data[idx:idx + n]` will be `data[2:4]`, which is `['10', '20']`.

The map function will convert these strings to integers, resulting in the list `[10, 20]`.

After executing the code:
- `a` will be the list `[10, 20]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20]**
