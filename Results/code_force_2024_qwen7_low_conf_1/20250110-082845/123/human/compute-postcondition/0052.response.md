`min_val` is assigned the value of `num`. The value of `num` becomes the current minimum value, which replaces the previous value of `min_val`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **After the first iteration, `a` will have one less element, `num` will be the next element in this updated list, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` and `max_expression_value` may have changed based on the value of `num`.**
