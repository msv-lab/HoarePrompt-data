The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial value of `idx` is 1, so after executing `idx += 1`, the value of `idx` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 2, and `results` is an empty list.**
