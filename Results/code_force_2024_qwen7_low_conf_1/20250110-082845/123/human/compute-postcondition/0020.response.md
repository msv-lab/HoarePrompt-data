`min_val` is assigned the value of `num`, which is 20. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is 20, `num` is 20.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is 20, `num` is 20**
