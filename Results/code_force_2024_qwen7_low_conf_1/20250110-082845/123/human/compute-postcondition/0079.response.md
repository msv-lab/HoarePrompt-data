The code `min_val = num` assigns the value of `num`, which is 30, to `min_val`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `t` is 5
- `n` is 30
- `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']
- `idx` is 40
- `results` is [40, 108]
- `a` is [30]
- `min_val` is now 30 (previously 30)
- `max_val` is 108
- `max_expression_value` is 108
- `num` is 30

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 108, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is 30**
