The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, and `idx`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
