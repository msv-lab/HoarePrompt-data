Let's break down the given information and the for loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is 4
- `n` is 3
- `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
- `idx` is 9
- `results` is `[40]`
- `a` is `[]`
- `min_val` is `float('inf')`
- `max_val` is `float('-inf')`
- `max_expression_value` is 40

### For Loop Statement:
```
for num in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The loop body is omitted, so we don't know what operations are performed inside the loop, but we know that the loop will only execute if `a` is non-empty.

2. **Checking the Current State of `a`**:
   - According to the given information, `a` is currently an empty list (`[]`).

3. **Determining the Adjustment Needed**:
   - Since `a` is empty, the loop will not execute because there are no elements to iterate over.
   - To make the loop execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Conclusion:
To adjust the state so that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the list `a` contains at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 40**

In this final state, the loop will be able to execute because `a` is no longer empty.
