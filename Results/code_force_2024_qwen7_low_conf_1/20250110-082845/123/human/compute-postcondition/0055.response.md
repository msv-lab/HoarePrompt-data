Postcondition: ***`a` will have one less element, `num` will be the next element in this updated list. `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than `min_val`. `max_val` is now `num` if `num` is greater than `max_val`, and `max_expression_value` remains unchanged if `num` is not less than `min_val`***
