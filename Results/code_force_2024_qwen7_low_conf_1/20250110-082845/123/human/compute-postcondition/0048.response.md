Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element), `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is the next `num` in `a`, `max_expression_value` is the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. If `num` is less than `min_val`, then `min_val` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
