`min_val` is reassigned the value of `float('inf')`, which means the minimum value is set to positive infinity. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is `[]`, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is 20, `max_expression_value` is 40.
