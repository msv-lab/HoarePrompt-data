Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `min_val` is a number less than or equal to `num`, `max_val` is `num`, `max_expression_value` is 40, `num` is a number that has been considered in the comparison and updated `min_val` if it is smaller than the current `min_val`.***

Explanation:
- The if part of the if-else block sets `max_val` to `num` if `num > max_val`. Given the initial conditions, `max_val` is initially set to `float('-inf')`, and since `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` will be updated to `num`.
- Since there is no else part, the only case to consider is when `num > max_val`, which results in updating `max_val` to `num`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `a`, `min_val`, `max_expression_value`, `num`) remain unchanged according to the problem statement.
