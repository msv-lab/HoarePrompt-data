The initial values are:
- `t` is 4
- `n` is 3
- `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
- `idx` is 9
- `results` is `[40]`
- `a` is an empty list
- `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `data`, which is 3
- `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `data`, which is 30
- `max_expression_value` is 40

The code snippet is:
```python
max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
- `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `data`, which is 30.
- `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `data`, which is 3.

The calculation is:
```python
max_expression_value = 4 * (30 - 3) = 4 * 27 = 108
```

So, `max_expression_value` is updated to 108.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 9, `results` is [40], `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
