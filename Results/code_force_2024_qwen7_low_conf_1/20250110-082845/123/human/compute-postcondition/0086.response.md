Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the index of the last processed string in `data`, `results` is a list containing the maximum expression values calculated for each iteration, `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, and `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val).**

Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of iterations the outer loop will run.
   - `n` is the size of the list `a` for each iteration.
   - `data` is a list of strings, and `idx` is the starting index for each list slice.
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results of each iteration.
   - `a` is an empty list for storing integers.
   - `min_val` and `max_val` are initialized to extreme values (`float('inf')` and `float('-inf')`) to ensure they are updated correctly during the inner loop.

2. **Outer Loop Execution**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[idx]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` is populated with integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`.
   - `idx` is incremented by `n`.
   - The inner loop updates `min_val` and `max_val` based on the values in `a`.
   - `max_expression_value` is calculated as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
   - `max_expression_value` is appended to `results`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations.
   - `n` will be the size of the last list `a` processed.
   - `data` remains unchanged as it is only read from.
   - `idx` will be the index of the last processed string in `data`.
   - `results` will contain the maximum expression values calculated for each iteration.
   - `a` will be an empty list since it is reinitialized for each iteration.
   - `min_val` and `max_val` will be the minimum and maximum values in `a` for the last iteration.
   - `max_expression_value` will be the result of the final calculation.

Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is that `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the index of the last processed string in `data`, `results` is a list containing the maximum expression values calculated for each iteration, `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, and `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val).
