According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `num` is 20, and the list `a` contains the elements [10, 20]. Since `num` is the last element in the list `a`, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in `a`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `t` remains 5.
- `n` remains 3.
- `data` remains ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'].
- `idx` remains 5.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `a` becomes an empty list since all elements have been iterated over.
- `min_val` remains 20.
- `num` becomes None, as there are no more elements in `a` to iterate over.

State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [], `min_val` is 20, `num` is None**
