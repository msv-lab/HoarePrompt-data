`idx` is incremented by 1. Initially, `idx` is 9, so after incrementing, `idx` becomes 10. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 10, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
