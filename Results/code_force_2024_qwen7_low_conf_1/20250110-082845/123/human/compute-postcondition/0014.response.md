The code `min_val = num` assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. Since the current value of `num` is less than infinity, `min_val` will now hold this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is the current value of `num`, `num` is less than infinity**
