Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `data`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `data`, `max_expression_value` is 40.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Since `a` starts as an empty list and is not modified within the loop, the loop body never executes, meaning no updates are made to `min_val`, `max_val`, or `num`.
- Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `a` remains an empty list.
- `min_val` and `max_val` will take the minimum and maximum values from the original list `data`, respectively.
- `max_expression_value` remains unchanged at 40 since the loop does not execute to update it.

Thus, the final state of the variables is determined by their initial values and the conditions under which the loop would execute, which in this case, do not occur.
