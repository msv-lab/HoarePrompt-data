The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. Given that `idx` is initially 1, this means `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
