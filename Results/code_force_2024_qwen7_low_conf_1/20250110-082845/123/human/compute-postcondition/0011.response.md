The code sets `max_val` to the lowest possible floating-point number, which is `float('-inf')`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is infinity, `max_val` is set to `float('-inf')**
