`min_val` is reassigned the value of `num`. The initial value of `num` is a number less than `min_val`, which is `float('inf')`. Therefore, `num` must be a finite number less than infinity. After the assignment, `min_val` will take on the value of `num`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `min_val` is `num`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 40, `num` is a number less than `min_val`**
