The code `results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_expression_value` is 0. The list `results` initially contains [40, 108]. After appending 0 to this list, the updated list will be [40, 108, 0].

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108, 0], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 0**
