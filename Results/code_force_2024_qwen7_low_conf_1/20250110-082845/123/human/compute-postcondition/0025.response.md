The code `min_val = num` assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. Since the initial value of `num` is `None`, `min_val` is now also `None`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [], `min_val` is `None`, `num` is `None`**
