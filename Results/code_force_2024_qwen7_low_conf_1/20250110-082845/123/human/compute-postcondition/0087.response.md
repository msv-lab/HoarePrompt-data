The code snippet `print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))` does not modify any of the existing variables. Instead, it prints the elements of the `results` list, each element converted to a string and separated by a newline. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `data`, `idx`, `results`, `a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, or `max_expression_value`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `data` is a list of strings, `idx` is the index of the last processed string in `data`, `results` is a list containing the maximum expression values calculated for each iteration, `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is the minimum value in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `a`, and `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val). The results list is printed with each element on a new line.**
