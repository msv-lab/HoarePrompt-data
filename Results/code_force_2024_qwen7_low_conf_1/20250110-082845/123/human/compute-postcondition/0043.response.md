Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `min_val` is a number less than or equal to `num`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 40, `num` is a number that has been considered in the comparison and updated `min_val` if it is smaller than the current `min_val`. The condition `num > max_val` is true.***
