The code sets `min_val` to the value of `num`. From the initial state, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list with one less element than `data`, and `idx` is 9, the last index in `data` which is 9, implies that `num` should be the last element in `data`, i.e., `num = 30`.

Therefore, `min_val` is updated to `30`.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element), `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is the next `num` in `a`, `max_expression_value` is the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**
