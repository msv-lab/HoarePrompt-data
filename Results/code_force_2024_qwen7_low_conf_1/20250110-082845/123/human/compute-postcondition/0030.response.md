The code `max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)` calculates the value of `max_expression_value` using the current values of `max_val` and `min_val`. Given the initial state, `max_val` is 20 and `min_val` is 10. Therefore, the calculation is `4 * (20 - 10)`, which equals `4 * 10 = 40`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [], `min_val` is 10, `max_val` is 20, `max_expression_value` is 40.**
