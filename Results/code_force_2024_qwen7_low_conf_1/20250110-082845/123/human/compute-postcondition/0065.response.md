The code sets `max_val` to `float('-inf')`. This changes the value of `max_val` from its previous value of 30 to `float('-inf')`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 108**
