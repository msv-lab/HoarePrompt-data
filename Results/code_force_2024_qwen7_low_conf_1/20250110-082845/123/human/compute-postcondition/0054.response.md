The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to be equal to `num`. According to the initial state, `num` is the next element in the updated list after the first iteration, and since there is no else part, the values of `max_val` and `max_expression_value` remain unchanged if `num` is not less than `min_val`. The value of `max_val` is now `num`, and the other conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`a` will have one less element, `num` will be the next element in this updated list, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than `min_val`, `max_val` is now `num`, `max_expression_value` remains unchanged if `num` is not less than `min_val`.**
