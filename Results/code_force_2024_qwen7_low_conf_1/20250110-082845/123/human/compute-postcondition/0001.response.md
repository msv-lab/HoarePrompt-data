`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `data` now holds the split input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
