The code assigns the first element of the list `data` to the variable `t`. Since `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `data` will be a string representing an integer. This integer is then converted to an integer type and assigned to `t`.

The states of `n` and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data` (a string), `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**
