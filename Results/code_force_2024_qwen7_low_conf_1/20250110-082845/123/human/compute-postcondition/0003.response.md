The code `idx = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `idx`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained from the first element of `data`, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1**
