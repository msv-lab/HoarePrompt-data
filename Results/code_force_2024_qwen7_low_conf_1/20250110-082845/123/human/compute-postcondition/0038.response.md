The code changes the value of `max_val` from 20 to `float('-inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is `[]`, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is 40**
