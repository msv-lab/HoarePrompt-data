The value of `idx` is incremented by `n`. Given the initial state, `idx` is 6 and `n` is 3. So, `idx` becomes 6 + 3 = 9.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is `[]`, `min_val` is 10, `max_val` is 20, `max_expression_value` is 40**
