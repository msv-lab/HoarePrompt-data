Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
   - `idx` is 9
   - `results` is `[40]`
   - `a` is a non-empty list
   - `min_val` is a number less than or equal to `num`
   - `max_val` is `num`
   - `max_expression_value` is 40
   - `num` is a number that has been considered in the comparison and updated `min_val` if it is smaller than the current `min_val`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **Current Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is a number from the list `a` that has been considered and possibly updated `min_val` and `max_expression_value`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list, the next element `num` will be the next item in the list.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `t` remains 4 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains 3 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `data` remains `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `idx` remains 9 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `results` remains `[40]` as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` now has one less element to process.
   - `min_val` will be updated if the next `num` in `a` is smaller than the current `min_val`.
   - `max_val` will be updated if the next `num` in `a` is larger than the current `max_val`.
   - `max_expression_value` will be updated based on the next `num` and its effect on the expression value.
   - `num` becomes the next element in the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element), `min_val` is a number less than or equal to the next `num` in `a`, `max_val` is the next `num` in `a`, `max_expression_value` is the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`**.
