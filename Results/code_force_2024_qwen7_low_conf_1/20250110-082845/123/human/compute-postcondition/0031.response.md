The code appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the `results` list. The initial value of `max_expression_value` is 40. After appending, the `results` list will contain `[40]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is [40], `a` is [], `min_val` is 10, `max_val` is 20, `max_expression_value` is 40**
