The given code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to read the entire input from stdin at once instead of reading it line by line. This does not change the values of the variables `t` and `n`, nor does it modify the list of integers `a`. However, it does change how the input is processed in subsequent code. Since no further operations are specified, the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; and the second line of each test case contains n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6. Input is read using `sys.stdin.read` instead of the default line-by-line input method.**
