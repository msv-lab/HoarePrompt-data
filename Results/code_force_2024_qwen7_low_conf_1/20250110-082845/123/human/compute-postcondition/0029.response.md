Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [], `min_val` is 10, `max_val` is 20.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `t` is 5
  - `n` is 3
  - `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
  - `idx` is 5
  - `results` is an empty list
  - `a` is `[10, 20]`
  - `min_val` is infinity
  - `max_val` is float('-inf')

- **Loop Code:**
  ```python
  for num in a:
      if num < min_val:
          min_val = num
      if num > max_val:
          max_val = num
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
  - Initially, `a` contains `[10, 20]`.
  - The loop updates `min_val` to be the smallest value in `a` and `max_val` to be the largest value in `a`.

- **First Iteration (num = 10):**
  - `min_val` is updated to 10 because 10 is less than infinity.
  - `max_val` remains float('-inf') because 10 is not greater than float('-inf').

- **Second Iteration (num = 20):**
  - `min_val` remains 10 because 20 is not less than 10.
  - `max_val` is updated to 20 because 20 is greater than float('-inf').

- **After Loop Execution:**
  - The loop completes its iteration over the elements in `a`.
  - `a` is emptied out (`[]`).
  - `min_val` is the smallest value encountered, which is 10.
  - `max_val` is the largest value encountered, which is 20.

Thus, after the loop executes, `a` is empty, `min_val` is 10, and `max_val` is 20. The other variables retain their initial values as no operations were performed on them within the loop.
