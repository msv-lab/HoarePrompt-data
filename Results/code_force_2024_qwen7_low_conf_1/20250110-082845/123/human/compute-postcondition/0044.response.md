The code snippet updates `max_val` to be equal to `num`. Given the initial conditions, `num` is a number that has been considered in the comparison and updated `min_val` if it is smaller than the current `min_val`, and the condition `num > max_val` is true. This means that before this line of code, `max_val` was set to `float('-inf')`, and `num` was greater than `max_val`.

After executing `max_val = num`, `max_val` will take the value of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `min_val` is a number less than or equal to `num`, `max_val` is `num`, `max_expression_value` is 40, `num` is a number that has been considered in the comparison and updated `min_val` if it is smaller than the current `min_val`.
