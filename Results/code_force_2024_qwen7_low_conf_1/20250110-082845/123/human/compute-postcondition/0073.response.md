According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and `a`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` is 5
- `n` is 30
- `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']
- `idx` is 40
- `results` is [40, 108]
- `a` is [30]
- `min_val` is 30
- `max_val` is 30
- `max_expression_value` is 108
- `num` is 30

The loop condition checks if `num` is greater than `max_val`. In this case, `num` is equal to `max_val`, so no changes are made to the variables inside the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Step-by-step adjustment:

1. The next element in the list `a` is `None` since the list `a` contains only one element, which is 30.
2. Therefore, the loop will not execute again because there are no more elements in `a`.

However, to strictly follow the format and ensure all states are considered:

State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is None**

This indicates that the loop will not execute again due to the absence of more elements in the list `a`.
