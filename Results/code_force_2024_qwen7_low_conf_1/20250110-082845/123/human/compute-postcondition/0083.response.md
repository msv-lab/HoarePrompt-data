Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is 5
   - `n` is 30
   - `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']
   - `idx` is 40
   - `results` is [40, 108]
   - `a` is [30]
   - `min_val` is `float('inf')`
   - `max_val` is `float('-inf')`
   - `max_expression_value` is 108

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `a`.
   - Initially, `a` contains only one element, which is 30.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - `num` is set to 30.
   - Since `30 < float('inf')`, `min_val` remains `float('inf')`.
   - Since `30 > -float('inf')`, `max_val` is updated to 30.
   - After the first iteration, `min_val` is 30, and `max_val` is 30.

4. **Second Iteration and Beyond**:
   - `a` does not change, so it still contains only the element 30.
   - The loop will not execute any further because `a` does not contain any additional elements.

5. **Final Values**:
   - Since the loop does not execute further iterations, `min_val` and `max_val` remain as they were after the first iteration.
   - `min_val` is 30.
   - `max_val` is 30.
   - `max_expression_value` remains 108 (as it was not affected by the loop).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables are as stated in the final output state.
