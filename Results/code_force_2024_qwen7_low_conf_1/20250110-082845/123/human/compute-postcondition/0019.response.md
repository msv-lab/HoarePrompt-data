Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is 5
   - `n` is 3
   - `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']
   - `idx` is 5
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `a` is [10, 20]
   - `min_val` is the minimum value from the list `a` (which is 10)

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The for loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - The loop condition is based on the variable `num`, which is each element of the list `a`.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - The initial state before any iterations (`num` not yet set).
   - After each iteration, `num` takes the value of the current element in the list `a`.

4. **Determine Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, which currently contains [10, 20]:
     - First iteration: `num` is 10
     - Second iteration: `num` is 20

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` contains only two elements [10, 20], the loop will stop after both elements are processed.

6. **Final State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute one more time with `num` being 20.
   - No other variables change within the loop body based on the provided information.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is 10, `num` is 20**
