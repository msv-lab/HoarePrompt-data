The code sets `max_val` to the value of `num`. Given that `num` is 20, `max_val` is assigned the value 20. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 3, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 5, `results` is an empty list, `a` is [10, 20], `min_val` is 20, `num` is 20, `max_val` is 20**
