Postcondition: ***`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 40, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is [30], `min_val` is 30, `max_val` is 108, `max_expression_value` is 108, `num` is `None`. If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
