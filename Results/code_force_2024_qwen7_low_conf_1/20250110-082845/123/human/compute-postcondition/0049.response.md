The code snippet `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. Since `num` is the next element in the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list with one less element than `data`, the next element in `a` would be `data[1]`, which is `'3'`. However, since `num` is compared with `min_val` to determine its new value, and `min_val` is initially `30`, `num` must be less than `30` for `min_val` to be updated. Given the initial state, `num` is `3`, which is less than `30`, so `min_val` will be updated to `3`.

Output State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element), `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 3, `max_expression_value` is the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**
