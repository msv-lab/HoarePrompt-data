Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element), `min_val` remains 3, `max_val` remains 3, `max_expression_value` remains the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. If `num` is greater than `max_val`, then `max_val` is updated to `num`; otherwise, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
