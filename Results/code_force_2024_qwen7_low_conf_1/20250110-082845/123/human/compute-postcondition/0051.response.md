Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is 4
   - `n` is 3
   - `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`
   - `idx` is 9
   - `results` is `[40]`
   - `a` is a non-empty list (with one less element)
   - `min_val` remains 3
   - `max_val` remains 3
   - `max_expression_value` remains the maximum of the current `max_expression_value` and the expression value based on the next `num`
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `a`.

3. **Key Variables:**
   - `num`: This is the current element being processed from the list `a`.
   - `min_val`: Minimum value found so far.
   - `max_val`: Maximum value found so far.
   - `max_expression_value`: Maximum value of an expression based on the elements in `a`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `a` is a non-empty list but has one less element, after processing the first element, it will have one less element remaining.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated. Otherwise, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `num` remain unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration States:**
   - `t` remains 4.
   - `n` remains 3.
   - `data` remains `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`.
   - `idx` remains 9.
   - `results` remains `[40]`.
   - `a` now has one less element than before.
   - `min_val` remains 3.
   - `max_val` may or may not have changed depending on the value of `num`.
   - `max_expression_value` may or may not have changed depending on the value of `num`.
   - `num` is now the next element in the updated list `a`.

6. **Final State:**
   After the first iteration, `a` will have one less element, and `num` will be the next element in this updated list. `min_val`, `max_val`, and `max_expression_value` may have changed based on the value of `num`.

State: **`t` is 4, `n` is 3, `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `idx` is 9, `results` is `[40]`, `a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `min_val` remains 3, `max_val` may be greater than 3 if `num` is greater than 3, `max_expression_value` may be updated, and `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**
