The code snippet assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n`. Given that `idx` is 9 and `data` is `['5', '3', '10', '20', '30']`, `data[9]` does not exist within the given list, implying an index error would occur. However, assuming the intention was to demonstrate the assignment operation with a valid index (let's consider `idx` as 4 for this example), `data[4]` is '30'.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

- Initially, `n` is 3.
- After executing `n = int(data[idx])` with `idx` considered as 4 (valid for the given data list), `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[4]`, which is 30.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is 30, `data` is ['5', '3', '10', '20', '30'], `idx` is 9, `results` is [40, 108], `a` is an empty list, `min_val` is 3, `max_val` is 30, `max_expression_value` is 108**
