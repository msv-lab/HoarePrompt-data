The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) and an array of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of the expression \( 4 \times (max(a) - min(a)) \), where \( max(a) \) and \( min(a) \) are the maximum and minimum values in the array \( a \), respectively. The function then prints the results for each test case, one per line.
