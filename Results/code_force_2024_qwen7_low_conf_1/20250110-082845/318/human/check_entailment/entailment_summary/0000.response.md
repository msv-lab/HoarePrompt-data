Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: 
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)), does \( p_i \) divide \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divide \( p_{j+1} \).
   
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through \( t \) test cases.
   - For each test case, it constructs a list `a` with \( n \) elements.
   - The first half of the list contains integers from 1 to \( n // 2 \).
   - The second half of the list contains integers from \( n // 2 + 1 \) to \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the last element is set to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Permutation Validity**:
   - Let's consider the constructed list `a`.
   - For even \( n \), the list is `[1, 2, ..., n//2, n//2+1, ..., n]`.
   - For odd \( n \), the list is `[1, 2, ..., n//2, n//2+1, ..., n, n]`.
   - Notice that no two consecutive numbers in this list will have a divisibility relationship because they are either separated by \( n//2 \) (if \( n \) is even) or by \( n//2 \) plus an additional 1 (if \( n \) is odd).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The construction ensures that no element in the first half can divide any element in the second half due to the gap introduced by \( n//2 \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the last element is just \( n \), which does not affect the divisibility condition with respect to the rest of the list.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly constructs a valid permutation for any \( n \) within the specified constraints.
   - The logic ensures that no two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) satisfy the divisibility condition.

Correctness: **True**
