You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        mid = n // 2
        a = []
        for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
            a.append(i)
            a.append(mid + i)
        if n % 2 != 0:
            a.append(n)
        for i in range(n):
            print(a[i], end=' ')
        print('\n', end='')

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), each `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements where the first half consists of integers from 1 to \(n // 2\) and the second half consists of those integers incremented by \(n // 2\), if `n` is odd, the last element is `n`, and the list `a` contains all these values exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each \( n \), the function generates and prints a sequence of integers. Specifically, it creates a list `a` containing \( n \) elements, where the first half of the list consists of integers from 1 to \( n // 2 \), and the second half consists of those integers incremented by \( n // 2 \). If \( n \) is odd, the last element of the list is set to \( n \). After constructing the list, the function prints its elements, one per line. The function handles up to \( 10^3 \) test cases, and the sum of all \( n \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 10^5 \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step-by-step in relation to the problem statement:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, which is the length of the required permutation.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program creates a list `a` and populates it with values from `1` to `mid` (where `mid = n // 2`) followed by `mid + 1` to `n`.
   - This ensures that the constructed list has elements interleaved in a way that no element `p_i` (for `i < n-1`) divides `p_{i+1}` because they alternate between numbers from the first half and the second half of the sequence.
   - If `n` is odd, the largest number `n` is appended to the list `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that the permutation is printed in the required format.

Let's consider some examples to confirm the logic:

- For `n = 4`, the program constructs `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. Here, no pair `(p_i, p_{i+1})` exists where both divide each other.
- For `n = 3`, the program constructs `[1, 2, 3]`. All permutations of length 3 are valid, and this one works.

Given the constraints and the construction method, the program should always produce a valid permutation that meets the criteria specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
