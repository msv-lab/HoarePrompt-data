### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program creates a list `a` and populates it with values from `1` to `mid` (where `mid = n // 2`) followed by `mid + 1` to `n`. 
   - This ensures that the constructed list alternates between numbers from the first half and the second half of the sequence, which is a valid approach to avoid any `p_i` dividing `p_{i+1}`. However, we need to check if this construction guarantees that no `p_i` divides `p_{i+1}` for all possible values of `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of the list `a` for each test case, ensuring that the permutation is printed in the required format. This part is also correct.

Let's analyze the construction method in detail:

- For `n = 4`, the constructed list is `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. Here, no pair `(p_i, p_{i+1})` exists where both divide each other.
- For `n = 3`, the constructed list is `[1, 2, 3]`. While this is a valid permutation, the program's approach might not generalize well for all `n`.

However, the problem specifies that at least one permutation exists for any `n` in the given range. The construction method ensures that the elements are interleaved in a way that no element in the first half can divide any element in the second half, but it does not guarantee that no `p_i` will divide `p_{i+1}` within the same half.

Consider the case when `n` is even:
- For `n = 6`, the constructed list is `[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]`. Here, `p_2 = 4` divides `p_4 = 5`, which violates the condition.

Thus, the program does not guarantee that no `p_i` will divide `p_{i+1}` for all possible `n`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not guarantee the construction of a valid permutation for all `n` as per the problem constraints.

**Final: False**
