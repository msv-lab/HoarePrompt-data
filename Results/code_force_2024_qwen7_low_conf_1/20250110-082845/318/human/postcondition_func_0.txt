The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each \( n \), the function generates and prints a sequence of integers. Specifically, it creates a list `a` containing \( n \) elements, where the first half of the list consists of integers from 1 to \( n // 2 \), and the second half consists of those integers incremented by \( n // 2 \). If \( n \) is odd, the last element of the list is set to \( n \). After constructing the list, the function prints its elements, one per line. The function handles up to \( 10^3 \) test cases, and the sum of all \( n \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 10^5 \).
