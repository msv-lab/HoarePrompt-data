The initial state provides several variables with specific ranges and values. The line of code `a = []` initializes an empty list for `a`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or `mid`. Therefore, the only change is that `a` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is \(n + 1\); `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2; `a` is an empty list.**
