The code snippet prints the element in the list `a` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 2 and `a` is a list containing elements from `n // 2` to `n // 2 + n`, the value at index `i` (which is 2) would be `n // 2 + 2 - 1` because list indices start at 0.

Let's denote `n // 2` as `mid`, which means `mid = n // 2`. So, the value at index `i` (2) is `mid + 1`.

Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the value at index `i` is `n // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the output of `print(a[i], end=' ')` is the value `n // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\), the print statement outputs `n // 2 + 1`**.
