State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `_` is now 1**

### Explanation:
1. **`t`**: The variable `t` represents the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 and no more than \(10^3\). Since the loop runs based on the value of `t`, `t` must be greater than 0.
   
2. **`n` for each test case**: Inside the loop, `n` is defined as the number of iterations for each test case. For each test case, `n` must be at least 3 and no more than \(10^5\). The specific values of `n` within each test case do not need to be explicitly stated here because the loop will initialize `n` appropriately for each test case.

3. **Sum of all `n` across all test cases**: The problem statement mentions that the sum of all `n` across all test cases should not exceed \(10^5\). This constraint ensures that the loop will not run indefinitely or cause excessive memory usage.

4. **`_`**: The underscore `_` is typically used as a variable name when the actual value is not important. In the context of the loop, `_` is simply an iterator that will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `_` needs to be initialized to 0 (or 1 depending on the convention used).

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are that `t` must be greater than 0, and the loop will handle the initialization of `n` for each test case appropriately.
