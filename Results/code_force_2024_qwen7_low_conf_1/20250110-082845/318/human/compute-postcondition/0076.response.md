Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), each `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is `n + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements where the first half consists of integers from 1 to \(n // 2\) and the second half consists of those integers incremented by \(n // 2\), if `n` is odd, the last element is `n`, and the list `a` contains all these values exactly once.**
