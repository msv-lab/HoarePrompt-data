Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is \(n // 2\).
   - `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).
   - The first element of `a` is printed.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(n)`. 

3. **Current State at the Start of the Loop:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop range.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` remains within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `mid` remains \(n // 2\).
   - `a` remains a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).**
