The code initializes an empty list `a`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, or `mid`. Therefore, the only change is that `a` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is an empty list**
