According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `a` is `[2, mid + 2]`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1`
- Since `i` is currently 2, it means `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 2.

Let's assume `n // 2 + 1` is 3 (the smallest value greater than 2), then:
- `i` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will be 3
- `n // 2 + 1` must be greater than 2

State: **`i` is 3, `a` is [2, mid + 2]**
