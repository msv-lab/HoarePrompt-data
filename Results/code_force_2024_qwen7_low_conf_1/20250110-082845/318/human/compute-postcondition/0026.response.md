Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `mid` is \(n // 2\).
   - `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).
   - All elements of `a` from index 0 to \(n - 1\) are printed, and a newline is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates `t` times.
   - `_` is a dummy variable used to indicate that we don't care about the index value within the loop (it could be any integer from 0 to \(t-1\)).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented by 1.
   - All other states (`n`, `i`, `mid`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **New States:**
   - `t` becomes \(t + 1\).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\)**.
