`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3 and `a` is `[2, mid + 2, 3]`, the value of `mid + i` is `mid + 3`. This new value is appended to the list `a`.

Therefore, the updated list `a` becomes `[2, mid + 2, 3, mid + 3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` is [2, mid + 2, 3, mid + 3]**
