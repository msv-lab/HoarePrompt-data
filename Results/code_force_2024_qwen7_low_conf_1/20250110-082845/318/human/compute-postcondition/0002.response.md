The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input for `n` does not affect `t`. The variable `_` is set to 1 initially and is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `_` is 1**
