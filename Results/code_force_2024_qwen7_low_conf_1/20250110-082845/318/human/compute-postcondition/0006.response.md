The code `a.append(i)` appends the variable `i` to the list `a`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `i` is not initialized, appending `i` to the list `a` will raise an error in a real execution environment. But for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume `i` is a placeholder and does not exist in the current context, which means the list `a` remains unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `_` is 1
- `mid` is \(n // 2\)
- `a` is an empty list

Since `i` is not defined, appending `i` to `a` does not change `a`, and all other variables remain as they are.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is an empty list**
