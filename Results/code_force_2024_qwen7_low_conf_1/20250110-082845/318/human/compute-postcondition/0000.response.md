`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `t` and keeps the initial condition for `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
