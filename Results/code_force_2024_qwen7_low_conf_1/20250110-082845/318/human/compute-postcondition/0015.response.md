Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n\) elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `n-1`. The current value of `n` is odd.**
