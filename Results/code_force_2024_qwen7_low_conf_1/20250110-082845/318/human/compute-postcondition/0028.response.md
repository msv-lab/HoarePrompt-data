The code `mid = n // 2` updates the variable `mid` to be the integer division of `n` by 2. The previous value of `mid` was \(n // 2\), but now it is explicitly assigned to be the result of this operation.

Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is \(n + 1\); `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2; `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).**
