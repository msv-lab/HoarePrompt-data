The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might internally handle variables `t` and `n` where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we will focus on the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but handles variables `t` and `n` where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).**
