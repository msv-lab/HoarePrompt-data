The code `print('\n', end='')` does not affect the values of any variables. It only adds a newline character to the output, which does not change the state of the variables. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing pairs of integers from 1 to `n // 2` and their corresponding values `mid + i`, if `n` is odd, the pair `(n, mid + n)` is added to the list `a`, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the loop prints each pair in the list `a` exactly once.**
