The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. From the initial state, `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\). 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\),
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `_` is 1,
- `mid` is \(n // 2\),
- `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`,
- `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\).

After appending `i` to `a`, the list `a` will have one more element than before. The new element added is \((n // 2) + 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\),
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `_` is 1,
- `mid` is \(n // 2\),
- `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`, and an additional element \((n // 2) + 1\),
- `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`, and an additional element \((n // 2) + 1\), `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\)**.
