The code divides `n` by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means it assigns the quotient of `n` divided by 2 to the variable `mid`. The value of `n` is between 3 and \(10^5\), so the value of `mid` will be `n // 2`, which is the integer division result. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `_` is 1

After the code is executed, the value of `_` remains 1, and `mid` is set to `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\)**
