According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold true:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `i` is 2
- `mid` is \(n // 2\)
- `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\)
- The print statement outputs `n // 2 + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented and should still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented to 3. For the loop to continue, `i` must remain less than `n`.

Thus, the new state will be:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `i` is 3
- `mid` remains \(n // 2\)
- `a` remains a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\)

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 3, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\)**
