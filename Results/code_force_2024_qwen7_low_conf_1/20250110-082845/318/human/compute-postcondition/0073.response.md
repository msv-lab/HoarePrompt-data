`i` is currently 3, and `a[2]` is (3, 7). The code `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the tuple `a[i]` which is `a[3]`. However, since `a[3]` is not defined in the initial state, and no new value for `a[3]` is assigned, the code will attempt to print the tuple `a[3]` which is undefined. 

Output State: **`total` remains 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a[2]` is (3, 7), and the output is an error or undefined behavior since `a[3]` is not defined.**
