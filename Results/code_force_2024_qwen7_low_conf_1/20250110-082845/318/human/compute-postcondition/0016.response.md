The code appends the value of `n` to the list `a`. Given that `n` is odd and the current value of `n` is odd, appending `n` to the list `a` means adding an additional element to the list, making the total number of elements in `a` now `n + 1`.

The initial conditions specify that `a` originally contains `n` elements, each being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `n-1`. After appending `n`, the new last element of the list `a` will be `n`.

Therefore, the updated list `a` will contain elements from `n // 2` to `n // 2 + n - 1`, plus the additional element `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\), and the last element is `n`.**
