The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is inputted, while the other variables (`t`, `i`, `mid`, and `a`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions for these variables are:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is \(n + 1\).
- `mid` is \(n // 2\).
- `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).

After executing the code, the new value of `n` will be the integer input, and the other variables will retain their original relationships. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), updated to the input value; `i` is \(n + 1\); `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\).**
