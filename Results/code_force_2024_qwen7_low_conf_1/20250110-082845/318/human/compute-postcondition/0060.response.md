The code `a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `a` is `[2]`, and assuming `mid` is an existing variable with a specific value, the code will add `mid + 2` to the list `a`. However, since the value of `mid` is not provided, we'll denote it as a placeholder for now.

After executing the code, the list `a` will have its original element plus the new element `mid + 2`. Therefore, the updated list `a` will be `[2, mid + 2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is [2, mid + 2]**
