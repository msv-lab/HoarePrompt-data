To ensure the loop executes, we need to analyze the conditions required for the loop to start:

1. The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
2. The initial value of `i` is set to 1 (`_` is 1).

Given these points, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, but since the problem states that `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), this condition is already satisfied.

The key state adjustments needed are:

- The initial value of `i` should be 0 (since the loop starts from 0).
- The variable `n` must be at least 1, but given the constraint \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), this is already covered.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is 0; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\). If `n` is odd, the last element of `a` is `n`; otherwise, the last element of `a` remains \(n // 2 + n - 1\).**
