Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is initialized to \(n + 1\).
   - `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `a` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n // 2 + 1\).
   - Inside the loop, `a.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `a`.
   - `a.append(mid + i)` adds the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `n // 2 + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n // 2 + 1`.
   - The list `a` will contain all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`. This means `a` will have exactly `2 * (n // 2 + 1)` elements.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must be within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `mid` remains the integer division of `n` by 2, as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `total` is not directly modified in the loop and is given as 10, which seems to be a constant value and not dependent on the loop itself.

Thus, the final output state of the loop after all iterations is as described above.
