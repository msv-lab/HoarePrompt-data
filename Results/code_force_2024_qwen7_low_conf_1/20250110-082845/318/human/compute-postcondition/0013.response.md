The code snippet appends the value `mid + i` to the list `a`. Let's break down the initial state and the impact of the code:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `_` is 1.
- `mid` is \(n // 2\).
- `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements: each element is `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, and an additional element \((n // 2) + 1\).
- `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\).

Given these details, let's calculate the new value of `a` after appending `mid + i`:

- Initially, `a` is defined as follows:
  - For \(i\) in range `0` to `t`: `a[i] = (n // 2) + i`.
  - An additional element: `a[t] = (n // 2) + 1`.

- After the code snippet `a.append(mid + i)`, we append the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. 

Since `mid = n // 2` and `i = (n // 2) + 1`, the value to be appended is:
\[ mid + i = (n // 2) + ((n // 2) + 1) = n // 2 + n // 2 + 1 = n + 1 \]

So, the updated list `a` will now include the value `n + 1` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements: each element is `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, and an additional element \((n // 2) + 1\), and `a` now includes the element `n + 1`, `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\)**.
