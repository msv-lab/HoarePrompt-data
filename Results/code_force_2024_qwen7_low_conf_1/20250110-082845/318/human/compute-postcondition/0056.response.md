`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending `i`, `a` will contain `[i]`. The value of `i` is `n`, and since `n` must be at least 2, `i` must also be at least 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[i]`, `t` must be greater than 0**
