The code snippet `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.

The list `a` starts from `n // 2` to `n // 2 + n`, and since `i` is 0, `a[i]` will be `n // 2`.

The output of `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `i` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\); the first element of `a` is printed.**
