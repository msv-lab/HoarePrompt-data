`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Since `mid` is initially `n // 2`, the value added to the list `a` will be `n // 2 + i`, where `i` starts from 0. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < t - 1`, so the list `a` will contain `t` elements, each being `n // 2 + i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` remains an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `_` remains 1
- `mid` remains \(n // 2\)
- `a` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`.**
