Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `total` is 10
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` must be a positive integer
  - `mid` is `n // 2`
  - `a` is a list containing pairs of integers from 1 to `n // 2` and their corresponding values `mid + i`
  - if `n` is odd, the pair `(n, mid + n)` is added to the list `a`
  - the value of `t` remains greater than 0
  - the print statement outputs `a[i]`

- The code is: `print(a[i], end=' ')`

- First, let's determine the value of `mid` which is `n // 2`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `mid` will be `n // 2`.

- Next, the list `a` is constructed as follows:
  - Pairs of integers from 1 to `n // 2` and their corresponding values `mid + i` (where `i` is 2) are added to `a`.
  - If `n` is odd, the pair `(n, mid + n)` is also added to `a`.

- Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` would be the third element in the list `a`.

- However, we are asked to find `a[i]` which is `a[2]`. Let's construct `a` assuming `n` is a general positive integer and then determine `a[2]`.

- If `n` is even, say `n = 6`, then:
  - `mid = 3`
  - `a` would be: `[(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7)]`

- If `n` is odd, say `n = 7`, then:
  - `mid = 3`
  - `a` would be: `[(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (7, 8)]`

- In both cases, `a[2]` will be the third element, which is `(3, 7)` if `n` is even and `(3, 7)` if `n` is odd.

- Therefore, `a[2]` is `(3, 7)` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd.

- The print statement outputs `a[2]` which is `(3, 7)`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing pairs of integers from 1 to `n // 2` and their corresponding values `mid + i`, if `n` is odd, the pair `(n, mid + n)` is added to the list `a`, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, `a[2]` is (3, 7)**
