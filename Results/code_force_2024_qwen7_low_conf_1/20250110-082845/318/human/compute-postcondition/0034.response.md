The list `a` is appended with the value of `i`. Initially, `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, appending `i` to `a` results in `a` becoming `[1, n // 2 + 1, 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 10, `i` is 2, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 2]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 2]`**
