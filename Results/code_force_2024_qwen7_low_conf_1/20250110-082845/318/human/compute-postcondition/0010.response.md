The code `a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n // 2`, and `mid` is `n // 2`. So, `mid + i` is `n // 2 + (n // 2) = n`.

The list `a` initially contained `t` elements, each being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`. After appending `n` to `a`, the list `a` now has `t + 1` elements. The updated list `a` is `[n // 2, n // 2 + 1, ..., n // 2 + (t - 1), n]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`; `i` is `n // 2`**  
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`; `i` is `n // 2`**
