The code snippet `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `a` is a list containing exactly `n + 1` elements, starting from `n // 2` to `n // 2 + n`.

Since `i` is 3, we need to determine the value of `a[3]`. The list `a` starts from `n // 2` and contains `n + 1` elements. Therefore, the elements of `a` are `[n // 2, n // 2 + 1, n // 2 + 2, ..., n // 2 + n]`.

To find the value of `a[3]`, we need to calculate the position in the list:
- The first element of `a` is `n // 2`.
- The second element of `a` is `n // 2 + 1`.
- The third element of `a` is `n // 2 + 2`.
- The fourth element of `a` is `n // 2 + 3`.

Thus, `a[3]` is `n // 2 + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `i` is 3, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\); the output is `n // 2 + 3`**
