Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, and if `n` is odd, then `n` is appended to the list `a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Initial Values:**
   - `total` starts at 10.
   - `i` starts at `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `n` is appended to the list `a`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, since the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop prints each element of the list `a` in sequence.
   - Since the loop iterates `n` times, it will print all elements of `a`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be `n` (the final value of `i` after the loop completes).

4. **Variable Values Post-Loop:**
   - `total` remains 10 because the loop does not modify it.
   - `i` becomes `n` after the loop.
   - `n` and `mid` retain their original values.
   - `a` remains unchanged after the loop.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as stated above.
