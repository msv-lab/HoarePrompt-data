According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `total` is 10
- `i` is 2
- `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `mid` is \(n // 2\)
- `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 2, (n // 2) + 2]`

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `1 <= i < n // 2 + 1` must be satisfied. Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop can only execute again if `i` becomes 3.

So, we need to update `i` to 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing. The values of `mid`, `a`, and `total` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 2, (n // 2) + 2]`**
