Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n + 1\) elements, starting from \(n // 2\) to \(n // 2 + n\). If `n` is odd, the last element of `a` is `n`; otherwise, the last element of `a` remains \(n // 2 + n - 1\).***
