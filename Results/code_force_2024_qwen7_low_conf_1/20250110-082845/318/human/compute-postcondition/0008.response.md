Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the loop, we still include it as per the given state).
   - `mid` is \(n // 2\).
   - `a` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as: `for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):`
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n // 2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the new state for the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be one less than its value at the start of the current iteration. Since the loop starts from 1, if the loop just finished, `i` would be equal to `n // 2` (because the loop increments `i` up to `n // 2`).

5. **New States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `t`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `n`.
   - `_` remains 1 since the loop does not affect this variable.
   - `mid` remains \(n // 2\) since the loop does not affect `mid`.
   - `a` remains unchanged since the loop does not affect `a`.

6. **Loop Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`; `i` is \(n // 2\)**.
