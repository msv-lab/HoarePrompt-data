The code snippet `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to 2, and `a` is an empty list. After appending `i` to `a`, `a` will contain the value `2`.

Since the loop condition `n + 1 <= n // 2 + 1` holds true for `n = 2`, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the loop can continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is [2]**
