`a.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `a`. Given the initial state, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and is odd, and `a` initially contains all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`.

Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` is an integer, and appending `n` to `a` means adding `n` to the end of the list. The updated list `a` will contain all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers each incremented by `n // 2`, and then finally `n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is `n // 2 + 1`
- `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and is odd
- `mid` is \(n // 2\)
- `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, and then `n`

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and is odd, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, and then `n`**
