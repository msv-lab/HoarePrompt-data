To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and requirements step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - This means `i` must be within the range `[1, n // 2 + 1]`.

2. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t + 1 \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `i` is initially set to \(n + 1\).
   - `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2, i.e., `mid = n // 2`.
   - `a` is an empty list.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` (which is initially \(n + 1\)) needs to fall within the range `[1, n // 2 + 1]`.
   - Given `i = n + 1`, we need to check if \(n + 1\) can be within `[1, n // 2 + 1]`. Since \(n \geq 3\), \(n + 1 > n // 2 + 1\) always holds true. Therefore, `i` as \(n + 1\) is never within the required range.
   - To make the loop executable, we need to adjust `i` to be within `[1, n // 2 + 1]`.

Based on these points, we need to adjust `i` to a value within the required range. Let's assume the smallest possible value for `i` which is `1` (since the loop starts from `1`).

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to `1` while ensuring `n` remains valid within its range.

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is an empty list**.

The key here is to adjust `i` to be `1` to satisfy the loop condition.
