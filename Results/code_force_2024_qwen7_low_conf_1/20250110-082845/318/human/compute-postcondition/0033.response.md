According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop runs from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), and `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value within its range. Since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n // 2 + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` remains within its original range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\) and that `mid` and `a` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop itself.

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1]`**
