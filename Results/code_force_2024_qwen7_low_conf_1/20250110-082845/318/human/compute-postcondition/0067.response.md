Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing pairs of integers from 1 to `n // 2` and their corresponding values `mid + i`. If `n` is odd, the pair `(n, mid + n)` is added to the list `a`. The value of `t` remains greater than 0.***
