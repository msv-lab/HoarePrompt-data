Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing exactly \(n\) elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.
- Each iteration appends two elements to the list `a`: `i` and `mid + i`.
- Since `mid = n // 2`, the elements appended are `i` and `n // 2 + i`.

After the loop completes:
- The loop will append elements until it reaches `n // 2 + 1`.
- For each `i` in the range `1` to `n // 2 + 1`, two elements are added to `a`.
- This means `a` will have exactly `2 * (n // 2 + 1)` elements, but since we start from `1`, it effectively has `n` elements.

Thus, the final state of `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is `n // 2 + i` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.
