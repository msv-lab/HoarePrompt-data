The list `a` is updated by appending `mid + i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, so `mid` is `n // 2`. Therefore, `a.append(mid + i)` means `a` will append the value `n // 2 + n` to itself. The value of `total`, `i`, `mid`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[i, n // 2 + n]`, `t` must be greater than 0**
