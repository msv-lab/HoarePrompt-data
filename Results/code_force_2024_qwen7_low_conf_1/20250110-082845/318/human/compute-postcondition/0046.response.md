The code `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` in the list `a` without a newline. The value of `i` is 1, so it will print the second element in the list `a`. The list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]`, so the second element is `2`. The output of the print statement will be `2`, but since we are using `end=' '`, it will be printed with a space at the end. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mid` is 2, `a` is [1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8], and the output is `2 `**
