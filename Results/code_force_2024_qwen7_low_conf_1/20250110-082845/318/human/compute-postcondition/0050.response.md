The code `print('\n', end='')` does not affect any variables. It only prints a newline character. The state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, and if `n` is odd, then `n` is appended to the list `a`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `n`.**
