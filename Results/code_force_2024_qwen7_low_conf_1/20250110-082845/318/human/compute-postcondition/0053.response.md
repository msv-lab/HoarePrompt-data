The code `mid = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `mid`. Since `n` is an input integer, the value of `mid` is `n // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, if `n` is odd, then `n` is appended to the list `a`, and `t` must be greater than 0.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` followed by the same integers incremented by `n // 2`, if `n` is odd, then `n` is appended to the list `a`, and `t` must be greater than 0**
