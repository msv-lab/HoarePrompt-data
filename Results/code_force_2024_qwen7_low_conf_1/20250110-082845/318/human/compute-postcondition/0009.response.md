The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Initially, `i` is equal to `n // 2`. We know that `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), so `i` is also an integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq 50000\). The list `a` initially contains `t` elements, each being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t - 1`. After appending `i` to `a`, the list `a` now has `t + 1` elements.

Given that `a` initially was defined as `[n // 2, n // 2 + 1, ..., n // 2 + (t - 1)]`, after appending `i`, the new list `a` will be `[n // 2, n // 2 + 1, ..., n // 2 + (t - 1), n // 2]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `_` is 1; `mid` is \(n // 2\); `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`; `i` is `n // 2`**
