Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `_` is 1 (This variable seems unused, so we don't need to consider it)
- `mid` is \(n // 2\)
- `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`
- `i` is `n // 2`

### For Loop:
The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, n // 2 + 1)`.
2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `n // 2`
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become `(n // 2) + 1`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `t` remains unchanged as the value of `t` does not affect the loop condition.
- `n` remains unchanged as the value of `n` does not affect the loop condition.
- `_` remains unchanged as it was initially 1 and seems unused.
- `mid` remains unchanged as `mid` is already set to `n // 2`.
- `a` remains unchanged as the list `a` is pre-defined and its contents do not change within the loop.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `(n // 2) + 1`.

### Final State at the Start of Next Iteration:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is a list containing `t + 1` elements, each element being `n // 2 + i` for `i` in range `0` to `t`, with the last element being `n`, `i` is \((n // 2) + 1\)**
