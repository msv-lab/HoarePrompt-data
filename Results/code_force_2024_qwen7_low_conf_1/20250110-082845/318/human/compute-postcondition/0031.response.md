`a` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `a` becomes `[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1]`**
