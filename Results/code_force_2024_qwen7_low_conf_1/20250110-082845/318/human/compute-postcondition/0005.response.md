Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time until it reaches `n // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `_` (underscore) is `1`.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`, meaning `mid` is an integer that represents half of `n` rounded down.
   - `a` is an empty list.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= i <= n // 2 + 1` must be true when the loop starts.
   - Specifically, `i` starts at `1`, and as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n // 2 + 1`, the loop will continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is `1`, so we need to ensure that `n // 2 + 1` is a positive number.
   - Given the constraints, `n` is at least `3`, so `n // 2` will be at least `1`, and thus `n // 2 + 1` will be at least `2`. This means the loop will always execute at least once.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - Since the loop will always execute at least once given the constraints on `n`, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring `n` is within its specified range.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `_` is 1, `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is an empty list**
