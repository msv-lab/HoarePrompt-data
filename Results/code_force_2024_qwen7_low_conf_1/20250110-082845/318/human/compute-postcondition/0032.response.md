The code appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is 1. So, the new element added to `a` is `n // 2 + 1`.

Since `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the value of `mid + i` (which is `n // 2 + 1`) will be a specific integer. The initial state of `a` is `[1]`, so after appending, `a` will become `[1, n // 2 + 1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is within the range \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `mid` is \(n // 2\), `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1]`**
