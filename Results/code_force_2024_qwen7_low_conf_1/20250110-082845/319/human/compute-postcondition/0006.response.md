The code `f_a = func_2(a)` assigns the return value of `func_2(a)` to `f_a`. However, since `func_2` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine its exact behavior. The only information we know is that `a` is a list containing `[v]`, where `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`
- `a` is a list containing `[v]`

After executing the code, `f_a` will hold the return value from `func_2(a)`, and `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`, `a` is `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`**
