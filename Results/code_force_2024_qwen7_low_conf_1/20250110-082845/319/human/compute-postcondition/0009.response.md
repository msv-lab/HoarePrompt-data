According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`, `a` is `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, `last` is `f_a`, and `results` contains `f_a`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `q` must still be greater than 0.
- `v` remains the same as it is calculated only once at the start of the loop.
- `a` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
- `f_a` remains the same since it is calculated only once at the start of the loop.
- `last` remains the same since it is calculated only once at the start of the loop.
- `results` contains `f_a` and will include the new value of `f_a` if the loop executes again.

State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`, `a` is `[v]`, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, `last` is `f_a`, `results` contains `f_a`**
