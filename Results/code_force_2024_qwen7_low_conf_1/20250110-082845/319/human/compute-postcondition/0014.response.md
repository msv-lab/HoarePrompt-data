The code appends `f_a` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, and this value is now added to the list `results`.

- `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is 1.
- `q` remains unchanged, so `q` must be greater than 0.
- `v` remains unchanged, so `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`.
- `a` remains unchanged, so `a` is `[v, v]`.
- `f_a` remains unchanged, so `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`.
- `last` remains unchanged, so `last` is equal to `f_a`.
- `results` now includes the new value `f_a`, which was the return value of `func_2(a)`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`; `a` is `[v, v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `last` is equal to `f_a`; `results` contains `[f_a]`**
