`results.append(f_a)` appends the value of `f_a` to the list `results`. Since `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, and `a` is defined as `[v]`, the value of `results` now includes `f_a`. The value of `i`, `q`, `v`, `a`, and `last` remains unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`; `a` is `[v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`; `last` is `f_a`; `results` contains `f_a`**
