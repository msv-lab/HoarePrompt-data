Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. It processes `q` encrypted values using a rolling computation and a helper function `func_2`. Specifically, it iterates over each of the `q` encrypted values, computes the current value `v` as the sum of the current encrypted value and the last computed value modulo `n`, appends `v` to a list `a`, and then calls `func_2` with the updated list `a`. The result of `func_2` is stored in `last` and added to the `results` list. After completing the loop, the function returns the `results` list, which contains `q` elements, each being the output of `func_2` after processing each encrypted value. This process ensures that each element in `results` reflects the cumulative effect of the computations performed on the corresponding encrypted values.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `q` is 0, the function still initializes `results` as an empty list and returns it, which is consistent with the provided annotations and return postconditions.
- The function assumes that `n` and `encrypted_values` are valid (i.e., `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{22}` and `0 ≤ e_i < n` for all `e_i` in `encrypted_values`). There are no checks for these constraints within the function, which means invalid inputs might lead to incorrect behavior but are not explicitly handled in the function itself.
- The function relies on `func_2` to produce meaningful outputs, but no details about `func_2` are provided. Therefore, the exact nature of `f_a` (the output of `func_2`) and its impact on the final state of the program are unknown.
