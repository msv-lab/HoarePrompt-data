The code assigns the maximum value in the list `b` to the variable `max_val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `max_val` will hold the maximum value found in the list `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `b`**
