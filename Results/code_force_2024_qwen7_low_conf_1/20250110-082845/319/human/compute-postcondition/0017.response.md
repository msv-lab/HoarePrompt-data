`a.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` is defined as `[\text{v}, \text{v}]`, which means it contains two elements both equal to `v`. After appending `v` to `a`, the list `a` will now contain three elements, each equal to `v`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is \((\text{encrypted_values}[2] + f_a) \% n\); `a` is \([\text{v}, \text{v}, \text{v}]\); `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `last` is equal to `f_a`; `results` contains \([f_a]\)**
