Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `b`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `b`. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` and `max()` functions cannot operate on an empty list. If the list contains only one element, the function will return 0 since the difference between the single value and itself is zero.**
