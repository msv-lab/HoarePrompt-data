`last` is assigned the value of `f_a`. The value of `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, where `a` is `[v]` and `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`; `a` is `[v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`; `last` is `f_a`.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`; `a` is `[v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`; `last` is `f_a`.**
