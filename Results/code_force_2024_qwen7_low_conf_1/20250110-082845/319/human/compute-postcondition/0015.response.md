According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `q`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `q`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:

- `i` is 1
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `v` is \((\text{encrypted_values}[1] + f_a) \% n\)
- `a` is \([\text{v}, \text{v}]\)
- `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`
- `last` is equal to `f_a`
- `results` contains \([f_a]\)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `q` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop condition.

State: **`i` is 2; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is \((\text{encrypted_values}[1] + f_a) \% n\); `a` is \([\text{v}, \text{v}]\); `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `last` is equal to `f_a`; `results` contains \([f_a]\)**
