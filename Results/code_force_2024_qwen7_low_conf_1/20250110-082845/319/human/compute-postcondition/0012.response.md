The code assigns the return value of `func_2(a)` to `f_a`. Given that `a` is `[v, v]` and `f_a` was previously the return value of `func_2(a)`, `f_a` remains unchanged from its previous value. However, `f_a` is reassigned to the new return value of `func_2(a)`, which means `f_a` now holds this new value. 

Since `last` was previously equal to `f_a`, and `f_a` has been reassigned, `last` also changes to reflect the new value of `f_a`. The value of `v` and `a` remains unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`; `a` is `[v, v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `last` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `results` contains the return value of `func_2(a)`**
