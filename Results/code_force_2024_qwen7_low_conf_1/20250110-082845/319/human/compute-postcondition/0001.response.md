The code assigns the minimum value in the list `b` to the variable `min_val`. Since `b` is a list of non-negative integers, the minimum value in `b` is a non-negative integer. The `max_val` remains the maximum value in the list `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `b`**
