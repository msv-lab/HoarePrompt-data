The code `a.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `a`. Since `v` is defined as `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`, the value of `v` is added to the list `a`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `last`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `v` is `(encrypted_values[0] + last) % n`, `a` is a list containing `[v]`**
