The code `a.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `a`. The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `i` is 1
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`
- `a` is `[v]`
- `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`
- `last` is `f_a`
- `results` contains `f_a`

After executing `a.append(v)`, the list `a` will contain two elements: the original value of `v` and the new value of `v` (since appending adds another instance of `v` to the list).

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `i` remains 1
- `q` remains greater than 0
- `v` remains `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`
- `a` becomes `[v, v]` (the original `v` and the appended `v`)
- `f_a` remains the return value of `func_2(a)`
- `last` remains `f_a`
- `results` contains `f_a`

Output State: **`i` is 1; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[1] + f_a) % n`; `a` is `[v, v]`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)'; `last` is `f_a`; `results` contains `f_a`.**
