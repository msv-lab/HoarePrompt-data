The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. It processes `q` encrypted values using a rolling computation and a helper function `func_2`. Specifically, it iterates over each of the `q` encrypted values, computes the current value `v` as the sum of the current encrypted value and the last computed value modulo `n`, appends `v` to a list `a`, and then calls `func_2` with the updated list `a`. The result of `func_2` is stored in `last` and added to the `results` list. After completing the loop, the function returns the `results` list, which contains `q` elements, each being the output of `func_2` after processing each encrypted value. This process ensures that each element in `results` reflects the cumulative effect of the computations performed on the corresponding encrypted values.
