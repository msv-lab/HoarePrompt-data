Reasoning:
1. The problem description requires computing \( f(a) \) for an array \( a \) which is built up from a series of encrypted values.
2. The provided solution has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement:
   - It processes each encrypted value, decrypts it, appends it to the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2` to compute \( f(a) \).
   - It stores the result of \( f(a) \) in `last` and adds it to the `results` list.
4. `func_2` correctly computes \( f(b) \) as defined: the maximum bitwise OR value minus the minimum bitwise OR value for the array `b`.
5. Both functions handle the edge cases appropriately (e.g., empty list in `func_2` would not occur due to the problem constraints, and the decryption logic is correctly implemented).
6. The overall structure of the program matches the requirements of the problem, and no logical errors are apparent from the given code and descriptions.

Correctness: **True**
