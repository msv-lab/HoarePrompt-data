Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the `f(b)` function as described. Specifically, the `func_2` function only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`, but it does not consider the bitwise OR operation across all elements for different values of `x`. This means that `func_2` will always return the same result as the initial implementation of `f(b)`, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  5 2
  1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0 2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0 2
  ```

While the output matches the expected output for this specific test case, it is incorrect because the program does not compute the maximum value of \(\max_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\). For instance, if the array `a` were `[1, 2]`, the maximum value of the expression would be achieved with \(x = 0\), resulting in \(1 - 0 = 1\), not 2. Therefore, the program does not handle the bitwise OR operation as required, making it incorrect.
