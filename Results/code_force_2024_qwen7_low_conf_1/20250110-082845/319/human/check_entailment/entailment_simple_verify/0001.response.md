Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to process a series of queries on an array `a` and calculate `f(a)` after each insertion, where `f(b)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\).
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`. However, it does not directly implement the definition of `f(b)`. Instead, it only calculates the difference between the bitwise OR operations applied to `x` and the elements of `b` for a specific `x` (which is typically zero). To fully implement `f(b)`, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of `b_i | x` for all `x` and then compute their difference.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes the queries as specified:
   - It initializes an empty array `a` and a variable `last` to keep track of the result from the previous query.
   - For each query, it calculates the current value `v` using the encryption and the `last` result, appends `v` to `a`, and then calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)`.
   - The result of each query is appended to the `results` list, and `last` is updated to the result of the current query.
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial state (empty array `a`) and updates it according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
   - However, `func_2` does not correctly implement `f(b)`. It simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `b` without considering the bitwise OR operations.
   - To correctly implement `f(b)`, we need to find the maximum and minimum values of `b_i | x` for all possible `x` and then compute their difference. The current implementation of `func_2` does not achieve this.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality because `func_2` does not compute `f(b)` as defined in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
