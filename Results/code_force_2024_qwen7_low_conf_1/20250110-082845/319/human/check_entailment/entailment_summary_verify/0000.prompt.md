You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        a.append(v)
        f_a = func_2(a)
        last = f_a
        results.append(f_a)
    return results

#Function 2:
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `b`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `b`. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` and `max()` functions cannot operate on an empty list. If the list contains only one element, the function will return 0 since the difference between the single value and itself is zero.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the `f(b)` function as described. Specifically, the `func_2` function only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`, but it does not consider the bitwise OR operation across all elements for different values of `x`. This means that `func_2` will always return the same result as the initial implementation of `f(b)`, which is not correct according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  5 2
  1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0 2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0 2
  ```

While the output matches the expected output for this specific test case, it is incorrect because the program does not compute the maximum value of \(\max_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\). For instance, if the array `a` were `[1, 2]`, the maximum value of the expression would be achieved with \(x = 0\), resulting in \(1 - 0 = 1\), not 2. Therefore, the program does not handle the bitwise OR operation as required, making it incorrect.
