Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description and Functionality:**
   - We need to compute the function \( f(b) \) defined as:
     \[
     f(b) = \max_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i \text{ OR } x) - \min_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i \text{ OR } x)
     \]
     over all possible non-negative integers \( x \).
   - The program processes \( q \) queries, appending each \( v \) to the array \( a \) and then computing \( f(a) \).

2. **Function Summaries:**
   - `func_2(b)` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `b`.
   - This function does not account for the bitwise OR operation or the maximization/minimization over \( x \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The main logic of the program is in `func_1(n, q, encrypted_values)`, which appends each decrypted value to the array `a` and then calls `func_2(a)` to get the current `f(a)`.
   - The decryption step `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n` ensures that the value appended to `a` is unique for each query.

4. **Behavior of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, without considering any bitwise operations or maximization/minimization over \( x \).
   - Given the definition of \( f(b) \), this function is insufficient to compute the required value.

5. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the test case provided:
     ```
     2
     5 2
     1 2
     ```
   - Initial array \( a = [] \).
   - After the first query:
     - \( v = (1 + 0) \% 5 = 1 \)
     - \( a = [1] \)
     - \( f(a) = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - After the second query:
     - \( v = (2 + 0) \% 5 = 2 \)
     - \( a = [1, 2] \)
     - \( f(a) = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
   - The actual output is `0 1`, but the expected output is `0 2`.

   - The issue lies in the fact that `func_2` only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values, ignoring the bitwise OR operation. The correct maximum difference should be calculated by considering all possible values of \( x \), which is not done in the current implementation.

Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the \( f(b) \) function as required by the problem statement, specifically because it does not account for the bitwise OR operation and the maximization/minimization over \( x \).

Final: **False**
