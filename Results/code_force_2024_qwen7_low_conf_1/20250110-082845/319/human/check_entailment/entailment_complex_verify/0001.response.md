### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to determine the correctness of the provided Python program, which processes a series of queries on an array `a` and calculates \( f(a) \) after each insertion.
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements the definition of \( f(b) \) as the difference between the maximum and minimum bitwise OR values in the array \( b \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`. However, the function should actually compute the difference between the maximum and minimum bitwise OR values in the array `b`, not the arithmetic values.
   - The current implementation does not handle bitwise OR operations correctly. Instead, it uses the arithmetic maximum and minimum values, which is incorrect.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the queries as specified:
     - It initializes an empty array `a` and a variable `last` to keep track of the result from the previous query.
     - For each query, it calculates the current value `v` using the encryption and the `last` result, appends `v` to `a`, and then calls `func_2` to compute \( f(a) \).
     - The result of each query is appended to the `results` list, and `last` is updated to the result of the current query.
   - The function `func_2` is called appropriately to compute \( f(a) \), but it does not perform the bitwise OR operation as required by the problem statement.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly compute \( f(b) \). It computes the arithmetic difference between the maximum and minimum values instead of the bitwise OR values.
   - Therefore, the logic for calculating \( f(a) \) is flawed, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that `func_2` is implemented correctly, when in fact it is not performing the necessary bitwise OR operation. As a result, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

### Final:
Final: **False**
