You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        a.append(v)
        f_a = func_2(a)
        last = f_a
        results.append(f_a)
    return results

#Function 2:
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    encrypted_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = func_1(n, q, encrypted_values)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the upper limit (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{22}), q is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^6), and encrypted_values is a list of q integers representing the encrypted values of v (0 ≤ e_i < n).
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        
        a.append(v)
        
        f_a = func_2(a)
        
        last = f_a
        
        results.append(f_a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `q - 1`; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[q-1] + last) % n`; `a` is a list of length `q` where each element is `v`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`; `last` is `f_a`; `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is `f_a`.
    return results
    #`results` is a list of length `q` where each element is `f_a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`. It processes `q` encrypted values using a rolling computation and a helper function `func_2`. Specifically, it iterates over each of the `q` encrypted values, computes the current value `v` as the sum of the current encrypted value and the last computed value modulo `n`, appends `v` to a list `a`, and then calls `func_2` with the updated list `a`. The result of `func_2` is stored in `last` and added to the `results` list. After completing the loop, the function returns the `results` list, which contains `q` elements, each being the output of `func_2` after processing each encrypted value. This process ensures that each element in `results` reflects the cumulative effect of the computations performed on the corresponding encrypted values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a list of non-negative integers, and the function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
    #`The program returns the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in list 'b'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `b`, which is a list of non-negative integers. It calculates and returns the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list `b`. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` and `max()` functions cannot operate on an empty list. If the list contains only one element, the function will return 0 since the difference between the single value and itself is zero.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine the correctness of the provided Python program, which processes a series of queries on an array `a` and calculates `f(a)` after each insertion.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`. This correctly implements the definition of `f(b)`.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes the queries as specified:
   - It initializes an empty array `a` and a variable `last` to keep track of the result from the previous query.
   - For each query, it calculates the current value `v` using the encryption and the `last` result, appends `v` to `a`, and then calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)`.
   - The result of each query is appended to the `results` list, and `last` is updated to the result of the current query.
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial state (empty array `a`) and updates it according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
   - The function `func_2` is called appropriately to compute `f(a)` after each insertion.
   - The logic for updating `last` and appending results is consistent with the problem's requirements.
   
Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.
