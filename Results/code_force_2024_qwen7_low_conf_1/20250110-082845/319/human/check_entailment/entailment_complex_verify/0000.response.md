### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_2` Implementation**:
   - `func_2` simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `b`.
   - This function does not account for the bitwise OR operation over all possible non-negative integers \( x \), which is a crucial part of the definition of \( f(b) \).

2. **Bitwise OR Operation**:
   - The problem statement defines \( f(b) \) as:
     \[
     f(b) = \max_{i=1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min_{i=1}^{m} (b_i | x)
     \]
     for all possible non-negative integers \( x \).
   - `func_2` only considers the values in `b` without any bitwise OR operations, hence it fails to capture the intended behavior of \( f(b) \).

3. **Query Processing**:
   - In `func_1`, the function processes each query by appending the current value `v` to the list `a` and then calling `func_2` to compute `f(a)`.
   - Since `func_2` does not perform the required bitwise OR operations, the computed results are incorrect.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the example provided:
     - Input:
       ```
       2
       5 2
       1 2
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       0 2
       ```
     - Actual Output:
       ```
       0 2
       ```
   - The output matches the expected result, but this is coincidental and does not reflect the intended behavior of \( f(b) \). For `a = [1, 2]`, the maximum value of \(\max_{i=1}^{2} (b_i | x) - \min_{i=1}^{2} (b_i | x)\) should be \(1\) when \(x = 0\), not \(2\).

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the function \( f(b) \) as defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
