Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating a function \( f(b) \) defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the bitwise OR of each element in the array \( b \) with some non-negative integer \( x \). The goal is to compute this function after each insertion into the array, starting from an empty array.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` takes a list `b` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `b`.
   - This function is correctly implemented and handles edge cases like an empty list (which would raise a `ValueError` but isn't supposed to happen due to how `func_1` manages the initial state).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` initializes an empty array `a` and a variable `last` to store the previous result.
   - For each query, it decrypts the current value using the formula \((e_i + \text{last}) \% n\) and appends it to `a`.
   - It then computes \( f(a) \) using `func_2` and updates `last` with this value.
   - The results are collected in a list `results` and returned.
   - The logic ensures that each step correctly computes the required value based on the definition of \( f(b) \).

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the encryption and decryption of values.
   - It iteratively builds the array `a` and computes the required function \( f(a) \) after each insertion.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the values stay within the bounds defined by `n`.

Given the analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the definitions of the functions involved.

Correctness: **True**
