Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program adheres to the problem specification:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `q`, and the list of encrypted values `e`.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `a` to store the elements of the array `a`.
   - It also initializes `last` to `0` which will be used to store the result of the previous query.
   - It then iterates through each query:
     - For each query, it calculates the actual value `v` using the formula `v = (e_i + last) % n`.
     - It appends `v` to the list `a`.
     - It calls the function `func_2` to compute `f(a)`, which calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum bitwise OR values of the current array `a`.
     - It updates `last` with the computed value `f(a)`.
     - It appends `f(a)` to the results list.

3. **Computing `f(a)`**:
   - The function `func_2` takes a list `b` and computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. In this context, it computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the bitwise OR of the elements of `b`. This is correct because the problem specifies that \( f(b) \) is the maximum value of \(\max_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) \) over all possible non-negative integers \( x \). Since the maximum and minimum values of the bitwise OR of a set of numbers are the values themselves when \( x \) is chosen appropriately, the function `func_2` correctly computes the difference.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all queries, the program prints the results list, which contains the output of each query.

The program handles the encryption and decryption of the values correctly and processes the queries in the specified manner. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases, making it correct.
