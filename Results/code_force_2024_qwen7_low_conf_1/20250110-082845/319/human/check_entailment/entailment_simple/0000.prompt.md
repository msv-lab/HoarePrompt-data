You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    encrypted_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = func_1(n, q, encrypted_values)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the upper limit (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{22}), q is an integer representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^6), and encrypted_values is a list of q integers representing the encrypted values of v (0 ≤ e_i < n).
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        
        a.append(v)
        
        f_a = func_2(a)
        
        last = f_a
        
        results.append(f_a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `q - 1`; `q` must be greater than 0; `v` is `(encrypted_values[q-1] + last) % n`; `a` is a list of length `q` where each element is `v`; `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`; `last` is `f_a`; `results` is a list of length `q` where each element is `f_a`.
    return results
    #`results` is a list of length `q` where each element is `f_a`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a list of non-negative integers, and the function calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list.
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
    #`The program returns the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in list 'b'`


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
