n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, and the characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, . (no transition video specified yet), or . (no transition video needed since i = j). It is guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., F or S).
