Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type.

Hereâ€™s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic for Assigning Values**: The program attempts to assign values to undecided transition videos (`?`) based on the counts of already decided transition videos (`F` and `S`). However, it does not properly enforce the constraint that no permutation should have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The logic within the if-else block does not adequately handle the assignment of `F` or `S` to undecided positions to ensure the constraint is met. The program simply assigns `F` or `S` based on whether the current or the previous indices are in `sa` or `sb`, but this does not guarantee the required constraint is satisfied for all permutations.

3. **Handling Undecided Values**: The program does not consider all possible sequences of `F` and `S` for undecided values to ensure the constraint holds for every permutation. Instead, it makes decisions based on simple heuristics which might not be sufficient to cover all cases.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving dynamic programming or backtracking, to ensure that the generated sequence of transition videos satisfies the given constraint for all permutations of scenarios.

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
