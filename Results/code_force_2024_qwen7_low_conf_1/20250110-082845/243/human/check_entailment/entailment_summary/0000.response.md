Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by creating a valid assignment of 'F' and 'S' to undecided transition videos while ensuring the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. However, upon closer inspection, several issues are present:

1. **Initialization and Calculation**:
   - The arrays `a` and `b` are initialized to store counts of 'F' and 'S' transition videos, respectively, but they are indexed starting from 0, which is incorrect since the problem specifies indices from 1 to n. This should start from index 1.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values**:
   - The logic to determine whether to add undecided scenarios (`'?'`) to `sa` or `sb` is flawed. The current implementation only considers the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor - 1\) undecided scenarios, which might not cover all necessary scenarios.
   - The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided scenarios based on the size of `sa` and `sb` is also incomplete and does not guarantee a valid solution.

3. **Construction of Transition Videos**:
   - The final loop constructs transition videos by appending 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions. However, these conditions do not ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type is met.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution and might fail to generate a valid transition video plan for some inputs.

Correctness: **False**
