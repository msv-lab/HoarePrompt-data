### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program `func()` step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to keep track of the count of funny and scary transition videos, respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `xx` to store the input strings representing the current state of the transition videos.

2. **Processing Input**:
   - For each of the `n` lines of input, the program processes the string character by character.
   - If a character is 'F', it increments the count of funny videos for both scenarios involved.
   - If a character is 'S', it increments the count of scary videos for both scenarios involved.
   - The program stores the processed string in the list `xx`.

3. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - Two lists `sa` and `sb` are initialized to store indices of scenarios where only funny or only scary videos are decided, respectively.
   - The program iterates over the scenarios and checks if a scenario has only funny or only scary videos decided. If so, it appends the index to the respective list.

4. **Decision Logic**:
   - The program decides whether to add more funny or scary videos.
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to `sb`, it chooses to add more funny videos by ensuring that the scenarios with undecided videos are filled with funny videos if they are among the first `n//4 - 1` scenarios.
   - Otherwise, it chooses to add more scary videos by ensuring that the scenarios with undecided videos are filled with scary videos if they are among the first `n//4 - 1` scenarios.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - For each scenario, the program generates a new string `nx` by checking if the original input character is known ('F' or 'S') or unknown ('?').
   - If unknown, it decides the value based on the rules defined in the decision logic.
   - The generated string `nx` is printed for each scenario.

### Verification:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when the input is fully decided or partially decided.
   - It ensures that the constraints of the problem are met by filling the undecided videos in a way that no more than `⌈3n/4⌉` videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of filling the undecided videos is correct because it ensures that the constraints are met while making minimal changes to the given input.
   - The program correctly identifies the scenarios that need to be filled and fills them in a way that satisfies the requirement.

3. **Compliance**:
   - The program adheres to the problem statement and constraints, ensuring that the output meets the specified requirements.

### Conclusion:

The given Python program `func()` correctly implements the logic to generate the full transition video plan based on the constraints provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
