Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the constraints of the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to assign types (funny or scary) to undecided transition videos in a way that ensures no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios. However, the logic within the function does not adequately ensure this condition for all possible permutations.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input for \( n = 4 \):

```
.???
.?..
.?..
....
```

The program's output for this input might look like:

```
FFFF
FFFF
FFFF
.....
```

However, if we permute the scenarios as (1, 4, 2, 3), the sequence of transition videos would be:

```
F
F
F
.
```

This results in 3 consecutive 'F' videos, which is not allowed since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 4}{4} \rceil = 3\).

A valid solution for this case would be:

```
.SSF
.SSF
.SSF
...
```

This ensures no more than 3 consecutive 'S' or 'F' videos for any permutation.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
