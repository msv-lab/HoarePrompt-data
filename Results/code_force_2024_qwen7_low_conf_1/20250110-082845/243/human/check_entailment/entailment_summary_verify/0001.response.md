### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given Python program `func()` step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S'.
   - It also stores the input strings in the list `xx`.

2. **Processing Input**:
   - The program correctly processes the input strings and updates the counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario.

3. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - The program initializes two lists `sa` and `sb` to store indices of scenarios with only 'F' or only 'S' decisions, respectively.
   - It correctly populates these lists based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'.

4. **Decision Logic**:
   - The program decides whether to add more funny or scary videos based on the relative sizes of `sa` and `sb`.
   - However, the logic to fill the undecided videos ('?') is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the first `n//4 - 1` scenarios should be filled with funny or scary videos, depending on the larger list (`sa` or `sb`).

5. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates the final output strings `nx` by checking the original input character or deciding based on the rules.
   - The logic for deciding the character ('F' or 'S') is incorrect. The program should ensure that no more than `⌈3n/4⌉` videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Decision Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the first `n//4 - 1` scenarios should be filled with funny or scary videos, which does not guarantee that the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.

2. **Insufficient Constraints Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the requirement that no more than `⌈3n/4⌉` videos of the same type appear consecutively in all permutations. The current logic does not enforce this constraint adequately.

3. **Unnecessary Complexity**:
   - The program's logic is overly complex and does not correctly ensure the required constraint for all permutations.

### Verification:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that no more than `⌈3n/4⌉` videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of scenarios. The current implementation fails to handle all permutations correctly.

### Conclusion:

The given Python program `func()` does not correctly implement the logic to generate the full transition video plan based on the constraints provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
