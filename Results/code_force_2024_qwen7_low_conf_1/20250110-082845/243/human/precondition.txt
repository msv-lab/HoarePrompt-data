n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters. The j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. It will be 'F' if the corresponding transition video will be funny, 'S' if the corresponding transition video will be scary, '?' if the corresponding transition video is still undecided, or '.' if i=j. At most ⌊n/2⌋ transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.
