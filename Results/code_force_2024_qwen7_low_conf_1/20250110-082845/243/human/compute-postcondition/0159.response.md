Postcondition: ***`nx` is an empty string. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. Specifically, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0.***
