The `print(nx)` statement outputs the value of `nx` but does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `nx` remains the same as it was in the initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is a string constructed by appending `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' otherwise, for `j` from 1 to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.**
