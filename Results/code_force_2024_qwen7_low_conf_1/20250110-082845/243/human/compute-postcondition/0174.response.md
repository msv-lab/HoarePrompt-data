Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nx` is a string constructed by appending `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' otherwise, for `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` runs for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`.

3. **Current State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range specified by the loop condition, which is from 1 to `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is out of the specified range (1 to `n`).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to adjust the state of `nx`, `i`, or `n`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop cannot execute again based on the current values of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No adjustment needed as the loop cannot execute again.**
