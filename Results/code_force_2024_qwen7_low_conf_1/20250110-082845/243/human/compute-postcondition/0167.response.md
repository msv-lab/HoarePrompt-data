The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the string `nx` by concatenating it with the character at index `j - 1` of the list `xx[i]`. However, there is no definition of `xx` in the provided initial state, and the values of `i` and `j` are defined in terms of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is an empty string (`""`)
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `n + 2`
- `n` is greater than 0

Since `xx` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact character that will be concatenated to `nx`. However, the structure of the code implies that `xx` should be a list of lists, and `i` and `j` should be valid indices within this structure.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string `""`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `xx` is undefined.**
