According to the given for loop statement, the loop will execute as long as the value of `j` (which is being iterated over) is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `n`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `j` must be within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - Currently, `j` is set to `n + 1`, which means it is one more than the upper bound of the range. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value within the range of the loop.
   - Since the loop starts from 1 and ends just before `n + 1`, `j` should be at least 1 but less than `n + 1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `j` to a value within the valid range of the loop (1 to `n`).

Given this analysis, the required adjustments are:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string**
