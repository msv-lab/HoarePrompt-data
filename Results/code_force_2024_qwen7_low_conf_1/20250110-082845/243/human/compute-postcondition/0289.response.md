Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after the loop has executed.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `nx` is an empty string `""`

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'
```

### Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - The loop body checks three conditions for each iteration:
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, then append `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`.
     - If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then append `'S'` to `nx`.
     - Otherwise, append `'F'` to `nx`.

2. **Final Iteration Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1`.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` and never modifies `i`.

3. **Value of `nx`**:
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, the value of `nx` depends on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and the conditions mentioned.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` accumulates these characters.
   - If `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` appends `'S'`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` appends `'F'`.

### Final Output State

- **Variables**:
  - `i`: Remains `n + 1`.
  - `j`: Becomes `n + 1`.
  - `nx`: Accumulated based on the conditions described.

### Conclusion

After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `nx` is a string that concatenates:
  - Characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` (if they are not `?`) for each `j` from 1 to `n`.
  - `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
  - `'F'` otherwise.

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string constructed by the loop according to the specified conditions.**
