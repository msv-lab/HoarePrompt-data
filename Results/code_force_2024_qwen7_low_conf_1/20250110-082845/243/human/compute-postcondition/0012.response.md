`b[i]` is assigned the value of `b[i] + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, `j` must be within the range [1, n+1), and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[1]` is increased by 1.
