`nx` is assigned the value `'S'` and added to its current value. Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, we assume it starts as an empty string `''`. Therefore, after executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes `'S'`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[1][0]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, and `xx[1][0]` is '?'; `nx` is 'S'**
