The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` was before this operation, we can only say that `nx` was previously some string and now it is that string plus 'S'.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` plus 'S'**
