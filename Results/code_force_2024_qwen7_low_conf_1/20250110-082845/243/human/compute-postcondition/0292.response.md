Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `a[k] > 0` and `b[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `b[k] > 0` and `a[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx` is a string constructed by appending `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` if it is not `?`, or 'F' or 'S' otherwise for `j` from 1 to `n`, and `t` is the length of `sa`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string constructed based on the rules described after executing the loop for `n` times, and `nx` is printed.**
