The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`
- `nx` is either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if it is not '?'), or `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `'F'`

Since `i` is `n + 1`, it means `i` is not within the range of `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` because `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` would only contain elements from `0` to `n // 4 - 1`. Therefore, `nx` will be `'F'` because neither `i` nor `j` falls within the specified condition.

Now, adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx` will change the value of `nx`:

- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` will become `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` remains `'F'`.

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, the condition `i in sb[:n // 4 - 1]` is false, so `nx` will be `'F'` regardless of the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, and `nx` is `'F'`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, and `nx` is `'F'`**
