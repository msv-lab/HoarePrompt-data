Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` is updated to include `'S' + xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is present in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is updated to include `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include `'SF'`.**
