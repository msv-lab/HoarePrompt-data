Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing `[1, 2]`, `sb` is a list containing `[1]` if `b[2] > 0` and `a[2] == 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list; `a[2]` is either greater than 0 or equal to 0, and `b[2]` is either equal to 0 or greater than 0; if the condition `a[2] > 0 and b[2] == 0` is true, `sb` becomes a list containing `[1]`***
