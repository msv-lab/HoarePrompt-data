`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it means `xx[1][0]` is updated to a specific value. Since the exact value of `xx[1][0]` is not provided, we can denote it as `val`. Therefore, `nx` is increased by `val`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `nx` is `nx + val`, where `val` is the value of `xx[1][0]`.**
