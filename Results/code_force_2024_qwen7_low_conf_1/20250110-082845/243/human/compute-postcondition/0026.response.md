The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n`, and `b` is an undefined list, we assume `b` is a list that must exist to perform the operation. Since `i` is 1, `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n`, `b[1]` is increased by 1**
