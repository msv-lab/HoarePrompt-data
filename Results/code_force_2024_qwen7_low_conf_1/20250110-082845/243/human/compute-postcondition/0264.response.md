In the given initial state, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string constructed based on certain conditions involving `xx` and `sb`. The code simply prints `nx`.

Since `nx` is already defined before the print statement, the print statement does not change the value of `nx`. It only outputs its current value.

To determine the exact value of `nx`, we would need more details about the lists `xx` and `sb`, which are not provided. However, since no changes occur to the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, or `nx` within the given code snippet, we can conclude the following:

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is the previously defined string based on the conditions, and the value of `nx` is printed.**
