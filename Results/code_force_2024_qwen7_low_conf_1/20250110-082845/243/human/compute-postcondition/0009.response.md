The code snippet `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `j` is an index such that `x[j-1]` is 'F', and `a[1]` is `a[1] + 1`. However, the exact value of `j` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `a[j]` without knowing `j`. But we know that `a[j]` will be incremented by 1.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `x[j-1]`, and `a[1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `x[j-1]` is 'F'; `a[1]` is `a[1] + 1`; `a[j]` is increased by 1**
