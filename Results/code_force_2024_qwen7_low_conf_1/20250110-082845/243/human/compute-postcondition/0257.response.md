Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
   - `j` is 2
   - `nx` is updated based on specific conditions

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Conditions for Updating `nx`:**
   - If `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[1][1]` to its current value.
   - Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `nx` is determined based on the above conditions.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` will increment to 3, we need to consider the new value of `j`.
   - The value of `i` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

7. **Updating `nx`:**
   - We need to check if `j == 3` falls into the condition where `nx` is updated. Specifically, we need to check if `j` (which is now 3) is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, we need to check if `3 <= n // 4 - 1`.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that changes is `j`, which will be 3.
   - The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `j` is 3
- `nx` will be updated based on the conditions described.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[1][1]` to its current value; otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'**
