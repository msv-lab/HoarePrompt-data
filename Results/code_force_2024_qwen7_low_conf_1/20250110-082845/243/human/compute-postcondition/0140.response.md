To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and how they affect the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is unchanged.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][n]`.
   - If either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with `'F'`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is its initial value plus `'S'`.

3. **Determine the Value of `j` for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration until `j = n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration of the Loop:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n + 2`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `j` changes to `n + 2`.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` (which is `xx[i][n + 1]`) and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration.

6. **Conditions to Consider:**
   - Check if `xx[i][n + 1]` is not `'?'`.
   - Determine if `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments:

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration.**

Note: The exact value of `nx` will depend on the outcomes of the checks in the next iteration, but the state of the variables `i` and `j` are what needs to be explicitly stated here.
