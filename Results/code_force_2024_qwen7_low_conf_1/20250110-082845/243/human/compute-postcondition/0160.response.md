Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `nx` is an empty string (`""`).
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`.
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
    - `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.
    - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
  - `i` is `n + 1`.
  - `n` is greater than 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Iteration End**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, we know that `i` is exactly `n + 1` and `j` starts from 1 up to `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - To enter the next iteration of the loop, `j` needs to be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`, but `j` cannot exceed `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `n + 1` for the current iteration to proceed to the next one.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, the condition for the next iteration would be `j == n + 1`.
   - The value of `nx` does not change because the loop has not yet executed, and `i` remains `n + 1`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `n + 1`.
- The value of `nx` remains unchanged as it depends on the loop body which has not been executed yet.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`nx` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`**.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`nx` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`**.
