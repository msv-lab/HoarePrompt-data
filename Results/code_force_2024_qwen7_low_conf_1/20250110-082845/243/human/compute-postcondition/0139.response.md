Postcondition: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`. If the following conditions are met:
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'", then `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][n]`.
- Either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with `'F'`.
- Otherwise, `nx` is its initial value plus `'S'`.**
