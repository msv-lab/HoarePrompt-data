The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `b[2]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `b[2]` was set to the previous value of `b[2]`, which means its value before the increment was `b[2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `b[2]` is the previous value of `b[2]` plus 1. Since `b[2]` was previously the count of 'S' characters up to and including the 2nd character in `x`, and now it is incremented by 1, the updated value of `b[2]` is the previous count plus 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x]`, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character, and `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character, `x` is an input string, `j` is 2, `b[2]` is the previous value of `b[2]` plus 1.**
