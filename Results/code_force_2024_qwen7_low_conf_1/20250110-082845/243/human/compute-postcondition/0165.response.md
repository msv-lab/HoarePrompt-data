Postcondition: ***`nx` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is either `"F"` or `"S"`, and `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is `"F"`. Otherwise, `nx` is `"S"`.***
