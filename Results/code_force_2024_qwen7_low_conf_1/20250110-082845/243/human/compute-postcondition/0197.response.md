Postcondition: **`nx` is a string. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` remains unchanged. `j` is `n + 2`, and `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions.**
