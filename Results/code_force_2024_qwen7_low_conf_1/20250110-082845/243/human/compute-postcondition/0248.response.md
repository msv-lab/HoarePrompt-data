The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, we can assume it is an empty string (`''`) because there's no prior assignment mentioned for `nx`. After appending 'F', `nx` will become `'F'`.

Other variables such as `i`, `n`, `j`, `xx[1][0]`, and the condition checks for `sb` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, and `xx[1][0]` is '?', `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
