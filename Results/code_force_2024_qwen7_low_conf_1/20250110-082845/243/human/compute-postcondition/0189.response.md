`nx` is a string and its value is updated by appending 'S' to it. The original value of `nx` is a string, so after appending 'S', `nx` becomes the original string concatenated with 'S'. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original string concatenated with 'S', `j` is `n + 1`, `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions.**
