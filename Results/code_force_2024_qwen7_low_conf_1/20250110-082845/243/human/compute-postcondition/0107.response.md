Postcondition: ***`i` is 3; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings; `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3]`; `sb` is a list containing `[1, 2, 3, 3]`. If `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, then `sb` is updated to contain `[1, 2, 3, 1]`. Otherwise, `sb` remains unchanged.***
