`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `j` is `n + 2`, so `j - 1` is `n + 1`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include the value of `xx[i][n + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` is included in `nx`, `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration.**
