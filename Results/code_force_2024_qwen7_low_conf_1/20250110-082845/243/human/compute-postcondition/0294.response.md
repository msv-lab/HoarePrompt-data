Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of \( n \) lines, each containing \( n \) characters that represent transition videos between scenarios. These characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (indicating a undecided transition video), or '.' (no transition video needed). The function calculates counts of 'F' and 'S' characters up to each scenario and then determines two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on these counts. Depending on the relative sizes of `sa` and `sb`, it either assigns values to `sa` or `sb`. Finally, the function constructs and prints a new set of transition videos for each scenario, ensuring that the number of scary videos does not exceed the number of funny videos by more than a quarter of the total scenarios. If the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters do not allow such construction, the function ensures that the number of funny videos does not exceed the number of scary videos by more than a quarter.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 24, the function will raise an error because the input size is constrained.
- If all characters in the input are '.', the function will still process the input and construct a new set of transition videos based on the given rules.
- If the input contains only 'F' or only 'S', the function will still process the input and ensure that the new set of transition videos satisfies the constraints.
- If no valid configuration can be found, the function will fill in the undecided transitions ('?') with 'F' or 'S' based on the majority rule, ensuring the constraints are met.
