Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`.
   - `nx` is either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if it is not '?'), or `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `'F'`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.

4. **Updated States**:
   - Since `i` is already `n + 1`, it won't change.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `nx` will depend on the new value of `j` (which is `j + 1`), but since the problem does not specify how `nx` changes, we only update `j`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j + 1` must still be less than `n + 1`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `nx` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, and `nx` is either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if it is not '?'), or `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `'F'`**.
