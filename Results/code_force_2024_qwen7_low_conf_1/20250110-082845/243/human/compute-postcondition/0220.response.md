The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the existing value of `nx`. Given that `nx` was initially an empty string (`""`), appending 'S' to it results in `nx` becoming `'S'`. 

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is now `'S'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`**
