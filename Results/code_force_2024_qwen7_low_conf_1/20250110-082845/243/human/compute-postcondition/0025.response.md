`a[j]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is equal to `n`, `a[n]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, and `j` is still `n`. The state of `a[1]` is updated to be incremented by 1, and `a[n]` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `j` is `n`; `a[1]` is incremented by 1; `a[n]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `j` is `n`; `a[1]` is incremented by 1; `a[n]` is incremented by 1**
