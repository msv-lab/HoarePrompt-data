Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `a[k] > 0` and `b[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list; `sb` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `b[k] > 0` and `a[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
