The code adds the string `'F'` to the variable `nx`. Since `nx` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be an empty string initially. The value of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition about their values being in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` still holds.

Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is a '?', `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `nx` is `'F'`, the current value of `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or the current value of `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
