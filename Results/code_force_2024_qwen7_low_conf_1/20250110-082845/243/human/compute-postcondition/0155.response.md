The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Since `nx` is initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` will become `'F'`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and conditions involving `sa`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
