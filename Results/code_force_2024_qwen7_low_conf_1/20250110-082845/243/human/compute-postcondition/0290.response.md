The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of the variable `nx` but does not change the value of any variable. Therefore, the only change is that `nx` is printed, but its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `nx` is a string constructed by the loop according to the specified conditions; `nx` is printed**
