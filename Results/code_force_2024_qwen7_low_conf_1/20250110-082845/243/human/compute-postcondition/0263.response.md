Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is a string constructed based on the following conditions for each `(i, j)` pair in the range `1` to `n`:
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` contains the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` contains 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`; otherwise, `nx` contains 'F'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n`. For each iteration, `j` is incremented by `1`.
- After `n` iterations, `j` becomes `n + 1`, and the loop terminates.
- During each iteration, `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and the condition involving `i` and `j` being checked against `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.
- The final value of `nx` is determined by all the updates made during the loop iterations, following the specified conditions.
