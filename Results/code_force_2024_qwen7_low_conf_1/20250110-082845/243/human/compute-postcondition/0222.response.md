`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus 'F'. This means that the string in `nx` is updated by appending 'F' to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is now the original `nx` plus 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'.
