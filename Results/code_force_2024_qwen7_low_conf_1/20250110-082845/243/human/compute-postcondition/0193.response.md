`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `j` is `n + 2`, so `j - 1` is `n + 1`. Therefore, `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][n + 1]` to its current value. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `xx`) are not affected.

Output State: **`nx` is a string updated by appending `xx[i][n + 1]` to its current value, `j` is `n + 2`, `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions**
