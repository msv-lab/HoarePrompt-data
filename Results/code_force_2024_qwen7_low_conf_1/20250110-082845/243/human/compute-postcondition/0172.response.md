Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `nx` is an empty string.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'
```

### Observations from the Given Output States
1. After 1 iteration:
   - `nx` is an empty string.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. After 2 iterations:
   - `nx` is an empty string (`""`).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. After 3 iterations:
   - `nx` is an empty string (`""`).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 2`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

### Analysis
From the given output states, we observe that:
- The loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`.
- The loop does not change `i` because `i` starts at `n + 1` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.

### Final Iteration Analysis
- The loop will continue to run until `j` reaches `n + 1`, but since `i` is always `n + 1`, the condition `j < n + 1` will eventually become false.
- Therefore, the loop will exit after `j` reaches `n + 1`.

### Final Values
- `nx` will be constructed based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` for `j` from 1 to `n + 1`. However, since `i` is always `n + 1`, the effective range for `j` is from 1 to `n`.
- If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` will append that value.
- If `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` will append either `F` or `S` based on whether `n + 1` (which is `i`) is in the first quarter of `sa` or not.

### Conclusion
Since the loop does not modify `i` and only runs through the range of `j` from 1 to `n`, the final value of `nx` will be determined by the values of `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` for `j` from 1 to `n`.

### Output State
- `nx` is a string constructed based on the values of `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` for `j` from 1 to `n`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` is not `?` for all `j` from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string constructed by appending `xx[n + 1][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' otherwise, for `j` from 1 to `n`. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is a positive integer.**
