Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is set to `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is the original `nx` plus `'F'`. Additionally, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to `?`**
