Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `nx` is a string constructed by concatenating values based on certain conditions.
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we know the current state of `i`.

### Current State
- We are given the state at the end of the previous iteration.
- `nx` is constructed by concatenating values based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The loop is currently iterating over `i`.

### Loop Conditions
The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

### Previous Iteration Details
- The loop has just finished its iteration with `i` equal to some value `i_end` (which is `n`).

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

### Adjusting States
- Since the loop is about to start its next iteration with `i = i_end + 1`, we need to update the state accordingly.
- The value of `nx` remains unchanged as it is constructed based on the loop iterations, but we need to reflect the updated value of `i`.

### Updated State
- The state at the start of the next iteration should show that `i` is now `i_end + 1`.
- The value of `nx` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Example Answer
Given that the loop just finished with `i` being `n` (assuming `n` is the upper limit of the range), the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

State: **`nx` is the string constructed by the loop, `i` is `n + 1`**.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is the string constructed by the loop, `i` is `n + 1`**.
