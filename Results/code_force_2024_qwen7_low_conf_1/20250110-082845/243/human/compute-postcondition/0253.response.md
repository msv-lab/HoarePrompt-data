`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'S'`. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `nx`, we assume it to be an empty string for the purpose of this calculation. After executing `nx += 'S'`, the value of `nx` becomes `'S'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'S'**
