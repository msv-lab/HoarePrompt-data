The code `sb = []` creates an empty list named `sb`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, or `sa`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated definition of `sb` as an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th character, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th character; `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list**.
