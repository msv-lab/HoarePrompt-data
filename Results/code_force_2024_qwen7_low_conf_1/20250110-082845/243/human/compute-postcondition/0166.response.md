Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is an empty string (`""`).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **What Changes During Each Iteration?**
   - `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The condition `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'` is checked.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` is set to `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1] == '?'`, then `nx` is set to `"F"` or `"S"`, depending on the position of `i` and `j` relative to `sa`.

4. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `n + 2`.

5. **Checking the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` is now `n + 2`, we need to check if this value satisfies the loop condition `j in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - This condition will not be satisfied because `j` is `n + 2`, which is out of the range `1` to `n`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is `n + 2` and the loop condition is not met, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, no further changes to the states are needed as the loop will not execute again.

7. **Final State:**
   - `nx` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains `n + 1`.
   - `j` becomes `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen due to the loop condition) would be:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
