`b[i]` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is 3, `b[i]` which is initially an element in list `b` at index 3, gets incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `xx` is `[x, x]`; `a` and `b` are lists as defined; `x` is a non-empty string; the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S'; `b[3]` is incremented by 1.**
