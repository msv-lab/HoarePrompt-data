`nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`. The initial state of `nx` is an empty string, so after the concatenation, `nx` becomes `'S'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition involving `sb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is `'S'`, and either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
