`nx` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with 'F'. The value of `n` and the conditions regarding `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is an empty string plus 'F', which makes `nx` equal to 'F'; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'; `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
