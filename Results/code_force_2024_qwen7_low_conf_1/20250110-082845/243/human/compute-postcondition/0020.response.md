`b[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is equal to `n`, the value of `b[n]` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, `j` is `n`, and `b[n]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, `j` is `n`, and `b[n]` is incremented by 1.**
