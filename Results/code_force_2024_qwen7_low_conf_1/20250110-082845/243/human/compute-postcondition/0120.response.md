Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, `sa` is `[2, 3]` if `a[2]` was 0 and `b[2]` was 0, otherwise it remains unchanged, `sb` is an empty list, `t` is 1 if `a[2]` was 0 and `b[2]` was 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition. Given that the if condition `a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0` holds true when `a[2]` is 0 and `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is updated to `[2, 3]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the if part's postcondition.
