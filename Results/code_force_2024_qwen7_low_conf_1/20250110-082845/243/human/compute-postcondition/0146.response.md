To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states.

### Analysis of the Loop

The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`. For each iteration, the following operations are performed based on the condition inside the loop:

1. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, then `nx` is updated by concatenating `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`.
2. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`:
   - If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `i` or `j` is less than `n // 4`), then `nx` is updated by appending `'F'` to `nx`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is updated by appending `'S'` to `nx`.

### Iteration Analysis

From the provided output states for the first few iterations:

- **After 1 iteration**: `nx` is updated based on whether `xx[i][0]` is `?` or not. If it is not `?`, `nx` gets that value. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `'F'` if either `i` or `j` (which is 1) is in the first quarter of `sa`, or `'S'` otherwise.
- **After 2 iterations**: `nx` is updated based on `xx[i][1]` and the condition checks for `i` or `j` being in the first quarter of `sa`.
- **After 3 iterations**: `nx` is updated based on `xx[i][2]` and the condition checks for `i` or `j` being in the first quarter of `sa`.

### Final Output State

By examining the loop and the provided output states, we can conclude that after the loop completes (i.e., when `j` reaches `n + 1`):

- `nx` will be a string constructed by concatenating characters from `xx[i][0]` to `xx[i][n]` (inclusive) according to the rules defined in the loop.
- The value of `nx` depends on whether `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?` or not and the position of `i` and `j` relative to `sa`.

Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`, it means that all elements from `xx[i][0]` to `xx[i][n]` will be considered. The final value of `nx` will be determined by the concatenation of these elements, taking into account the conditions specified in the loop.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`nx` is a string constructed by concatenating the values of `xx[i][0]` to `xx[i][n]` based on the conditions inside the loop: if `xx[i][j-1]` is not `?`, append `xx[i][j-1]` to `nx`; otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `i < n // 4` or `j < n // 4`), append `'F'` to `nx`; otherwise, append `'S'` to `nx`.**
