The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The initial state of `nx` is not specified, so let's assume it was an empty string or contained some other characters before this operation. However, since the exact initial value of `nx` is not given, we will consider it to be an empty string for the sake of this example.

Given the initial state:
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is a '?'
- `i` is an integer
- `j` is an integer
- Neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`

After running the code `nx += 'S'`:
- `nx` is updated to include the character 'S' appended to its current value.

Since no other changes were made to the variables and the conditions regarding `i` and `j` remain unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is a '?', `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; `nx` is `nx` (an empty string or previously existing string) + 'S'**
