Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`. This means the loop has completed all iterations up to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `n + 1` to `n + 2`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `n + 2`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, we need to update the value of `j` to `n + 2`.
   - All other variables (`nx`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop directly.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 2`, and `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions**.
