Postcondition: ***`nx` is an empty string `""`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` remains an empty string. Otherwise, `nx` is either `'F'` or `"S"`, depending on whether `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. If both conditions are false, `nx` is `"S"`.***
