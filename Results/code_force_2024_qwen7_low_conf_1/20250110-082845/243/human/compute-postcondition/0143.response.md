The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string stored in the variable `nx`. However, there is no initial value provided for `nx` in the initial state. Since the value of `nx` is not specified, we can only say that `nx` is modified by appending 'S' to its current value.

Other variables (`i`, `j`, `xx[i][n + 1]`, `xx[i][n]`) remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S', `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration.**
