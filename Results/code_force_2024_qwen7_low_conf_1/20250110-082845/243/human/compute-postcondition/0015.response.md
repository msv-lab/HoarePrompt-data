Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, `j` must be within the range [1, n+1). If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1 and `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
