The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` is initially an empty string (`""`), after appending 'F', `nx` becomes `'F'`.

The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The condition that `n` is greater than 0 is also still valid.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `nx` is now `'F'`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is `n + 2`
- `n` is greater than 0

Output State: **`nx` is `'F'`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0**
