`x` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means `x` will hold the user's input. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input**
