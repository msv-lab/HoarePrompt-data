`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus the string `'S'`. This means that `nx` is now an empty string plus `'S'`, which results in `'S'`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is `'S'`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is `'S'`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', and neither `i` nor `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
