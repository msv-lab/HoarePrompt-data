Postcondition: ***`i` is 2; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings; `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 â‰¤ \( k \) â‰¤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing `[1, 2]`; `sb` is a list containing `[1]` if `b[2] > 0` and `a[2] == 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list; if the condition `a[2] > 0 and b[2] == 0` is true, `sb` becomes a list containing `[1]`. The if statement updates `sb` to `[1]` if `b[2] > 0` and `a[2] == 0`.***
