`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `j` is `n + 1`, so `j - 1` is `n`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to include the element from the list `xx` at index `i` and position `n`.

Output State: **`nx` is a string with the additional element `xx[i][n]` appended, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` and `n` remain consistent with their preconditions.**
