The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `b` is assigned a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the value of `a` is still a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0**
