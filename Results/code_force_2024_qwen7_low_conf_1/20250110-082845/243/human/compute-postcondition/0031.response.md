The code `xx.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `xx`. The initial state includes that `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, and `a` and `b` are lists where for each index `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the k-th character, and `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the k-th character. After appending `x` to `xx`, the length of `xx` increases by 1, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x]`, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n), `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the k-th character, and `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the k-th character.**
