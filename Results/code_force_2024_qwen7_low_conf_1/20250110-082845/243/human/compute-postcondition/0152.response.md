`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Therefore, `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is an empty string plus `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
