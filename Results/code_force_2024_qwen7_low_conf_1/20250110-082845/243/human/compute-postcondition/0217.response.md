`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[1][0]`. Given that the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', let's denote this value as `val`. Therefore, `nx` becomes `nx + val`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is now `nx + val`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is `nx + val`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
