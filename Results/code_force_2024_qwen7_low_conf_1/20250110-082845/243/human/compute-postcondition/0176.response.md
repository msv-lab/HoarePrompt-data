According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will start as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `nx` is an empty string, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop condition is met.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
