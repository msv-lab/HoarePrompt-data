Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings
   - `a` and `b` are lists as defined
   - `sa` is a list as defined
   - `sb` is a list as defined

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The condition inside the loop checks if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`.
     - If it is not `?`, then `nx` is updated to `nx + val`.
     - If it is `?`, then:
       - If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is set to `'S'`.
       - Otherwise, `nx` is the original `nx` plus `'F'`.

4. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are starting the next iteration of the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will now be 2.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains 1 (since the loop is incrementing `j`, not `i`).
   - `n` remains at least 1 (unchanged).
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop body.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2.
   - The other states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined.**
