`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus the string `'F'`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will contain the string `'F'`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the condition involving `sb`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
