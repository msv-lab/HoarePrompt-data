Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is `n + 1`
  - `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`
  - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is `'F'`.
  - Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either `'S'` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or `'SS'` (if `nx` was originally `'S'`) or `'FS'` (if `nx` was originally `'F'`).
  - Otherwise, `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Previous Iteration State:**
   - `i` is already `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, it can still increase up to `n`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1` in the next iteration.

### Updated States:
- `i` remains `n + 1` because `i` is not changed within the loop.
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `nx` remains unchanged unless the conditions inside the loop body change its value.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `nx` remains as it was in the previous iteration unless the loop body changes it.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is as described previously.**

This means:
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `j` becomes `j + 1`, so `j` is now at least 3 but less than `n + 1`.
- `nx` retains its previous value unless the loop body changes it.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is as described previously.**
