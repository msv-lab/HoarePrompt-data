Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with `'S'` if `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`. Otherwise, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` appended with `'F'`.***
