Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions. If either `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original string concatenated with 'S'.***
