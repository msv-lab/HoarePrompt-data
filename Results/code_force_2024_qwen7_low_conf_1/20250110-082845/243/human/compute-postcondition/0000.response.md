The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer represents the number of scenarios. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. After executing this line of code, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input, but the exact value is not known without further input. All other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user, 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 24; the value of `n` is increased by assigning the input value to it.**
