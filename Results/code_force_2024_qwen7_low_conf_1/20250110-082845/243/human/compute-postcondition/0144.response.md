Postcondition: ***`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration. If either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element), `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with `'F'`. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus `'S'`.***
