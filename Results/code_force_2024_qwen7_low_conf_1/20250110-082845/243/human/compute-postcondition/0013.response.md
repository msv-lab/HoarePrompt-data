`b[j]` is assigned the value of `b[j] + 1`. Since `b[1]` was initially increased by 1, and no other changes are mentioned for `b`, the only specific change is to `b[j]`. The value of `j` is within the range [1, n+1), and `x[j - 1]` is 'S', but these conditions do not affect the value of `b[j]` directly. The initial value of `b[1]` being increased by 1 remains unchanged, and the value of `j` impacts `b[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `x` is the user's input, `j` must be within the range [1, n+1), and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[1]` is increased by 1, `b[j]` is increased by 1**
