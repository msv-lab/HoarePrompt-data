`nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the expression `xx[i][j - 1]` becomes `xx[1][1]`. The value of `nx` is updated accordingly, but the specific value of `xx[1][1]` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[1][1]` to its current value**
