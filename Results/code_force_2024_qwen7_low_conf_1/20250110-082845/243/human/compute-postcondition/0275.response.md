Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. If either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'` and `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.***
