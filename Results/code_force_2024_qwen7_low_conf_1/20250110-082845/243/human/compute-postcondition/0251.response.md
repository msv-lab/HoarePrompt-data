Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `nx` is updated based on the conditions provided.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration (`j = 1`), we know `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 24, and `j` is 1.
   - The value of `nx` was updated based on the conditions given:
     - If `xx[1][0]` is not '?', then `nx` is `nx + val`, where `val` is the value of `xx[1][0]`.
     - If `xx[1][0]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to `2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` should be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `j` is incremented to `2`, the new value of `j` is `2`.
   - `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop over `j`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop over `j`.
   - `nx` will be updated again based on the current values of `i` (which is still 1) and `j` (which is now 2).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `j` is 2) is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
