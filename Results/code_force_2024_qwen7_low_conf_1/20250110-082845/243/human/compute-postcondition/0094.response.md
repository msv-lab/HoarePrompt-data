Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing `[1]`, `sb` is an empty list, `a[i]` is greater than 0, and `b[i]` is equal to 0. If `a[i]` is not greater than 0, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
