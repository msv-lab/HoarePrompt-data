According to the code, the loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state for the next iteration of the loop.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` from 1 to `n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to the current value of `n`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.

Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should be less than or equal to `n`. After the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `n + 1`.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` remains the same as the previous state.
- `b` remains the same as the previous state.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is a list and `b` is a list.**
