The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character `'F'` to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`
- `nx` is either the character `xx[i][j - 1]` (if it is not '?'), or `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `'F'`

Since `nx` is initially either `'S'` or `'F'` based on certain conditions, appending `'F'` to `nx` will change its value. The conditions that determine whether `nx` was `'S'` or `'F'` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new value of `nx` will be:

- If `nx` was originally `'S'`, it becomes `'SF'`.
- If `nx` was originally `'F'`, it becomes `'FF'`.

The states of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, and `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`**
