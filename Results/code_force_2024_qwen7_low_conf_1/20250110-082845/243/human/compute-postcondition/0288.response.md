Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is equal to its previous value plus `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is equal to its previous value plus 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original string appended with 'F'.***
