Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3. If `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[1][1]` to its original value. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is updated by appending `'S'` to its current value. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F'.***
