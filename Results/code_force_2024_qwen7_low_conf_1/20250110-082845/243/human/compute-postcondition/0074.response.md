`a[j]` is assigned the value of `a[j] + 1`. The value at index `i` in list `a` is not directly affected unless `i` equals `j`, but since `i` is not mentioned in the code, only the value at index `j` in list `a` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **the value at index `j` in list `a` is increased by 1**
