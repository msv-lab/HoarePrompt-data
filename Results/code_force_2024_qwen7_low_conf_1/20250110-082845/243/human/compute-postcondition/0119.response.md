The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 3, `sa` will now contain the value 3.

- The initial value of `i` is 3, so `i` remains 3.
- `sa` is initially a list containing the value 2 (based on the precondition that `sa` contains the value 2 if `a[2]` was 0 and `b[2]` was 0, otherwise it remains unchanged), and after appending `i`, `sa` becomes `[2, 3]`.
- The values of `n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, `sa` is `[2, 3]`, `sb` is an empty list, `t` is 1 if `a[2]` was 0 and `b[2]` was 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
