The code snippet `nx += 'S'` adds the string `'S'` to the end of the current value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` could potentially be updated based on certain conditions involving `xx[1][1]`, `i`, and `j`. However, the code does not depend on these conditions and simply appends `'S'` to `nx`.

Therefore, the only change is that `nx` is updated by appending `'S'` to its current value.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `j` is 3; `nx` is the original value of `nx` appended with `'S'`**
