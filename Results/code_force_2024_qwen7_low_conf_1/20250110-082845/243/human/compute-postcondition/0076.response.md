The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `b` by 1. Since the initial state only specifies that the value at index `i` in the list `b` is increased by 1, and does not specify the value of `i` and `j`, we cannot assume they are the same. The value at index `i` was already increased by 1, so it remains unchanged, and now the value at index `j` is also increased by 1.

Output State: **the value at index `i` in the list `b` is increased by 1; the value at index `j` in the list `b` is increased by 1**
