The code `nx += 'F'` appends the string `'F'` to `nx`. Since the initial value of `nx` is not specified, it is safe to assume that it is an empty string or a string without the character `'F'` at the end. Given the initial conditions, the only variable affected by the code is `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'F'**
