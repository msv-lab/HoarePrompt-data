`nx` is a string and is concatenated with the character 'F', so its value changes. The other variables (`j`, `i`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'. Since the initial value of `nx` is a string, it remains a string after concatenation.

Output State: **`nx` is a string that ends with 'F', `j` is `n + 2`, and `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions**
