To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given conditions and requirements step by step.

### Given States:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings
- `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string
- `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to \( n \) that satisfy `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list
- `sb` is an empty list
- `t` is the length of `sa`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the loop will not start executing if `i` is outside this range. Given that `i` is currently set to `n + 1`, the loop condition `i in range(1, n + 1)` will be false initially.

2. **State Adjustments**:
   - To make the loop start executing, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n + 1` but not `n + 1`. Specifically, `i` should be at least `1` but less than `n + 1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to start.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as described, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` that satisfy `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list, `sb` is an empty list, `t` is the length of `sa`**
