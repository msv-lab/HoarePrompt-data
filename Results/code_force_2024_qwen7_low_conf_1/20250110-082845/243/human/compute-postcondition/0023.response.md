Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is 1
   - \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
   - \( j \) is \( n \)
   - If \( x[j - 1] \) is 'F', then \( a[n] \) is incremented by 1.
   - If \( x[j - 1] \) is 'S', then \( b[n] \) is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs from \( j = 1 \) to \( j = n \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j \) is \( n \).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( j \) must be incremented from \( n \) to \( n + 1 \).
   - However, since the loop only runs up to \( n \), once \( j \) reaches \( n + 1 \), the loop condition \( j < n + 1 \) fails, and the loop terminates.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition \( j < n + 1 \) fails when \( j \) becomes \( n + 1 \), the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed in the states \( i \), \( n \), or \( j \).
   - The states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - \( i \) is 1
   - \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
   - \( j \) is \( n \)

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n`**
