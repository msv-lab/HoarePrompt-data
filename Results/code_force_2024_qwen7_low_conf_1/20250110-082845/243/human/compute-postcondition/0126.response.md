`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. The initial state tells us that `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', so `xx[i][j-1]` must be a numeric value. Since the exact value of `xx[i][j-1]` is not specified, we can denote it as `val`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to `nx + val`.

Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices such that `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` is `nx + xx[i][j-1]`**
