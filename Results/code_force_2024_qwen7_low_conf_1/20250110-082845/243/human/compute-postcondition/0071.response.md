Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x, x]`, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, and `x` is a non-empty string. If the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', then `b[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no change is made to `a` and `b`.*
