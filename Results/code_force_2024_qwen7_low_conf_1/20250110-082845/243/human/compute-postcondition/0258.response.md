The code snippet updates `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `j` is 3
- `nx` is updated based on certain conditions

After executing the line `nx += xx[i][j - 1]`, `nx` is incremented by `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, this translates to `nx += xx[1][2]`.

Therefore, the new value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[1][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 3, `nx` is its original value plus `xx[1][2]`**
