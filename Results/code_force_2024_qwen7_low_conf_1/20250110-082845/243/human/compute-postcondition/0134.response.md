Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `xx` is a 2D list.
   - `i` and `j` are indices.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][j-1]`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, or `'S'` otherwise.

2. **Current Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the new state of `j` for the next iteration.
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, at the end of the current iteration, `j` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by `1` from its current value of `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting `i`:**
   - There is no specific condition given for adjusting `i` based on the provided information. Therefore, `i` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjusting `nx`:**
   - The value of `nx` depends on the conditions specified. Since we don't know the exact values of `xx`, `i`, `j`, and `sa`, we can't specify the exact value of `nx`. However, we know that the logic for updating `nx` will be evaluated again when the loop runs.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `nx` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop body.

Therefore, the state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop body.**
