The code snippet `nx += 'F'` updates the value of `nx` by appending the string `'F'` to it. Based on the current state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the changes:

- The previous state was: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined.
- The loop is iterating over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.
- In the previous iteration, `j` was 1, and the condition checked `xx[i][j - 1]` which means `xx[1][0]`.
- Since the exact value of `xx[1][0]` is not specified, we assume it could be anything, but the key point is that the loop continued to the next iteration because `j` was incremented to 2.
- Now, the condition checks `xx[i][j - 1]` again, which means `xx[1][1]`.

Since the exact value of `xx[1][1]` is not specified and the code snippet does not provide a condition to change `nx`, we assume that `nx` was updated in the previous iteration based on the condition `if xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`. However, the new operation is simply appending `'F'` to `nx`.

Thus, the value of `nx` is now whatever it was before plus `'F'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` appended with 'F'.**
