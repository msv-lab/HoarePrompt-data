Postcondition: ***`x` is a list and `b` is a list. If the element at index `j-1` in list `x` is 'F', then the element at index `i` in list `b` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in list `x` is 'S', then the element at index `j` in list `b` is increased by 1, and the element at index `i` in list `b` is also increased by 1. In any case, the element at index `i` in list `b` is increased by 1.***
