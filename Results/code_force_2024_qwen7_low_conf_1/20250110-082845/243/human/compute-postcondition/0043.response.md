Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x]`, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character, and `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character; `x` is an input string, `j` is 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
