Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Determine Necessary Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `j = 1`.
   - For each subsequent iteration, `j` will increment by 1 until `j` reaches `n + 1`, at which point the loop will terminate.

3. **Current State Variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `j` is initially set to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `j` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not execute on the first iteration because `j` must be within the range [1, n] to enter the loop.
   - To make the loop execute at least once, `j` must be within the range [1, n]. Given that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, the smallest value `n` can take is 2, making the initial value of `j` (which is `n + 1`) 3.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

5. **Final Adjusted States**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `n` is still a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive.
   - `j` needs to be set to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - All other variables (`xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `nx`, and the fact that `nx` is printed) do not affect the loop execution directly.

**Conclusion**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1**, and all other variables remain as stated.

This ensures that the loop condition `j in range(1, n + 1)` is met, allowing the loop to execute at least once.
