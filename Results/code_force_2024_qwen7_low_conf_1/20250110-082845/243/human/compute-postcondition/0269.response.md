`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. The initial value of `nx` is an empty string, so `nx` will now be the character `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 1 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
