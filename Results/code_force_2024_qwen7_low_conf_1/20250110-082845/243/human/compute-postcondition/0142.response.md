`nx` is assigned the value `'F'` appended to `nx`. The previous value of `nx` is unknown, but it is updated now. The values of `i`, `j`, and `xx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration; `nx` is now `'F'` concatenated to the previous value of `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 2`, `xx[i][n + 1]` and `xx[i][n]` will be checked in the next iteration; `nx` is `'F'` concatenated to the previous value of `nx`**
