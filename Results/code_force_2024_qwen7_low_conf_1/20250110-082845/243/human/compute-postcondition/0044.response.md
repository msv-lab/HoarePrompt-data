Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive
- `xx` is `[x]`
- `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)):
  - `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character
  - `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character
- `x` is an input string
- `j` is 1
- If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1.
- If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Analysis
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States

1. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue to the next iteration if `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Increment of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

4. **Adjusting Other Variables:**
   - `i` is not affected by the loop and remains 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `xx` remains the same.
   - `a` and `b` may be updated based on the condition `if x[j - 1] == 'F'` or `if x[j - 1] == 'S'`.
     - Since `j` was 1, `x[j - 1]` is `x[0]`. If `x[0]` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1. If `x[0]` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1.
     - For the next iteration, `x[j - 1]` will be `x[1]`. We need to check the value of `x[1]` and update `a` and `b` accordingly.

### Final State Adjustment
At the start of the next iteration (when `j` becomes 2):
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains the same.
- `xx` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` will be updated based on the value of `x[1]`.
- `j` becomes 2.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x]`, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the count of 'F' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character, and `b[k]` is the count of 'S' characters in `x` up to and including the \( k \)-th character; `x` is an input string, `j` is 2. If `x[1]` is 'F', `a[1]` and `a[2]` are incremented by 1. If `x[1]` is 'S', `b[2]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
