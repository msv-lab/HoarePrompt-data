`a[i]` is updated by adding 1 to the existing value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` refers to `a[3]`. Since the initial value of `i` is 3, `a[3]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is `[x, x]`, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `x` is a non-empty string, and the current value of `x[j-1]` is 'F', `a[3]` is increased by 1.**
