The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. Given that `n` is the integer input provided by the user and `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`, the list `a` will have `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer input provided by the user and `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`; `a` is a list with `n + 1` elements, each initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user and `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0.**
