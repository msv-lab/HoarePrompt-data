`nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, we can calculate `xx[i][j - 1]` as `xx[1][2]`. The precondition does not specify the exact content of `xx`, but since the operation is being performed, we can assume `xx[1][2]` exists. The previous value of `nx` is `nx + 'S'`, so after the operation, `nx` will be `nx + 'S' + xx[1][2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is `nx + 'S' + xx[1][2]`**
