The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string stored in `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string `""`. After appending 'S', `nx` becomes "S". The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is "S", `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
