Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `j` is 2 (since we're starting the new iteration, `j` will be 2)
   - `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings
   - `a` and `b` are lists as defined
   - `sa` is a list as defined
   - `sb` is a list as defined
   - `nx` is updated based on specific rules.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

   - The loop starts with `j = 2`.
   - We need to determine how `nx` changes and what other states might be affected based on the loop's execution.

4. **Rule for Updating `nx`:**
   - If `xx[1][1]` is not `?`, then `nx` is `nx_initial + xx[1][1]`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` concatenated with `'S'` if `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`. Otherwise, `nx` is the previous value of `nx` appended with `'F'`.

5. **Given Values:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, and `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` (since `j` is 2, it could be in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements).

6. **Update `nx`:**
   - Since `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb` and `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, `nx` will be updated by concatenating `'S'` to the previous value of `nx`.

7. **Other States:**
   - `i` remains 1 since the loop incrementing `j` does not affect `i`.
   - `j` is incremented to 3 in this iteration.
   - `xx` remains unchanged.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `sa` remains unchanged.
   - `sb` remains unchanged.

8. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - `nx` is updated by concatenating `'S'` to the previous value of `nx`.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `n` must be at least 1
- `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings
- `a` and `b` are lists as defined
- `sa` is a list as defined
- `sb` is a list as defined
- `nx` is updated to include `'S'` based on the conditions (previous value of `nx` + `'S'`).

**Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is updated to include `'S'` based on the conditions (previous value of `nx` + `'S'`)**
