The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given that the initial value of `nx` is updated to include `'S'` based on the conditions (previous value of `nx` + `'S'`), and now we are appending 'F' to `nx`, the new value of `nx` will be the previous value plus 'SF'.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is updated to include `'SF'`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is updated to include `'SF'`**
