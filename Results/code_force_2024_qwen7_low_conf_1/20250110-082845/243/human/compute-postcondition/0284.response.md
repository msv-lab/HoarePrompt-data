`nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `j` are such that `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`. The value of `nx` is updated based on the specified addition.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is equal to its previous value plus `xx[i][j - 1]`**
