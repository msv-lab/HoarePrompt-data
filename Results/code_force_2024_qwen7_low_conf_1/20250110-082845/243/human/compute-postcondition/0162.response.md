`nx` is an empty string (`""`), `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`. The code appends the string `'F'` to `nx`. Therefore, `nx` will become `"F"`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is `"F"`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is `n + 1`**
