The code `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, or the string `nx` which was previously defined and printed. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is an empty string**
