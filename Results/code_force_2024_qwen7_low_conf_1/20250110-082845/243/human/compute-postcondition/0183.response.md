`nx` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with 'S'. The previous value of `nx` is an empty string, so after adding 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. The conditions about `i`, `j`, and `sa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?' and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
