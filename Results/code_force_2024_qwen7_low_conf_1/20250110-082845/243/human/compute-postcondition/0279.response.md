The variable `nx` is assigned a new value by concatenating `'S'` to its current value. Since the initial value of `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1]` (if it is not '?'), `'S'` if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, or `'F'` otherwise, the new value of `nx` will be the concatenation of its original value and `'S'`. 

- If `nx` was originally `'S'`, then after the operation, `nx` becomes `'SS'`.
- If `nx` was originally `'F'`, then after the operation, `nx` becomes `'FS'`.
- If `nx` was originally `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then after the operation, `nx` becomes `xx[i][j - 1]'S'`.

The states of `i`, `j`, `xx`, `n`, and `sb` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 2 but less than `n + 1`, and `nx` is either `xx[i][j - 1]'S'` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'), `'SS'` (if `nx` was originally `'S'`), or `'FS'` (if `nx` was originally `'F'`).**
