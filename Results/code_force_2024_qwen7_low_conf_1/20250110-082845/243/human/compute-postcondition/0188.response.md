`nx` is a string, and its value is appended with the character 'F'. The value of `j` is `n + 1`, and the values of `i` and `n` remain consistent with their preconditions. Therefore, the updated state is that `nx` now includes the character 'F' at the end.

Output State: **`nx` is a string ending with 'F', `j` is `n + 1`, `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions**
