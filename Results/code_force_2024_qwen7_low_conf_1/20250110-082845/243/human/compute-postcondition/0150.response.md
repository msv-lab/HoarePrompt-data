State before the loop starts: `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in range(1, n + 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
2. **Initialization**: The variable `i` is given as `n + 1`, which means `i` is set to `n + 1` before the loop starts.
3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given this information:
- `nx` being an empty string does not affect the loop execution.
- `i` is already set to `n + 1`, so it doesn't need adjustment since the loop will only start if `n` is positive.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
