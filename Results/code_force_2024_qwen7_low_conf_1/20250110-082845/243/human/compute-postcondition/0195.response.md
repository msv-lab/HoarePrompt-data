The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Given that `nx` is initially a string, appending 'S' to it will create a new string with 'S' added to the end. The other variables `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is "a string S", `j` is `n + 2`, `i` and `n` are consistent with their preconditions**
