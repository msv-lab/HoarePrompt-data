`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus the string `'S'`. However, the initial value of `nx` is not specified in the initial state, only the values of `i` and `j` are mentioned. Since `nx` is updated by adding the string `'S'` to its current value, the new value of `nx` depends on its initial value, which is not provided. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is its initial value plus `'S'`**
