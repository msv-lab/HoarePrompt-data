The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` and `i`, we cannot provide specific values for `a[i]`. We know that the value at index `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **the value at index `i` in list `a` is increased by 1**
