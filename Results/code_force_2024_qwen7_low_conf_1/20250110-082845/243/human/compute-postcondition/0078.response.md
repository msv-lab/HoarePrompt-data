Postcondition: ***`x` is a list and `b` is a list. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'F', then the value at index `j` in `a` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j - 1` in `x` is 'S', then the value at index `i` in `b` is increased by 1 and the value at index `j` in `b` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values in `b` remain unchanged.***
