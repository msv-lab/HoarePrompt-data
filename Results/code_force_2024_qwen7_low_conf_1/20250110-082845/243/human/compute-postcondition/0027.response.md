The code snippet increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `b[n]` is increased by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `b[1]`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is `n`, `b[1]` is increased by 1, `b[n]` is increased by 1**
