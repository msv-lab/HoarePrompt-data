The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `nx`, we only know that it is a string. After executing the code, `nx` will be the original string plus 'F'.

The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is at least 3 but less than `n + 1`, `nx` is the original string appended with 'F'.**
