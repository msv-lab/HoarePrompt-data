The code snippet updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. However, the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `nx` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. We know that `j` is `n + 1`, but without knowing the specific values of `i`, `nx`, and `xx`, we can only express the updated value of `nx`.

Output State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is updated to `nx + xx[i][n]`**
