`a[j]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is unknown, but it specifies the index in list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list and `b` is a list; the element at index `j` in list `a` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`x` is a list and `b` is a list; the element at index `j` in list `a` is incremented by 1.**
