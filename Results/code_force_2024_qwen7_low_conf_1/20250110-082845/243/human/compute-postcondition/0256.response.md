Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[1][1]` to its current value; otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'**.
