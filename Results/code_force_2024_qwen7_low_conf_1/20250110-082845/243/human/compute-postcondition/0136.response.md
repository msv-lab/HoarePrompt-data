`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'F'`. The initial value of `nx` is not specified, but since it is mentioned that `nx` will be updated based on the conditions in the loop body, we assume it was updated in some way before this line of code. However, since no specific conditions or initial value for `nx` is given in the example, we consider the simplest case where `nx` was already defined. After adding `'F'` to `nx`, the new value of `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with `'F'`.

Output State: **`i` is unchanged, `j` is `n + 1`, `nx` is the original value of `nx` concatenated with `'F'`**
