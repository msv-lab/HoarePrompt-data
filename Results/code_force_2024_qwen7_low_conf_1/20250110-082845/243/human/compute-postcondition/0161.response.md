`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. The initial state shows that `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` and `j` are both greater than 1. However, the exact value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified. The only thing we know is that `nx` is initially an empty string.

Therefore, the updated value of `nx` will be an empty string concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`, which is just `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0.**
