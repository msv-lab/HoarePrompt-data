`j` is assigned the value of `n`. The code then increments `a[j]` by 1. Since `j` is equal to `n`, `a[n]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `j` is `n`; `a[n]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive; `j` is `n`; `a[n]` is incremented by 1.**
