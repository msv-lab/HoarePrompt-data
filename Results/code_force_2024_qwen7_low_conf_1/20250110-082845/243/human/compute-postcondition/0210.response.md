The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `sb`. The initial state is given as follows: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `a[k] > 0` and `b[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list; `sb` is `[1]`.

After executing the code `sb.append(i)`, the list `sb` will contain the value 1 and 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists where for each index \( k \) (1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ \( n \)), `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string, and `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' characters in all the strings up to and including the \( k \)-th string; `sa` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` if there exists at least one index \( k \) such that `a[k] > 0` and `b[k] == 0`, otherwise it is an empty list; `sb` is `[1, 3]`**.
