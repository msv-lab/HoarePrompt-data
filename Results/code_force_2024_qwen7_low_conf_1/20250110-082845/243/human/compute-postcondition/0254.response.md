The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nx`, it is treated as an empty string for this calculation. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'F'**
