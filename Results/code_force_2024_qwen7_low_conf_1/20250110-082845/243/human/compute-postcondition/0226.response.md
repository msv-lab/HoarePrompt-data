The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Here are the steps to determine the updated state:

1. **Identify the Current Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `nx` is currently an undefined value before the addition (let's denote its initial value as `nx_initial`).

2. **Determine the Value of `xx[i][j - 1]`:**
   - Given `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, we need to find the value of `xx[1][1]`.

3. **Update `nx`:**
   - `nx` is updated to `nx_initial + xx[1][1]`.

Since the initial value of `nx` (`nx_initial`) is not specified, we will represent it as such. However, the critical update is the addition of `xx[1][1]` to `nx`.

**Output State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `j` is now 2.
- `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings.
- `a` and `b` are lists as defined.
- `sa` is a list as defined.
- `sb` is a list as defined.
- `nx` is updated to `nx_initial + xx[1][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings, `a` and `b` are lists as defined, `sa` is a list as defined, `sb` is a list as defined, `nx` is `nx_initial + xx[1][1]`.**
