Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 24 inclusive, `j` is 1, `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `xx[1][0]` is not '?', then `nx` is `nx + val`, where `val` is the value of `xx[1][0]`.
- If `xx[1][0]` is '?', then `nx` is 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.**
