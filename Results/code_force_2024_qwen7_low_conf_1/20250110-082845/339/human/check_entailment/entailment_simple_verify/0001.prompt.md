You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n monsters standing in a row. The i -th monster has a_i health
points.

Every second, you can choose one alive monster and launch a chain lightning at
it. The lightning deals k damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards
decreasing i ) and to the right (towards increasing i ) to alive monsters,
dealing k damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the
beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its
health points are strictly greater than 0 .

For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with
health equal to [5, 2, 7] , and k = 3 . You can kill them all in 4 seconds:

  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [2, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 1 -st monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 1] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -th monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, -2] . 

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , calculate the minimum number
of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5 ) — the number of
monsters.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^5 )
— the health points of the i -th monster.

Output

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , output the minimum number of
seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's break down the given program to understand how it works and whether it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of monsters `N` and their health points `a`.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the monsters by their health points.
3. **Bit Array Initialization**: It initializes a bit array `bits` to keep track of which positions are occupied and an array `wtr` to store indices.
4. **Building the Bit Array**: For each monster, it updates the bit array based on the current monster's health points.
5. **Calculating Minimum Seconds**: For each value of `k` from 1 to `m`, it calculates the minimum number of seconds required to kill all monsters using the precomputed bit array.

The program seems to follow a method to calculate the minimum time to kill all monsters for each possible `k`. However, let's verify if the logic and implementation are correct:

- The sorting step ensures that we process the monsters with the least health points first, which aligns with the problem's requirement to minimize the number of seconds.
- The bit array `bits` is used to mark the positions where monsters are present, and this is correctly updated for each monster.
- The main loop iterates over each possible `k` and uses the bit array to compute the minimum time. This approach seems logically sound, as it considers the effect of chain lightning spreading to both sides.

Given the explanation and the structure of the code, the program appears to be designed to solve the problem correctly.
