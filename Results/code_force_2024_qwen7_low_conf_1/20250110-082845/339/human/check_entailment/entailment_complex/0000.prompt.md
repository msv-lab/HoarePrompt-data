You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n monsters standing in a row. The i -th monster has a_i health
points.

Every second, you can choose one alive monster and launch a chain lightning at
it. The lightning deals k damage to it, and also spreads to the left (towards
decreasing i ) and to the right (towards increasing i ) to alive monsters,
dealing k damage to each. When the lightning reaches a dead monster or the
beginning/end of the row, it stops. A monster is considered alive if its
health points are strictly greater than 0 .

For example, consider the following scenario: there are three monsters with
health equal to [5, 2, 7] , and k = 3 . You can kill them all in 4 seconds:

  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [2, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 1 -st monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 4] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -rd monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, 1] ; 
  * launch a chain lightning at the 3 -th monster, then their health values are [-1, -1, -2] . 

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , calculate the minimum number
of seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5 ) — the number of
monsters.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^5 )
— the health points of the i -th monster.

Output

For each k from 1 to \max(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) , output the minimum number of
seconds it takes to kill all the monsters.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and performs the following operations:
1. It reads the integer `N` and the list `a` from standard input.
2. It constructs a list `b` of tuples containing each index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`.
3. It sorts the list `b` based on the values of `a`.
4. It determines the maximum value `m` in the list `a`.
5. It initializes a bit array `bits` and a list `wtr` of empty lists.
6. It iterates through the sorted list `S` and updates the bit array `bits` and another list `f` based on the differences between consecutive elements.
7. It prints the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `f` for each divisor of the maximum value `m`.
