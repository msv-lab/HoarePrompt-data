Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the calculation of the minimum number of seconds needed to kill all monsters for each value of `k`. The logic used in the program does not accurately simulate the spread of the chain lightning and the reduction of monster health over time.

One issue is that the program does not correctly update the `bits` array to reflect the spread of the chain lightning. The `bits` array is initialized incorrectly and the logic for updating it does not account for the proper spread of damage to adjacent monsters. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a monster is killed by the chain lightning but the lightning still spreads further to other monsters.

To demonstrate this, consider the following input:
```
3
5 2 7
```

The expected output should be:
```
10 6 4 3 2 2 1
```

However, running the provided program with this input will produce incorrect results due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
