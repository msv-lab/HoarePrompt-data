Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is `[2]`
   - `operations` is `2`
   - `k` is `max_health + 1`
   - `current_health[0]` is 0 or less
   - `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - 2 * (max_health + 1)`
   - `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`
   - `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Criteria:**
   The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1` (since `i` starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1`).

6. **Next Iteration Adjustment:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be `n` (since `i` will increment from `n-1` to `n`).
   - Therefore, `i` must be `n`.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`results`, `operations`, `k`, `current_health`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself but might be modified within the loop body, which we are not considering here.

8. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be `n`
   - The other variables retain their values from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - 2 * (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`, `i` is `n`**.
