Output State: **`results` is a list containing the final value of `operations`, `operations` is the total number of times the loop executed, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a list where each element is reduced by a multiple of `k` based on the operations performed, `current_health[i]` is less than or equal to 0 for all valid `i` (0 ≤ i < n), and `n` is the number of elements in the `current_health` list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs as long as there exists at least one element in `current_health` that is greater than 0. This means the loop continues to execute until all elements in `current_health` are less than or equal to 0.
2. **Operations Counter**: Each time an element in `current_health` is decremented by `k`, `operations` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `operations` will be the total number of such decrements.
3. **Effect on `current_health`**: For each valid index `i` (0 ≤ i < n), the value of `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k` if the condition `current_health[i] > 0` holds. Additionally, adjacent elements are also decremented by `k` if they exist.
4. **Final State**: After the loop terminates, all elements in `current_health` will be less than or equal to 0 because the loop ensures that every positive element will eventually be reduced to 0 or less. The value of `operations` will reflect the total number of decrement operations performed.
5. **Initial Values**: The initial values of `results`, `operations`, `k`, and `current_health` are preserved in the final state since these do not change within the loop.

This final state ensures that all conditions and transformations described in the loop code are correctly reflected.
