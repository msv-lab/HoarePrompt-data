`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. This operation affects the `current_health` list at index `i`. Given that `current_health[i]` was a copy of `health[i]`, it now decreases by `k`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1`, `current_health[i + 1]` also decreases by `k`.

- `operations` is incremented by 1 to `operations + 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 to `i + 1`.
- `current_health[i]` (which is the same as `current_health[i + 1 - 1]`) is decreased by `k`.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `operations` is `operations + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`.
- If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is also decreased by `k`.

Output State: **`current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`; `operations` is `operations + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`.**
