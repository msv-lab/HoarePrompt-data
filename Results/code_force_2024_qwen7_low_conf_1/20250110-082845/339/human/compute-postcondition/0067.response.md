The code `current_health = health[:]` creates a shallow copy of the `health` list and assigns it to `current_health`. The original `health` list remains unchanged. The `results` list and the value of `operations` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is its value or object, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health`**
