The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` decreases the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by `k`. The previous state was that `current_health[i - 1]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is `operations + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`.

Since the condition `if i < n - 1` is already checked and the code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` is being executed, it means `i` is indeed less than `n - 1`. Thus, `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`. 

The updated states are:
- `current_health[i - 1]` is decreased by `k`
- `operations` is `operations + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`

Output State: **`current_health[i - 1]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is `operations + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`**
