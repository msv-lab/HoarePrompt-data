Postcondition: **`current_health` is a copy of `health`, `operations` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is also decreased by `k`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, the conditions remain as per the precondition.**
