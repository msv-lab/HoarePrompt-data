According to the given code, the loop condition depends on the variables `e` and `num - last`. The loop will continue as long as `e` is less than `num - last`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `total` is 0
- `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\)
- `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\)
- `ans` is an empty list
- `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`
- `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`
- `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`
- `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists
- `f` is `[1, 1]`
- `g` is 1
- `last` is 1
- `num` must be greater than 0

The loop will execute as long as `e < num - last`. Since `last` is 1, the loop condition simplifies to `e < num - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `e` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should become `e + 1`, which means `e` should be 1 (assuming `e` starts from 0).

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `total` remains 0
- `N` remains an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\)
- `a` remains a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\)
- `ans` remains an empty list
- `b` remains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`
- `S` remains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`
- `m` remains the maximum value in the list `a`
- `bits` remains a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`
- `wtr` remains a list of `N` empty lists
- `f` remains `[1, 1]`
- `g` remains 1
- `last` remains 1
- `num` must remain greater than 0
- `e` must be 1
