Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the required states at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\)
   - `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\)
   - `ans` is an empty list
   - `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`
   - `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 1` tuples)
   - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`
   - `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with one of the `1`s changed to `0` at index `i + 1`
   - `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists
   - `f` is a list of `N + 1` ones with the last element replaced by `g`, where `g` is either 0, 1, or 2
   - `last` is a known integer
   - `num` is a known integer such that `num - last >= 1`
   - `e` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over the range `range(num - last)`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `e` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be less than `num - last`.
   - Since the loop increments `e` by 1 in each iteration, `e` becomes 1 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - `e` must be incremented to 1.
   - No other state changes are necessary based on the provided information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: `total` is 0, `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 1` tuples), `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with one of the `1`s changed to `0` at index `i + 1`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 1` ones with the last element replaced by `g`, where `g` is either 0, 1, or 2, `last` is a known integer, `num` is a known integer such that `num - last >= 1`, and `e` is 1.**
