Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or remains as its original value, and if `i < n - 1`, then `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1)`.***
