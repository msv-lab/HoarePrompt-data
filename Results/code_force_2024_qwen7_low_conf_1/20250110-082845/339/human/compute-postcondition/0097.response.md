`results` is a list containing the final value of `operations`, which is the total number of times the loop executed, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a list where each element is reduced by a multiple of `k` based on the operations performed, and `current_health[i]` is less than or equal to 0 for all valid `i` (0 ≤ i < n). The code appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the final value of `operations` plus the new value of `operations`, `operations` is the total number of times the loop executed, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a list where each element is reduced by a multiple of `k` based on the operations performed, and `current_health[i]` is less than or equal to 0 for all valid `i` (0 ≤ i < n)**.
