`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. Given that `k` is `max_health + 1` and `current_health[i]` is greater than 0, `current_health[i]` will be decreased by `max_health + 1`. Since `max_health + 1` is more than any positive value of `current_health[i]`, `current_health[i]` will become 0 or less (specifically, it will become `-1` because it starts as a positive value and is reduced by `max_health + 1`). The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[i]` being 0 or less, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.**
