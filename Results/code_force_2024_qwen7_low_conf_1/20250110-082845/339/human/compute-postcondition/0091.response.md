`current_health[i - 1]` is assigned the value of itself minus `k`. The value of `i` is `n`, and `current_health[i]` is reduced by `k`. Therefore, `current_health[i - 1]` will be the original value of `current_health[i - 1]` minus `k`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `operations` is its original value + 1; `current_health[i - 1]` is reduced by `k`**
