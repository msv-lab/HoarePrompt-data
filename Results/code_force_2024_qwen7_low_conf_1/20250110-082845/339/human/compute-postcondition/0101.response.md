Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and `health`, a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster. It returns a list `results` containing the total number of operations performed for each value of `k` from 1 to `max_health`, where `max_health` is the maximum value in the `health` list. For each `k` from 1 to `max_health`, the function simulates performing an operation that decreases the health of each monster by `k` and also decreases the health of adjacent monsters by `k`. The function counts the total number of such operations performed for each `k` and stores these counts in the `results` list.**

This summary includes the following:
- The function accepts `n` (number of monsters) and `health` (health points of each monster).
- It calculates `max_health`, which is the maximum value in the `health` list.
- For each `k` from 1 to `max_health`, it creates a copy of the `health` list (`current_health`), simulates operations, and counts the number of operations performed.
- The function returns a list `results` containing the count of operations for each `k`.
