Postcondition: ***`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, and `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)` if `i > 0`. Otherwise, the same as the precondition.***
