Based on the provided information, let's analyze the state and the loop condition step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `range(num - last)`. For this loop to execute, the expression `num - last` must be a positive integer. This means that `num` must be greater than `last`.

2. **Variables Involved**: The variables directly involved in the loop condition are `num` and `last`.

3. **Initialization and State**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\).
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`.
   - `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`.
   - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`.
   - `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists.
   - `f` is an empty list.
   - `g` is 1.
   - `last` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `last` is initially 0, the value of `num` must be greater than `last` for the loop to execute. Therefore, `num` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `num` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is an empty list, `g` is 1, `last` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0.
