Postcondition: ***`current_health` is a copy of `health`, `operations` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `current_health[i] > 0`, then `current_health[i - 1]` is decreased by `k` and `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k` if `i < n - 1`. If `current_health[i] <= 0`, no further changes occur.***
