The code snippet `b = [(i, a[i]) for i in range(len(a))]` creates a new list `b` where each element is a tuple consisting of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]` from the list `a`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\);
- `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\);
- `ans` is an empty list.

The code impacts the following:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The list `ans` remains an empty list.
- A new list `b` is created with elements as tuples `(i, a[i])` for each index `i` in the range of the length of `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\); `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`.**
