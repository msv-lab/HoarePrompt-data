Postcondition: ***`current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is also decreased by `k`, `operations` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, the conditions remain as per the precondition (i.e., `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`, `operations` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1).***
