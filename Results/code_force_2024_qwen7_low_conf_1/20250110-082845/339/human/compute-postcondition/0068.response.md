The variable `operations` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`results`, `k`, `current_health`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 0, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health`**
