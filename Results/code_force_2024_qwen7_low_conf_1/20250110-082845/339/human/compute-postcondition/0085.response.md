The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` means that the value of `current_health[i + 1]` will be decreased by `k`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is 3 and `k` is `max_health + 1`. Therefore, `current_health[i + 1]` is `current_health[4]`, and it will be decreased by `max_health + 1`.

Let's break down the changes:

- Initially, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less.
- Initially, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`.
- Initially, `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)` if `i > 0`. Since `i` is 3, which is greater than 0, this condition applies.
- Initially, `current_health[4]` is unspecified.

After the operation, `current_health[4]` will be updated to `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`.

The output state will be:
- `results` is [2]
- `operations` is 2
- `k` is `max_health + 1`
- `current_health[0]` is 0 or less
- `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`
- `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`
- `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`

Output State: **`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`**
