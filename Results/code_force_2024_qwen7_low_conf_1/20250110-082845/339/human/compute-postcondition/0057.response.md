The code snippet `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Given the initial state:
- `current_health` is a copy of `health`.
- `operations` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`.
- If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is also decreased by `k`.

After executing the code snippet `operations += 1`:
- `operations` is incremented by 1, so it is now `operations + 1`.
- All other variables (`current_health`, `i`, and `current_health[i]` and `current_health[i + 1]` if applicable) remain in their previous states.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`current_health` is a copy of `health`, `operations` is incremented by 1 to `operations + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`.**
