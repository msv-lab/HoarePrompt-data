The code sorts the list `b` based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., `a[i]`) in ascending order. This means that the list `b` is rearranged such that the tuples are ordered by the values in `a`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial list `b` is a list of tuples `(i, a[i])` for each index `i` in the range of the length of `a`.
2. After sorting `b` using `S = sorted(b, key=lambda x: x[1])`, the list `S` contains the same tuples as `b`, but sorted by the second element of each tuple (i.e., `a[i]`).

The output state is:
**`N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\); `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\); `ans` is an empty list; `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`; `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`.**
