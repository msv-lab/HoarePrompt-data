The code `current_health[i - 1] -= k` impacts the `current_health` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `k` is `max_health + 1`. Therefore, `current_health[3 - 1]` which is `current_health[2]` is decremented by `max_health + 1`.

From the initial state, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1)`, which means `current_health[3]` is already decreased by `max_health + 1`. Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2, and `current_health[2]` is being updated.

Thus, `current_health[2]` is decreased by `max_health + 1`.

Output State: **`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3; `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)**
