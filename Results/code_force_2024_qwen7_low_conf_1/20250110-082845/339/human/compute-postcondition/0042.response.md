The code snippet `bits[i + 1] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the element at index `i + 1` in the list `bits`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `bits` or the value of `i`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact state of the elements in `bits` before this assignment. The only thing we know is that the element at index `i + 1` in `bits` is now `0`.

The states of the variables `last` and `num` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`last` is equal to `num`, `num` retains its original value, `bits[i + 1]` is 0**
