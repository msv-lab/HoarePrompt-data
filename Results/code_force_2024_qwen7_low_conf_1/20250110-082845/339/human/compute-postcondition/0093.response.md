The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` subtracts `k` from the value of `current_health[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, the value of `current_health[i]` is reduced by `k` as per the initial conditions. The value of `current_health[i + 1]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value. The values of `i`, `operations`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `current_health[i]` is reduced by `k`.
- `current_health[i + 1]` is reduced by `k`.
- `i` remains the same.
- `operations` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `operations` is its original value + 1, `current_health[i]` is reduced by `k`, and `current_health[i + 1]` is reduced by `k`.**
