`operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `k` remains unchanged, `current_health` remains a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` remains 3. The condition `if i < n - 1` is not relevant here since `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0, but this does not affect the value of `current_health[3]`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
