`N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `N` is an integer input by the user. The value of `a` remains unchanged as no code directly affects it. The precondition that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` is now applied to `N`, meaning `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to 10^5 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
