Postcondition: ***`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - 2 * (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`. These conditions hold regardless of whether `i < n - 1` or `i >= n - 1`.***
