The code `results.append(operations)` appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values for `results` or `operations`, we will keep them in their general form.

- `results` is a list (if not already defined, it will be created).
- `operations` is a variable that holds some value or object.

After executing the line of code, `operations` is added to the list `results`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is its value or object**
