The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` updates the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by subtracting `k` from it. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2 and `i < n - 1`. Since `i < n - 1` is true, `i + 1` is a valid index in the `current_health` list. Also, `k` is `max_health + 1`.

Therefore, `current_health[3]` (since `i + 1` would be `2 + 1` which is `3`) is updated to `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1)`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1)`, and `i < n - 1`**
