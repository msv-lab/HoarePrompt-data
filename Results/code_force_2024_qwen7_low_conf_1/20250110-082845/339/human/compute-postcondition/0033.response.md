Let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `total` is 0
  - `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\)
  - `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\)
  - `ans` is an empty list
  - `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`
  - `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 1` tuples)
  - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`
  - `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with the value at index `i + 1` changed to `0`
  - `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists
  - `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`
  - `g` is either 0, 1, or 2
  - `last` is `num`
  - `num` is a known integer such that `num - last >= 1`
  - `e` is `num - last`
  - `g` is updated by the expression `g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for (i, num) in S:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is the index from the list `S`, which is derived from sorting the list `a` in ascending order. Since `S` is a list of tuples `(i, num)` where `num = a[i]` and sorted in ascending order, the index `i` increases with each iteration of the loop.

2. **Variable `num`:** This is the value at index `i` in the original list `a`.

3. **List `S`:** Initially, it contains `N` tuples. After each iteration, one tuple is removed (since `S` is reduced by one tuple per iteration). Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `S` has `N - 1` tuples.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `S`. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `S` must still contain at least one tuple.

### Step-by-step Adjustment:

1. **Determine the current state of `i` and `num`:**
   - Since `S` initially had `N` tuples and we have removed one tuple per iteration, `S` now has `N - 1` tuples.
   - Let `i` be the index of the current tuple in `S` (the index of the last tuple in `S`).

2. **Update `i` and `num`:**
   - `i` is the index of the current tuple in `S`.
   - `num` is the value at index `i` in the original list `a`.

3. **Adjust other states:**
   - `S` should now have one fewer tuple than before, i.e., `N - 2` tuples if this is the second iteration, or `N - 1` tuples if this is the first iteration.

### Final State:

State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 2` tuples), `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with the value at index `i + 1` changed to `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`, `g` is either 0, 1, or 2, `last` is `num`, `num` is a known integer such that `num - last >= 1`, `e` is `num - last`, `g` is updated by the expression `g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**

This adjustment ensures that the loop can continue to the next iteration if `S` still contains at least one tuple.
