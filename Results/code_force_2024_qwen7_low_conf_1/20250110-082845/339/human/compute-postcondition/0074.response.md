`current_health[i - 1]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value. Given that `i` is 1, `current_health[i - 1]` is the same as `current_health[0]`. The initial value of `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, and `k` is `max_health + 1`. Since `current_health[0]` is already 0 or less, subtracting a positive value (`k`) from it will keep it as a non-positive number (either 0 or a negative number).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
