Postcondition: ***`results` is [2], `operations` is 2, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health[0]` is 0 or less, `current_health[3]` is `current_health[3] - (max_health + 1) - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[2]` is `current_health[2] - (max_health + 1)`, `current_health[4]` is `current_health[4] - (max_health + 1)`. If `i < n - 1`, then all these conditions hold. Since there is no else part, these conditions also hold when `i >= n - 1`.***
