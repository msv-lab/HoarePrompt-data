Let's analyze the given code step by step:

- The code snippet is: `print(sum([f[d * x] for x in range(1 + (m - 1) // d)]), end=' ')`

- The value of `d` is `m + 1`.
- The value of `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- The list `f` has `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`.

Now, let's break down the expression inside the `sum` function:
- `d * x` for `x` in the range `range(1 + (m - 1) // d)`.

Since `d = m + 1` and `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, we know:
- `(m - 1) // d` simplifies to `0` because `m - 1 < m + 1`.

So, the range `range(1 + (m - 1) // d)` becomes `range(1)`, which means the loop iterates only once.

For `x = 0` (the only value in the range):
- `d * x = (m + 1) * 0 = 0`.
- The value `f[0]` is `1` (since `f` starts with `1`s).

Therefore, the sum inside the `print` function evaluates to `1`.

The output of the print statement is `1`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with all elements except the first and the last set to `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`, `g` is either 0, 1, or 2, `last` is `m`, and `d` is now `m + 1`. The value printed is `1`.**
