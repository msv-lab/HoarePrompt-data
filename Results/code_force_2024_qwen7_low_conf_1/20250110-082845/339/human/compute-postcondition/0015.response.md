The code `f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. The initial state of `f` is `[1]`, and the value of `g` is 1. After appending `g` to `f`, the list `f` becomes `[1, 1]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is `[1, 1]`, `g` is 1, `last` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0.**
