`operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `operations` and maintains the original values of the other variables.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop, and the current value of `current_health[i]` is greater than 0**
