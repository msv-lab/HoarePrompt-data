The code updates the variable `g` by adding the values of `bits[i]`, `bits[i + 2]`, and subtracting 1. The initial state does not provide specific values for `bits[i]` and `bits[i + 2]`, so they remain as `bits[i]` and `bits[i + 2]`. The value of `g` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`last` is equal to `num`, `num` retains its original value, `bits[i + 1]` is 0, `g` is updated to `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**
