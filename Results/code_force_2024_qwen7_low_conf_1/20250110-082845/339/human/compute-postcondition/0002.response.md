The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This means that the existing value of `N` (which was previously set to an input integer between 1 and \(10^5\)) is no longer directly relevant to the current state of `a`, since `a` now contains the actual list of integers read from the input.

Given this, the output state will reflect the following:

- `N` remains as the input integer (though its exact value is not specified).
- `a` is updated to contain the list of integers read from the input.
- `ans` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\); `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list.**
