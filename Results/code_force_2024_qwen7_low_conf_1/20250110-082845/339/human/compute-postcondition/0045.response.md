Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `d` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. This means the loop will run as long as `d` is less than or equal to `m`.

2. **Initial Values and Conditions**:
   - `m` is defined as the maximum value in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop will run until `d` is equal to `m`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `d` must be at least 1.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `d` must start from 1 and the loop condition is `d <= m`, we need to ensure that `d` starts from 1 and `m` is at least 1 (though `m` is already defined as the maximum value in `a`, which is guaranteed to be at least 1).
   - No other initial values or states in the provided information need adjustment because they are not directly involved in the loop condition.

### Conclusion:

The only necessary adjustments are to ensure that `d` starts from 1. Given that `d` starts from 1 in the loop range, we don't need to explicitly set `d` initially. However, for clarity and completeness in the loop setup, we can state that `d` is 1 at the start of the loop.

### Final Answer:

State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with all elements except the first and the last set to `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`, `g` is either 0, 1, or 2, `last` is `m`, and `d` is 1**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial state.
