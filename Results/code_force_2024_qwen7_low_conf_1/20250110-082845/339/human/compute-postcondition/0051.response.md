Output State: **`total` is 0, `a` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with all elements except the first and the last set to `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g`, `g` is either 0, 1, or 2, `last` is `m`, and the printed value for each iteration `i` is the sum of the elements in `f` at indices from `d*i` to `(d-1)*(i+1)` inclusive.**
