`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. The value of `i` is `n`, and the value of `operations` is its original value plus 1. Therefore, `i` remains `n`, but `current_health[i]` is updated by subtracting `k`. The `operations` variable is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `n`; `operations` is its original value + 1; `current_health[i]` is reduced by `k`**
