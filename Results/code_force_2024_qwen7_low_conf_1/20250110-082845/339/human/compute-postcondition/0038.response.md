Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\)
   - `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\)
   - `ans` is an empty list
   - `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`
   - `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 2` tuples)
   - `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`
   - `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with the value at index `i + 1` changed to `0`
   - `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists
   - `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g` which is either `-1` or `0`
   - `g` is the value of `bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`
   - `last` is `num`
   - `num - last >= 1`
   - `e` is now `num - last - 2` and must be greater than 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `e` in the range `num - last`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the last iteration, `e` is `num - last - 2` and it must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `e` must decrease by 1, making it `num - last - 3`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `S` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `bits` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `wtr` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `f` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `g` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `last` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop condition.
   - `num` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop condition.
   - `e` decreases by 1, so it becomes `num - last - 3` and must still be greater than 0.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `N` is an integer equal to the input value within the range 1 to \(10^5\), `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^5\), `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, `S` is a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and the corresponding value `a[i]`, sorted in ascending order by the value `a[i]`, and one fewer tuple than before (i.e., `N - 2` tuples), `m` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N + 2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements set to `1`, and ending with `0`, with the value at index `i + 1` changed to `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list of `N + 2` elements, with the first `N + 1` elements being ones and the last element being `g` which is either `-1` or `0`, `g` is the value of `bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`, `last` is `num`, `num - last >= 1`, and `e` is now `num - last - 3` and must be greater than 0.**
