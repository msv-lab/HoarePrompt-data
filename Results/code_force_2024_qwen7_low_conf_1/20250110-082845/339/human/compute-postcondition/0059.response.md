The code updates `current_health[i - 1]` by subtracting `k` from its current value. The other changes in the initial state (like `operations += 1`, `i += 1`, and the condition for `current_health[i + 1]`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `current_health[i]` is decreased by `k`
- `operations` is `operations + 1`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`

After executing the line `current_health[i - 1] -= k`, the following changes occur:
- `current_health[i - 1]` is updated by subtracting `k` from its current value.
- `operations` is increased by 1.
- `i` is increased by 1.
- If `i` was less than `n - 1` before the line, `current_health[i + 1]` remains unchanged because the condition for updating `current_health[i + 1]` is not met here.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`current_health[i - 1]` is decreased by `k`; `operations` is `operations + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then `current_health[i + 1]` is decreased by `k`.**
