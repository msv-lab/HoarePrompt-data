According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 1 up to `max_health + 1`. The loop variable `k` is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, and `operations` is its value or object.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Initial Condition**: The loop starts with `k` being 1.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: After the previous iteration, `k` would have been incremented by 1 (if it was within the range). Therefore, if `k` was 1 before the first iteration, it would now be `max_health` (since the loop would have run from 1 to `max_health` inclusive).
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `max_health + 1`. Hence, `k` needs to be incremented to `max_health + 1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be `max_health + 1`.

State: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is its value or object, `k` is `max_health + 1**.
