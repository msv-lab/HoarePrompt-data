Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `operations` is 1, `k` is `max_health + 1`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of `health` with `current_health[0]` being 0 or less, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: Given the if condition `i > 0`, if this condition is true, then `i` will be set to 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition will only consider the case where `i` becomes 1 when `i > 0` is true. Therefore, the overall postcondition includes the state where `i` is set to 1 under the condition that `i > 0`.
