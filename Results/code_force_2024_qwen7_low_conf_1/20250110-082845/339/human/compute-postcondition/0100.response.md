The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and `health`, which is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster. The function returns a list named `results` that contains the total number of operations performed for each value of `k` from 1 to `max_health`.
