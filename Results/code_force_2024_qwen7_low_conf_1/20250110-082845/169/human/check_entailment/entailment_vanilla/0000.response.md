Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing an array `a` into `k` subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) value of each subsegment is the same integer.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The provided `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
3. **Dividing Array**: The main logic of the program attempts to find the smallest integer `mex` and then divides the array into segments where each segment has `mex` as its MEX.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `mex` is 0 by directly splitting the array into two parts. It also handles the case where `mex` is not present in the array elements by ensuring that the last segment includes all remaining elements.
5. **Segment Construction**: The program constructs segments such that each segment's MEX is equal to `mex`. This is done by tracking the count of numbers less than `mex` and ensuring that once this count reaches `mex`, a new segment starts.
6. **Output Validation**: The program outputs the correct number of segments and their boundaries, ensuring that the constraints are met.

Given the above points, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
