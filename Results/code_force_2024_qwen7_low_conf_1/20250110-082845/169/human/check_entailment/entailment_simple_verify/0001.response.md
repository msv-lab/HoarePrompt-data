### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### 1. **Problem Understanding**
   - We need to divide an array `a` into `k` subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) value of each subsegment is the same integer.

#### 2. **MEX Calculation**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### 3. **Dividing Array**
   - The main logic of the program attempts to find the smallest integer `mex` and then divides the array into segments where each segment has `mex` as its MEX.

#### 4. **Edge Cases**
   - The program handles the edge case where `mex` is 0 by directly splitting the array into two parts.
   - It also handles the case where `mex` is not present in the array elements by ensuring that the last segment includes all remaining elements.

#### 5. **Segment Construction**
   - The program constructs segments such that each segment's MEX is equal to `mex`. This is done by tracking the count of numbers less than `mex` and ensuring that once this count reaches `mex`, a new segment starts.
   - If there are any remaining elements that do not form a complete segment, they are included in the last segment.

#### 6. **Output Validation**
   - The program outputs the correct number of segments and their boundaries, ensuring that the constraints are met.

Now, let's look at the annotated code to validate these points:

```python
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    size = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = func_1(arr)
    if mex == 0:
        print(2)
        print(1, 1)
        print(2, size)
        continue
    cnt = 0
    start = 0
    segments = []
    num_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        if arr[i] < mex:
            num_set.add(arr[i])
        if len(num_set) == mex:
            segments.append((start + 1, i + 1))
            start = i + 1
            num_set.clear()
    if num_set:
        segments[-1] = (segments[-1][0], size)
    if len(segments) < 2:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(segments))
        for seg in segments:
            print(seg[0], seg[1])

def func_1(arr):
    num_set = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in num_set:
        mex += 1
    return mex
```

- **MEX Calculation (`func_1`):**
  - Correctly calculates the MEX.
  
- **Segment Construction:**
  - Tracks the count of numbers less than `mex` using `num_set`.
  - When the count reaches `mex`, it adds a new segment and resets `num_set`.

- **Edge Cases Handling:**
  - Handles the case where `mex` is 0 by splitting the array into two parts.
  - Ensures that if there are any remaining elements that do not form a complete segment, they are included in the last segment.

- **Output:**
  - Outputs the correct number of segments and their boundaries.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
