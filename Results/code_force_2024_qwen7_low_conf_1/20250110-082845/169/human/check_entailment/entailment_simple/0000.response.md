Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array and the array itself for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array. This is done by creating a set of all unique elements in the array and incrementing the MEX until a value is found that is not in the set. This ensures that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The function then returns this MEX value, which is used in the main logic to determine how to partition the array.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program first calculates the MEX using the `func_1` function.
   - If the MEX is 0, the program directly outputs a valid division of the array into two subsegments, each with MEX 1.
   - If the MEX is greater than 0, the program iterates through the array to identify subsegments where the MEX is equal to the calculated MEX.
   - It uses a set (`num_set`) to keep track of the elements encountered so far and checks when the count of unique elements equals the MEX, indicating that all smaller integers are present in the segment. When this condition is met, it marks the end of one subsegment and starts a new one.
   - After processing the array, if any elements remain in the `num_set`, they are added to the last subsegment.
   - Finally, it checks if the number of identified subsegments is at least 2. If not, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid division exists. Otherwise, it prints the number of subsegments and their boundaries.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output according to the problem statement, ensuring that the constraints on the number of subsegments and their boundaries are respected.

Since the program handles all cases as specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs, it is considered correct.
