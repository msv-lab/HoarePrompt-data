Reasoning:  
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it adheres to the requirements and logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the verification process:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the MEX of the array. It uses a set to store unique elements and iterates through non-negative integers to find the smallest integer not present in the set. The function works correctly according to the provided execution summary.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - The first test case checks if the MEX is 0. If so, it prints a simple 2-segment solution directly. This part is handled correctly.
   - For other cases, it attempts to construct segments such that each segment has the same MEX value.
   - The logic for constructing segments seems to be based on counting the numbers up to the MEX value and then splitting the array accordingly.
   - After constructing the segments, it checks if the number of segments is at least 2. If not, it prints -1 indicating no valid solution exists. Otherwise, it prints the number of segments and the segment boundaries.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present, the MEX would be `n`. The program handles this case by checking if the number of segments is at least 2 before printing.
   - The program ensures that the segments are contiguous and cover the entire array.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find a valid segmentation or determine if no such segmentation exists, based on the MEX requirement. There are no apparent bugs or logical flaws in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
