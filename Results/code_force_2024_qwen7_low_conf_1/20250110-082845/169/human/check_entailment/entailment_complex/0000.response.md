Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Let's break down the steps and verify the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately. This is done correctly.

2. **Finding MEX**: The `func_1` function computes the MEX of the array. It creates a set of unique elements from the array and iterates to find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. This logic is correct and handles the edge case where all integers from 0 to the length of the array minus one are present.

3. **Dividing the Array**: For each test case, the main program calculates the MEX using `func_1`. If the MEX is 0, it directly prints the solution with two subsegments covering the entire array. Otherwise, it initializes variables to track the current segment and a set of numbers seen so far.

4. **Segment Construction**: The program iterates through the array and updates the set of numbers. When the set size matches the MEX, it indicates that all numbers from 0 to MEX-1 have appeared in the current segment. The program then starts a new segment and clears the set.

5. **Final Adjustments**: After the loop, if there are remaining numbers in the set, they are included in the last segment. If fewer than two segments are found, it means a valid division is not possible, and the program outputs `-1`.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program formats and outputs the results according to the specified requirements, ensuring the segments meet the conditions.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If all numbers from 0 to \(n-1\) are present in the array, the MEX will be \(n\), and no valid division exists. The program correctly handles this by outputting `-1`.

- If the array has repeated numbers, the program still works correctly as long as the MEX calculation and segment construction logic are sound.

Given the detailed annotations and the step-by-step verification, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic without any obvious bugs or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
