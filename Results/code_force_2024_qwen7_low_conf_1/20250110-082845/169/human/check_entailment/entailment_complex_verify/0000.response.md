### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `arr`.
- It works correctly by initializing a set `num_set` with all elements of `arr` and then finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.

#### Main Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   
2. **Case When MEX is 0**:
   - If `mex == 0`, the array already contains all numbers from 0 to `mex-1` (i.e., 0). Hence, we need to split the array into two parts where each part has a MEX of 1.
   - The program prints `2` and then two subsegments: `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]`.

3. **General Case**:
   - Initializes variables `cnt`, `start`, `segments`, and `num_set`.
   - Iterates through the array and collects numbers less than `mex` in `num_set`.
   - When `len(num_set) == mex`, it means the current segment has MEX equal to `mex`. It then appends this segment to `segments` and resets `num_set`.
   - After the loop, if `num_set` still contains some elements, it merges the last segment with the remaining part of the array.
   - If `segments` has fewer than 2 segments, it prints `-1` indicating no valid division exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the number of segments and their boundaries.

#### Analysis of the Example Provided in the Original Assessment:
Consider the test cases mentioned:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `4\n0 1 2 3`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The program incorrectly outputs `2\n1 1\n2 3`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `3\n0 1 2`
  - Expected Output: `-1`
  - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Edge Case**:
  - Array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - MEX: 4
  - No valid division exists since the array contains all integers from 0 to 3.
  - The program should output `-1`, but it mistakenly splits the array into `[1, 1]` and `[2, 4]`.

#### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the edge case where the array already contains all integers from 0 to `mex-1`. It does not correctly identify this situation and instead attempts to split the array, leading to incorrect outputs.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
