### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing an array `a` into `k` subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) value of each subsegment is the same integer.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The provided `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. This is confirmed by the annotation and the code itself.
3. **Dividing Array**: The main logic of the program attempts to find the smallest integer `mex` and then divides the array into segments where each segment has `mex` as its MEX. However, the implementation has several issues:
   - The logic for constructing segments is flawed. The program only tracks the count of numbers less than `mex` and starts a new segment when this count reaches `mex`. This approach does not guarantee that the MEX of each segment will be `mex`.
   - The program assumes that once `len(num_set)` equals `mex`, the MEX of the current segment is `mex`. This is not always true, as the MEX depends on the presence of all numbers from `0` to `mex-1` in the segment.
   - The program does not ensure that each segment is properly formed to have the correct MEX value.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `mex` is 0 by directly splitting the array into two parts, which is correct. However, it fails to handle other edge cases properly, such as when the array contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`.
5. **Segment Construction**: The program constructs segments by tracking the count of numbers less than `mex` and starting a new segment when this count reaches `mex`. This approach is not sufficient to ensure that the MEX of each segment is `mex`. For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with `mex = 5`. The program would incorrectly split the array into `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with a segment count of 1, which does not satisfy the requirement.
6. **Output Validation**: The program outputs the number of segments and their boundaries, but these boundaries are not guaranteed to be correct due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The approach to constructing segments is flawed, and it does not ensure that each segment has the correct MEX value.

**Final: False**
