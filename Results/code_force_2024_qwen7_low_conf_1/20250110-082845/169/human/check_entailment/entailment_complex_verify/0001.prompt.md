You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the Master's Assistance Center, Nyam-Nyam was given a homework assignment
in informatics.

There is an array a of length n , and you want to divide it into k > 1
subsegments^{\dagger} in such a way that the \operatorname{MEX} ^{\ddagger} on
each subsegment is equal to the same integer.

Help Nyam-Nyam find any suitable division, or determine that it does not
exist.

^{\dagger} A division of an array into k subsegments is defined as k pairs of
integers (l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2), \ldots, (l_k, r_k) such that l_i \le r_i and
for each 1 \le j \le k - 1 , l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1 , and also l_1 = 1 and r_k =
n . These pairs represent the subsegments themselves.

^{\ddagger}\operatorname{MEX} of an array is the smallest non-negative integer
that does not belong to the array.

For example:

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [2, 2, 1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [3, 1, 0, 1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the array [0, 3, 1, 2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer -1 if a suitable division does not
exist.

Otherwise, on the first line, output an integer k (2 \le k \le n ) — the
number of subsegments in the division.

Then output k lines — the division into subsegments. The i -th line should
contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the boundaries
of the i -th subsegment.

The following conditions must be satisfied:

  * For all 1 \le j \le k - 1 , l_{j + 1} = r_j + 1 ;
  * l_1 = 1 , r_k = n .

If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    0 0
    
    5
    
    0 1 2 3 4
    
    8
    
    0 1 7 1 0 1 0 3
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 0

Output

    2
    1 1
    2 2
    -1
    3
    1 3
    4 5
    6 8
    3
    1 1
    2 2
    3 3
    -1

Note

In the first test case, the array a can be divided into 2 subsegments with
boundaries [1, 1] and [2, 2] :

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the first subsegment [0] is 1 , as 0 belongs to the subsegment, but 1 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the second subsegment [0] is 1 , as 0 belongs to the subsegment, but 1 does not. 

In the second test case, it can be proven that the required division does not
exist.

In the third test case, the array a can be divided into 3 subsegments with
boundaries [1, 3] , [4, 5] , [6, 8] :

  * \operatorname{MEX} of the first subsegment [0, 1, 7] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the second subsegment [1, 0] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not. 
  * \operatorname{MEX} of the third subsegment [1, 0, 3] is 2 , as 0 and 1 belong to the subsegment, but 2 does not.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
def func_1(arr):
    num_set = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in num_set:
        mex += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` including `0`.
    return mex
    #The program returns `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2. It then creates a set `num_set` containing the unique elements from `arr`, including `0`. The function iterates through non-negative integers starting from `0` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`. This integer is stored in the variable `mex`. Finally, the function returns `mex`. Potential edge cases include when all integers from `0` to the length of `arr` - 1 are present in `arr`, in which case `mex` would be equal to the length of `arr`. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing an array `a` into `k` subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) value of each subsegment is the same integer.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The provided `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
3. **Dividing Array**: The main logic of the program attempts to find the smallest integer `mex` and then divides the array into segments where each segment has `mex` as its MEX.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `mex` is 0 by directly splitting the array into two parts. It also handles the case where `mex` is not present in the array elements by ensuring that the last segment includes all remaining elements.
5. **Segment Construction**: The program constructs segments such that each segment's MEX is equal to `mex`. This is done by tracking the count of numbers less than `mex` and ensuring that once this count reaches `mex`, a new segment starts.
6. **Output Validation**: The program outputs the correct number of segments and their boundaries, ensuring that the constraints are met.

Given the above points, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified.
