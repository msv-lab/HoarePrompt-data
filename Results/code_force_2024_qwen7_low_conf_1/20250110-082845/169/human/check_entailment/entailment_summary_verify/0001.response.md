### Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing an array \( a \) into \( k \) subsegments such that the MEX (minimum excluded) value of each subsegment is the same integer.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. This part is correct.

3. **Dividing Array**: The main logic of the program attempts to find the smallest integer `mex` and then divides the array into segments where each segment has `mex` as its MEX. This part is generally correct, but let's analyze further.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The program handles the edge case where `mex` is 0 by directly splitting the array into two parts. This is correct.
   - The program also handles the case where `mex` is not present in the array elements by ensuring that the last segment includes all remaining elements. However, there is a potential issue here. If the entire array consists of elements that are less than `mex`, the program will not correctly handle this case.

5. **Segment Construction**: The program constructs segments such that each segment's MEX is equal to `mex`. This is done by tracking the count of numbers less than `mex` and ensuring that once this count reaches `mex`, a new segment starts. This logic seems correct, but we need to verify it thoroughly.

6. **Output Validation**: The program outputs the correct number of segments and their boundaries, ensuring that the constraints are met. This part is correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the case where `mex` is not present in the array. If the array consists entirely of elements that are less than `mex`, the program might not correctly identify this situation and may incorrectly conclude that the array can be divided into segments with the required MEX value.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's consider an example where the array consists entirely of elements that are less than `mex`:

- Example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `mex = 5`

In this case, the array cannot be divided into segments such that each segment has `mex` as its MEX. The program would incorrectly output a division, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the array cannot be divided into segments with the required MEX value if the array consists entirely of elements less than `mex`.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis, the original assessment is partially correct but misses a crucial edge case. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
