### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the issues it faces:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array.
   - It checks for the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program attempts to find a valid division of the array into subsegments such that the MEX of each subsegment is the same.
   - If `mex == 0`, it directly outputs a division into two subsegments with MEX 1.
   - Otherwise, it tries to construct the subsegments based on the current `mex` value.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Complete MEX Set**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array already contains all integers from 0 to `mex-1`. In such cases, no valid division exists as described in the problem statement.
   - For example, consider the input `[0, 1, 2]` where `mex = 3`. No valid division exists because the array already contains all integers from 0 to 2.

2. **Incorrect Division Handling**:
   - The program assumes that if the current segment does not contain `mex`, it can add elements to form a valid subsegment. However, it fails to recognize when the array already contains all integers up to `mex-1`.
   - The logic to clear the `num_set` and append the current segment might miss the edge case where the array already contains all integers up to `mex-1`.

### Example Revisited:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  2
  4
  0 1 2 3
  3
  0 1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  -1
  3
  1 1
  2 2
  3 3
  ```

- **Program Output**:
  ```
  2
  1 1
  2 3
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - For the second test case `[0, 1, 2]`, the MEX is `3`. However, no valid division into subsegments where each subsegment's MEX is 3 exists. The program incorrectly outputs `2` subsegments instead of `-1`.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly identify the invalid cases and outputs incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to its inability to handle the case where the array already contains all integers from 0 to `mex-1`, leading to invalid divisions.
