Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array already contains all integers from 0 to `mex-1`. In such cases, no valid division exists as described in the problem statement. Let's consider an example:

### Example
**Input:**
```
2
4
0 1 2 3
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2
1 1
2 3
```

This is incorrect because for the second test case, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has `mex = 3`, but no valid division into subsegments where each subsegment's MEX is 3 exists. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.

### Reasoning
- The program checks if `mex == 0` and handles this case by splitting the array into two parts with MEX 1.
- For other cases, it attempts to create subsegments based on the current `mex` value.
- However, it does not handle the scenario where the array already contains all integers from 0 to `mex-1`, which is a valid condition that the program should recognize as impossible to satisfy with the given constraints.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle this specific edge case, leading to incorrect results.
