#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
def func_1(arr):
    num_set = set(arr)
    mex = 0
    while mex in num_set:
        mex += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` including `0`.
    return mex
    #The program returns `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2. It then creates a set `num_set` containing the unique elements from `arr`, including `0`. The function iterates through non-negative integers starting from `0` until it finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`. This integer is stored in the variable `mex`. Finally, the function returns `mex`. Potential edge cases include when all integers from `0` to the length of `arr` - 1 are present in `arr`, in which case `mex` would be equal to the length of `arr`. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
