The code updates the value of `i` to `i + 2` and prints the new value of `i` along with the value of `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `i` was initially `i + 1`, so now it is `i + 2`. The value of `n` remains a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The other variables (`a`, `cur_have`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have[cur_mex]`, `another_mex`, and `another_have`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)**
