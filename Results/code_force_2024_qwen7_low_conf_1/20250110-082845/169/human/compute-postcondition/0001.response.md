The line `mex = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `mex`. However, since `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`, these conditions and the values of `arr` and `num_set` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`; `mex` is 0.**
