The code decrements `cur_have[a[i]]` by 1. This means the value of `cur_have` at the index `a[i]` will be decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is \( i + 1 \)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`
- `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged
- `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1
- `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1

After executing the code, the only change is in `cur_have[a[i]]`.

Output State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1**
