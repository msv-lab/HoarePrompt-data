In the given code snippet, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `a[i]` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\). This means `another_have[a[i]]` will be incremented from 0 to 1.

Let's summarize the changes:

- `another_have[a[i]]` was initially 0 and is now incremented to 1.
- All other values in `another_have` remain 0 since no other elements are modified.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have[a[i]]`, and `another_mex`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.**
