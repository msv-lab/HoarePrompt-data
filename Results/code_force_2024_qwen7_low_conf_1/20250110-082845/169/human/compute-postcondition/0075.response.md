Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with all counts decremented by one for each occurrence of `a_i`, `cur_mex` is the maximum index in `cur_have` that is non-zero, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero, and `another_mex` is the maximum value of `a` plus the number of iterations the loop has executed, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.**

### Explanation:
- **`cur_have`**: This list keeps track of the frequency of each value in `a`. After the loop completes, `cur_have[a[i]]` for all `i` will be zero because each element in `a` is decremented exactly once in each iteration.
- **`cur_mex`**: This variable holds the maximum index in `cur_have` that is still non-zero. Initially, it is set based on the input `a` and updates during each iteration.
- **`another_have`**: This list keeps track of the frequencies of the values in `a` that have been encountered. It is incremented each time an element is seen in the loop, and `another_mex` is updated to the next available value when `another_have[another_mex]` becomes non-zero.
- **`another_mex`**: This variable tracks the next available index that has not yet appeared in `a`. It starts from the maximum value in `a` and increments by 1 for each iteration until it reaches a value that has not yet been seen.

Since the loop will execute for each element in `a`, the final state of the variables will reflect the decrementing of frequencies in `cur_have` and the tracking of frequencies in `another_have`. The condition `cur_mex != another_mex` ensures that the loop does not terminate prematurely.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), the initial values of the variables will be maintained:
- `cur_have` will remain as initialized.
- `cur_mex` will remain as the initial maximum index.
- `another_have` and `another_mex` will also remain as initialized.
