The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1. According to the initial state, `another_mex` is `a[i] + 1 + 1`. Therefore, after the increment, `another_mex` becomes `a[i] + 2`.

The other variables remain unaffected. So, the output state includes the updated value of `another_mex` and retains the other initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is `a[i] + 2`; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1, and `another_have[a[i] + 2]` must be non-zero.**
