The code initializes the variable `another_mex` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a`, and `another_mex` is 0.**
