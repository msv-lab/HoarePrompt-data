The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1. Given that `another_mex` was previously equal to the largest value in `a` plus 3, the new value of `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 4.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `another_mex`.

Output State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `another_mex` is now equal to the largest value in `a` plus 4, and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.**
