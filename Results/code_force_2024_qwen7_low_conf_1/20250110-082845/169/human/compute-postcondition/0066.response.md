According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `another_have[another_mex]`. For the loop to continue executing, this condition must be true. At the end of the last iteration, `another_mex` is `initial_value + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `another_have[another_mex]` evaluates to `True`. Given that `another_mex` is now `initial_value + 1`, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `another_have[initial_value + 1]` is `True`.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **`another_mex` is `initial_value + 1` and `another_have[initial_value + 1]` is `True`**
