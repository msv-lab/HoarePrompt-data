Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes an input array `a` of length `n` and determines if there are two distinct positions in the array where the minimum excluded number (mex) of the subarrays starting from those positions are equal. If such positions exist, the function prints "2" followed by the 1-based indices of these positions, otherwise it prints "-1". 

After the function concludes, the program will either print "2" followed by two 1-based indices indicating the positions in the array where the mex values are equal, or it will print "-1" if no such positions exist.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the input array `a` correctly by decrementing the count of elements in `cur_have` and `another_have` during the second loop.
- However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is 2. When `n` is 2, the loop might not run as expected because `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`, which would only execute once. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the array `a` is such that `cur_mex` and `another_mex` do not get updated properly.
- The function correctly updates `cur_mex` and `another_mex` based on the counts in `cur_have` and `another_have`, respectively, but it does not explicitly handle the scenario where the entire array `a` consists of unique elements (i.e., every element from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once). In such a case, `cur_mex` and `another_mex` would always be the same, leading to a potential incorrect print of "-1".
- The function does not check if `cur_mex` and `another_mex` are equal before printing "2" and the indices. It directly checks if `cur_mex` equals `another_mex` inside the loop, which means it might miss cases where `cur_mex` and `another_mex` become equal outside the loop's iteration.**

This summary captures the actual behavior of the function and highlights potential edge cases and missing functionality.
