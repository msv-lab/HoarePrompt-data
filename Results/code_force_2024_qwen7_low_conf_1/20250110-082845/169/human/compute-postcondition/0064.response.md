Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the provided program state step by step.

### Given Program State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is \( i + k + 1 \)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`
- `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 2 \)
- `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1
- `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero

### While Loop Condition:
```
while another_have[another_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will continue to execute as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must remain non-zero.

Since `another_have[another_mex]` is already non-zero according to the given state, no change is required for this specific state.

However, we need to ensure that the conditions leading up to this state are correct for the loop to continue executing. Let's reiterate the key points:

1. `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 2 \).
2. `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

These conditions should remain unchanged for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
No additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time based on the provided state.

**State:** **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 2 \), `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero**
