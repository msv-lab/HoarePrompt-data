To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues: `cur_have[cur_mex]`.

Given:
- The loop condition is `cur_have[cur_mex]`.
- `cur_mex` is initially set to 1.

For the loop to continue executing, `cur_have[cur_mex]` must be non-zero. Since `cur_mex` is set to 1, the condition simplifies to checking `cur_have[1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_mex` is 1.
- `cur_have[0]` is non-zero (as given).

The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `cur_have[1]`, which must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `cur_have[1]` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where at least one element in `cur_have` (specifically `cur_have[0]`) is non-zero, `cur_mex` is 1, and `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero**.
