Step-by-step analysis:
- The code `cur_have[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of the value `a[i]` in the `cur_have` list.
- Since `a[i]` is an element from the list `a` (where each element is an integer between 0 and `n-1`), `cur_have[a[i]]` will be decremented by 1.
- The `cur_have` list is updated such that the frequency of the value `a[i]` is reduced by 1.
- The values of other variables (`n`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `another_mex`, and `another_have`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` remains the same or decreases if the count of `a[i]` was the last non-zero count at `cur_mex`; `another_mex` is 0; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.**
