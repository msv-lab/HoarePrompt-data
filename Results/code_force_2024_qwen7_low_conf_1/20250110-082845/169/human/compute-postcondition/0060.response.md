Postcondition: ***`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.***
