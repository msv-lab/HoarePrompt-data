Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is \( i + k \)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero
- `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`
- `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`
- `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \)
- `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was \( i + k \).
   - For the loop to continue, \( i + k < n \).

2. **Update `i`**: In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be \( (i + k) + 1 = i + k + 1 \).

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.
   - `cur_have` and `cur_mex` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the current value of `a[i]`.
   - `another_mex` is derived from the maximum value in `a` and does not change within the loop.
   - `another_have` remains the same as it is not updated inside the loop.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is \( i + k + 1 \)
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` remains a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` and `cur_mex` will be updated, but their exact values depend on the new value of `a[i + k + 1]`.
- `another_mex` remains the same as the maximum value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \).
- `another_have[another_mex]` must still be non-zero.
- `cur_mex` will be the new maximum value found in `a` for the new `i`.

Given these points, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` and `cur_mex` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i + k + 1]`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**
