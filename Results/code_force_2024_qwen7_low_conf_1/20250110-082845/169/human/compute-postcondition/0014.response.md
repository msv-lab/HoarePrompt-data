The code increments the value of `cur_mex` by 1. The initial value of `cur_mex` is 1, so after the increment, `cur_mex` will be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where at least one element in `cur_have` (specifically `cur_have[0]`) is non-zero, `cur_mex` is 2, and `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero.**
