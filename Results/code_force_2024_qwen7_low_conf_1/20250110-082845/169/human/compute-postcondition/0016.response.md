`cur_mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur_mex` is 2, so after incrementing, `cur_mex` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where at least one element in `cur_have` (specifically `cur_have[0]`) is non-zero, `cur_mex` is 3, and `cur_have[2]` is non-zero.**
