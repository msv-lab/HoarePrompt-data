The code creates a set `num_set` from the list `arr`. This means that any duplicates in the list `arr` will be removed, and `num_set` will contain only unique elements from `arr`.

Given the initial state where `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, the following is true about `arr`:
- Each element in `arr` is a non-negative integer.
- Each element is less than the length of `arr`.
- The length of `arr` is at least 2.

After executing the line `num_set = set(arr)`, the list `arr` remains unchanged, but the set `num_set` contains the unique elements from `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`.**
