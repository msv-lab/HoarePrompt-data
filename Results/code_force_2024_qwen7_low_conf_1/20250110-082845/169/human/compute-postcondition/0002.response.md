Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
   - `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`.
   - `mex` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs as long as `mex` is in `num_set`.

3. **Objective**: 
   - We need to adjust the program state such that the condition `mex in num_set` is true after the first iteration of the loop.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Initially, `mex` is 0.
   - For the loop to proceed, `0` must be added to `num_set` in the first iteration.

5. **Adjustment**:
   - In the first iteration of the loop, `mex` (which starts as 0) should be added to `num_set`.

6. **New State After First Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `0` will be added to `num_set`.
   - Therefore, `0` will now be in `num_set`, satisfying the loop condition.

Based on this analysis, we only need to ensure that `0` is added to `num_set` in the first iteration. However, since the question asks us to modify the program state right before the loop, we need to reflect this in the given state.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
- `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`, but `0` must be added to `num_set` before the loop starts.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must include 0; `mex` is 0**.
