Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is \( i + k + 1 \)
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
   - `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
   - `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`
   - `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \)
   - `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   another_have[a[i]] += 1
   ```

This line increments the count of `a[i]` in the `another_have` dictionary.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The value of `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1.
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

4. **Output State**:
   - `i` is \( i + k + 1 \)
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
   - `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
   - `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`
   - `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \)
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1
   - `another_have[another_mex]` remains non-zero

Therefore, the Output State is:

**Output State: **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \); `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \); `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`; `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \); `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1; `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero**
