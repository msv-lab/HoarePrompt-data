The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` is 1, so after the increment, `mex` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `num_set`) are not affected.

Output State: **`mex` is 2, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included and must include `1`.**
