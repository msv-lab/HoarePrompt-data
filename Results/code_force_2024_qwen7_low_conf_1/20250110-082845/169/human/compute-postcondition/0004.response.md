To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the condition of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `mex` (minimum excluded) is 1.
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
- `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `mex` is in `num_set`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - `mex` is initially 1.
   - `mex` must be in `num_set` for the loop to continue.

2. **Current State:**
   - `mex` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `mex` must still be in `num_set`.

3. **What Needs to Change:**
   - Since `mex` is 1 and it is already in `num_set`, the only way to allow the loop to execute again is to ensure that `mex` remains in `num_set`.
   - This means that the set `num_set` must still contain `mex` (which is 1).

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `mex` remains in `num_set` for the next iteration.
   - The values in `arr` and `num_set` should not change in such a way that removes `mex` from `num_set`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current state is valid for the loop to continue because `mex` (1) is in `num_set`.
   - No additional adjustments are required beyond ensuring that `mex` remains in `num_set`.

### Final State:
State: **`mex` is 1, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included and must include `1`**.
