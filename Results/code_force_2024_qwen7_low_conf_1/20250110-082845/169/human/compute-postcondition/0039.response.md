Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States:
- \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- \( a \) is a list of length \( n \) where each element \( a_i \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \).
- \( cur\_have \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements up to \( cur\_mex - 1 \) are non-zero, \( cur\_mex \) is the maximum value such that \( cur\_have[cur\_mex] \) is non-zero, and \( cur\_have \) at indices up to \( cur\_mex - 1 \) contains the frequencies of those indices in the array \( a \) with one less count for \( a[i] \).
- \( cur\_mex \) is updated to \( a[i] \) if \( cur\_have[a[i]] == 0 \) and \( cur\_mex > a[i] \), otherwise \( cur\_mex \) remains unchanged.
- \( another\_mex \) is the largest value in \( a \) plus 1.
- \( another\_have \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where all elements are zero except \( another\_have[a[i]] \) which is 1.
- \( cur\_mex \neq another\_mex \).

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for each \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \).

### Adjusting States:
At the end of the previous iteration:
- \( i \) is incremented by 1.
- \( a_i \) is processed based on the current values of \( cur\_have \) and \( cur\_mex \).

#### Updated States:
1. **Incrementing \( i \):**
   - \( i \) will be \( i + 1 \).

2. **Processing \( a_i \):**
   - \( cur\_have[a[i]] \) is decremented by 1.
   - If \( cur\_have[a[i]] \) becomes 0 and \( a[i] < cur\_mex \), then \( cur\_mex \) is updated to \( a[i] \).

3. **Checking \( cur\_mex \) and \( another\_mex \):**
   - \( another\_mex \) remains the same as it is the largest value in \( a \) plus 1.

4. **List Lengths and Elements:**
   - \( cur\_have \) and \( another\_have \) lists remain the same lengths but their contents change based on the processing of \( a_i \).

### Final States:
- \( i \) is \( i + 1 \).
- \( cur\_have \) and \( another\_have \) lists are updated based on the processing of \( a_i \).
- \( cur\_mex \) is updated if necessary (i.e., if \( cur\_have[a[i]] == 0 \) and \( a[i] < cur\_mex \)).
- \( another\_mex \) remains the same.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1; **`cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex` and `i` is incremented by 1**.**

State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1; **`cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`**.**
