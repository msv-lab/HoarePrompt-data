To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Let's review the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`.
- `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged.
- `another_mex` is `a[i] + 1`.
- `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.

Given these definitions, `another_have[another_mex]` will be non-zero if `another_mex` is equal to `a[i] + 1`. Since `another_mex` is defined as `a[i] + 1`, `another_have[another_mex]` will be 1, which satisfies the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must remain non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `another_have[a[i] + 1]` stays 1.

Since the only place where `another_have[a[i] + 1]` is set to 1 is in the loop body (which is omitted), and there is no indication that this value changes inside the loop, we don't need to change any other state to keep `another_have[a[i] + 1]` as 1.

Thus, no additional adjustments are required beyond ensuring that the loop condition is met.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is `a[i] + 1`; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1**
