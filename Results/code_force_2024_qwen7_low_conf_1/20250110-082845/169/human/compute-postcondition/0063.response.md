The code increments `another_mex` by 1. According to the initial state, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \). After incrementing, the new value of `another_mex` will be the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 2 \).

Output State: **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \); `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \); `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1; `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`; `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 2 \); `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1; `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero**
