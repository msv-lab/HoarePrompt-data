The code `mex += 1` increments the value of `mex` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `mex`, we can assume it to be 0 (a common starting point for such operations). After incrementing, the new value of `mex` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`arr` and `num_set`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mex` is 1, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included.**
