To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions given in the `while` loop and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `i` is \( i + 1 \)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, and `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is now equal to the largest value in `a` plus 3, and it must appear in the list `a`
- `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero

For the loop to continue, `another_have[another_mex]` must remain non-zero. Since `another_mex` is determined based on the properties of the array `a`, and the only condition directly affecting `another_have[another_mex]` is that it must be non-zero, no changes are required to the existing state to ensure this condition holds.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustments to proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `another_mex` is now equal to the largest value in `a` plus 3, and it must appear in the list `a`, and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero**
