The code prints `-1`. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with all counts decremented by one for each occurrence of `a_i`, `cur_mex` is the maximum index in `cur_have` that is non-zero, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero, and `another_mex` is the maximum value of `a` plus the number of iterations the loop has executed, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; the output is -1.**
