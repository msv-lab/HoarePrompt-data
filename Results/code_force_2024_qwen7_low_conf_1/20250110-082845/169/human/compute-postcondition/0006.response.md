Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mex` (minimum excluded) is currently 2.
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2.
   - `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included and must include `1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `while mex in num_set:`.
   - For the loop to continue, `mex` must be in `num_set`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `mex` is currently 2.
   - Since `mex` is 2, and `2` is in `num_set` (as `num_set` includes unique elements from `arr` and must include `1`, but there is no information that explicitly excludes `2`), the current loop condition is satisfied.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To continue the loop, `mex` must remain in `num_set` for the next iteration.
   - However, since the problem does not specify any changes to `mex`, `arr`, or `num_set` within the loop body, we need to ensure that `mex` remains in `num_set` without changing the given constraints.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the current values and the loop condition, `mex` is already in `num_set` and no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can continue.

**State:**
**`mex` is 2, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2, `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` with `0` included and must include `1`.**
