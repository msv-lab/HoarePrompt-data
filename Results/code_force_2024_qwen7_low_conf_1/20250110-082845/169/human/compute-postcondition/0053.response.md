The code prints '1 ' followed by the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is updated by adding 1 to itself due to the loop execution count, and the value of `cur_mex` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. Additionally, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`. Output: 1 **`i + 1`**.**
