The given code snippet does not affect the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `cur_mex`, `another_mex`, or `another_have` directly. It only prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + k + 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the initial value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero, and the print statement executes, printing '1 ' followed by the value of `i + 2`.**
