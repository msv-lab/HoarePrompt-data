Postcondition: **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the initial value of `another_mex` plus the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero**
