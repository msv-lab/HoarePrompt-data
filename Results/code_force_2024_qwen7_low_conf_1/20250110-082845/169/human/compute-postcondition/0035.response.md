The code `print('1 ' + str(i + 1))` prints the value of `i + 1` in the format '1 X', where `X` is the value of `i + 1`. However, the code does not change any of the existing variables or lists. The variables `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `cur_mex`, `another_mex`, `another_have`, and the fact that the program has printed 2 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1; the current value of `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`; the program has printed 2, and the output is '1 i + 1'.**
