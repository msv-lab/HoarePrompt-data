The code snippet updates `cur_mex` to the value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `cur_mex` was previously the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero. Since `cur_mex` is now set to `a[i]`, `cur_mex` becomes `a[i]`.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `another_mex`, and `another_have`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is now `a[i]`; `another_mex` is 0; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.**
