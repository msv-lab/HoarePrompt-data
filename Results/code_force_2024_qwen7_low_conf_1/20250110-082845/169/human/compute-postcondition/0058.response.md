The code decrements `cur_have[a[i]]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `another_mex`, and `another_have[another_mex]` are not affected. The condition that `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.**
