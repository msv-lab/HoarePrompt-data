To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables involved.

The loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
```

This means the loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. Given the output state before the loop, we know that `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initially zero, and after the code snippet `another_have[a[i]] += 1`, the value of `another_have[a[i]]` becomes 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State of `another_have`:**
   - All elements in `another_have` are zero.

2. **After Incrementing `another_have[a[i]]`:**
   - The value of `another_have[a[i]]` is 1.
   - All other elements in `another_have` remain zero.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero when `another_mex` points to `a[i]`.

Since `another_have[a[i]]` is the only non-zero element in `another_have` (it is 1), `another_mex` should point to `a[i]` for the loop to execute. Therefore, `another_mex` must be set to `a[i]` for the loop to proceed.

Given that the loop condition checks if `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero, and knowing that `another_have[a[i]]` is the only non-zero element, we need to ensure that `another_mex` is set to `a[i]` for the loop to execute.

**State Adjustment:**
- Ensure that `another_mex` is set to `a[i]`.

Thus, the required state adjustment is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is set to `a[i]`; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.**
