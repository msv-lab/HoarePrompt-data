To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the program:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

2. **Current State**:
   - `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.
   - `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1.
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. However, based on the current state, `another_have[another_mex]` is zero because `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1, and there are no occurrences of `another_mex` in the list `a`.

### Adjustment Needed:
To make the loop execute at least once, we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` becomes non-zero. This can only happen if `another_mex` appears in the list `a`, which would increment `another_have[another_mex]` from 0 to 1.

### Modified Program State:
- Since `another_mex` must appear in `a` for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state so that `another_mex` is present in `a`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1, and `another_mex` must appear in the list `a`.**

In summary, the state must be adjusted to ensure `another_mex` is present in the list `a`.
