The code snippet prints `i + 2` and `n` concatenated as a string. The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, `cur_mex`, `another_mex`, and `another_have` are not directly affected by this print statement. The previous value of `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`. 

The output of the print statement will be `1 (i + 1)` since `i` was initially 1 and it is incremented by 2, making it 3. Therefore, the printed value is `3 100000`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 1, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1, the current value of `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `i` is 3, and the program has printed `3 100000`.**
