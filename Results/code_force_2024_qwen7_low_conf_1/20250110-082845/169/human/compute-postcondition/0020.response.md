Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- The array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a`.
- `cur_mex` is an integer (already defined).
- `another_mex` is 0.
- `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `n` is at least 1. However, given the constraints, we know that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), so `n` will always be valid for the loop to execute.

### States to Adjust:
1. **`n`**: Since the loop iterates `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer.
2. **`a`**: The array `a` should be properly defined as a list of length `n` with valid values \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
3. **`cur_have`**: This list should be correctly initialized as described, with the frequencies of indices in `a` up to `cur_mex - 1`.
4. **`cur_mex`**: This value should be correctly set based on the initial counts in `cur_have`.
5. **`another_mex`**: Since `another_mex` is initialized to 0 and no operations change its value within the loop, this remains valid.
6. **`another_have`**: This list is initialized to all zeros, which is correct and does not need adjustment.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `n` is valid and the arrays `a`, `cur_have`, and other relevant structures are correctly initialized.

**State:**
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a`.
- `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero.
- `another_mex` is 0.
- `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.**
