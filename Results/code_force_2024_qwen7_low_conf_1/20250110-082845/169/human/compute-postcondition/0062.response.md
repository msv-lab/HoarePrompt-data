Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `i` is \( i + k + 1 \)
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
   - `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
   - `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`
   - `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \)
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1
   - `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while another_have[another_mex]:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero right before the loop starts.

4. **Verification:**
   - Given that `another_have[another_mex]` is already specified to be non-zero, no additional adjustments are needed for this specific condition to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, no further modifications to the program state are required for the loop to execute at least one iteration based on the given conditions.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is \( i + k + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is either equal to `a[i]` (if the if condition is true) or not equal to `a[i]` and still not equal to `another_mex`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), `another_have[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero**
