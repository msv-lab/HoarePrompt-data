Let's break down the given problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `another_have[another_mex]`: This is the key condition for the loop to continue. The loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
- `another_mex`: The largest value in `a` plus 2, and it must appear in the list `a`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is \( i + 1 \)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 2, and it must appear in the list `a`
- `another_have[another_mex]`: This is the current state of interest for the loop continuation

### Analysis
- For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.
- Since `another_mex` is defined as the largest value in `a` plus 2, and it must appear in the list `a`, the only state we need to adjust is `another_have[another_mex]` to ensure it is non-zero.

### Adjusted States
- `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is \( i + 1 \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`, `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus 2, and it must appear in the list `a`, and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero**.
