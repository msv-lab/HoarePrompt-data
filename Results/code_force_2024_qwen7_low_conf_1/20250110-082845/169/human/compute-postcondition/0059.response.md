The code sets `cur_mex` to the value of `a[i]`. This means that the current maximum exclusive ( mex ) value for the current element in the list `a` is now `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

- `i` is \( i \) (unchanged)
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \)
- `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `cur_mex` is now equal to `a[i]`
- `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \)
- `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero

Output State: **`i` is \( i \), `n` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \( 0 \leq a_i < n \), `cur_have` is updated such that `cur_have[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`, `another_mex` is the largest value in `a` plus \( k + 1 \), `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.**
