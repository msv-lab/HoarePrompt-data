To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `cur_have[cur_mex]`. For the loop to continue executing, `cur_have[cur_mex]` must be true (non-zero).

Given the current state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- The array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\)
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where at least one element in `cur_have` (specifically `cur_have[0]`) is non-zero
- `cur_mex` is 2
- `cur_have[1]` must be non-zero

We need to ensure that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero for the loop to execute again. Since `cur_mex` is 2, we need to ensure that `cur_have[2]` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that `cur_have[2]` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), the array `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\), `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where at least one element in `cur_have` (specifically `cur_have[0]`) is non-zero, `cur_mex` is 2, and `cur_have[2]` must be non-zero**.
