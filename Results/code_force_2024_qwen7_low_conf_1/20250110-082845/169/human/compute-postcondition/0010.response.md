The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of the list is at least 2. After executing the function body, the function returns `mex`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `num_set`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of non-negative integers, and return the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set of numbers derived from the list.
