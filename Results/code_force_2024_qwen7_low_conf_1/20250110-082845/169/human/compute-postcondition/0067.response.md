`another_mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `another_mex` was equal to `initial_value + 1`. Therefore, after executing `another_mex += 1`, the new value of `another_mex` will be `(initial_value + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `initial_value + 2`.

The state of `another_have[initial_value + 1]` remains unchanged, as the code only modifies `another_mex`.

Output State: **`another_mex` is `initial_value + 2`, `another_have[initial_value + 1]` is `True`**
