Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
- `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, and `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero. The list `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`.
- `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged.
- `another_mex` is defined as `a[i] + 1 + 1`.
- `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while another_have[another_mex]:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
2. **State Before Loop**: 
   - `another_mex` is `a[i] + 1 + 1 = a[i] + 2`.
   - We need to check the value of `another_have[another_mex]` to see if the loop should continue.

### Adjustments Needed:
For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. Since `another_mex` is `a[i] + 2`, we need to ensure that `another_have[a[i] + 2]` is non-zero at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `another_have[a[i] + 2]` is non-zero.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is `a[i] + 1 + 1`; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1, and `another_have[a[i] + 2]` must be non-zero.**

Note: The specific values of `n`, `a`, `cur_have`, and `cur_mex` do not need to be adjusted unless they affect the value of `another_mex` or `another_have`. The key adjustment is ensuring that `another_have[a[i] + 2]` is non-zero.
