The code snippet `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `another_have[a[i]]` by 1. This affects the `another_have` list specifically.

- Before the code execution, `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero.
- After the code execution, the value of `another_have[a[i]]` will be 1 because it was incremented by 1.

All other variables remain unaffected by this code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is a list of length `n` where each element `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < n\); `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements up to `cur_mex - 1` are non-zero, `cur_mex` is the maximum value such that `cur_have[cur_mex]` is non-zero, and `cur_have` at indices up to `cur_mex - 1` contains the frequencies of those indices in the array `a` with one less count for `a[i]`; `cur_mex` is updated to `a[i]` if `cur_have[a[i]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[i]`, otherwise `cur_mex` remains unchanged; `another_mex` is 0; `another_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are zero except `another_have[a[i]]` which is 1.**
