The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code, the only impact is that the program exits the current context, but the variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is equal to \( (z + 1) // 2 \), `z` is an integer, `j` is \( z // 2 \), `p` must be such that \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \)**
