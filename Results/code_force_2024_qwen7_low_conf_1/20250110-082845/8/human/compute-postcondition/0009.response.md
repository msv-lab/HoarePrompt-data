Let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop and the current state to determine what needs to be adjusted:

### Given Conditions in the Loop:
- The loop continues as long as `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`.

### Current States:
- `i = (z + 1) // 2`
- `z` is an integer
- `j = z // 2`
- `p = 0 if i >= r else \min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `j + p + 1 < n`**
   - We need to ensure that `j + p + 1 < n`.
   - Currently, `j = z // 2`.
   - We need to check if `p` is such that `j + p + 1 < n`.

2. **Condition 2: `i - p - 1 >= 0`**
   - We need to ensure that `i - p - 1 >= 0`.
   - Currently, `i = (z + 1) // 2`.
   - We need to check if `p` is such that `i - p - 1 >= 0`.

### Adjusting the States:
- To make sure the first iteration of the loop executes, we need to adjust the states to satisfy both conditions.

#### Condition 1: `j + p + 1 < n`
- Since `j = z // 2`, let's denote `j = k` where `k = z // 2`.
- For `j + p + 1 < n` to hold, we need `k + p + 1 < n`.
- This implies `p < n - k - 1`.

#### Condition 2: `i - p - 1 >= 0`
- Since `i = (z + 1) // 2`, let's denote `i = m` where `m = (z + 1) // 2`.
- For `i - p - 1 >= 0` to hold, we need `m - p - 1 >= 0`.
- This implies `p <= m - 1`.

### Combining Both Conditions:
- We need to find a value of `p` that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.
- From the first condition: `p < n - k - 1` (where `k = z // 2`).
- From the second condition: `p <= m - 1` (where `m = (z + 1) // 2`).

### Conclusion:
- The value of `p` must be such that it satisfies both conditions.
- Since `p` is determined by the expression `0 if i >= r else \min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`, we need to ensure that this value is within the range that satisfies both conditions.

Given these constraints, we need to ensure that `p` is chosen appropriately. However, since the exact value of `p` is dependent on the conditions given, we cannot simplify it further without knowing the specific values of `r`, `res`, `l`, and `z`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is equal to `(z + 1) // 2`, `z` is an integer, `j` is `z // 2`, `p` must be such that `0 <= p < n - (z // 2) - 1` and `p <= (z + 1) // 2 - 1`**
