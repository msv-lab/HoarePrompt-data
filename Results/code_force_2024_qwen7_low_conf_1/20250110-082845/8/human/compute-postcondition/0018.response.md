Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i = (z + 1) // 2 \)
- \( z \) is an integer
- \( j = z // 2 \)
- \( p = p + 1 \)
- The condition \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) remains unchanged

### While Loop Condition:
```
while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Condition: \( j + p + 1 < n \)**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( j = z // 2 \) and \( p = p + 1 \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.
   - Therefore, \( j + p + 1 \) must be less than \( n \).

2. **Second Condition: \( i - p - 1 \geq 0 \)**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i = (z + 1) // 2 \) and \( p = p + 1 \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true.
   - Therefore, \( i - p - 1 \) must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjusting the States:

- To ensure the first condition \( j + p + 1 < n \) holds for the next iteration:
  - \( j \) remains \( z // 2 \).
  - \( p \) becomes \( p + 1 \).
  - We need \( z // 2 + (p + 1) + 1 < n \).

- To ensure the second condition \( i - p - 1 \geq 0 \) holds for the next iteration:
  - \( i \) remains \( (z + 1) // 2 \).
  - \( p \) becomes \( p + 1 \).
  - We need \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \).

### Summary of Adjusted States:

- The only state that needs adjustment is \( p \), as it has changed from \( p \) to \( p + 1 \).
- The condition \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) must remain unchanged.
- The condition \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \) must be satisfied for the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \(p + 2\), and the conditions \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) and \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \) must remain unchanged.**
