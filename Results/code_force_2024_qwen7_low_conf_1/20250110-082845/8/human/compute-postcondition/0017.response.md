`p` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is initially \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), and `p` must satisfy the condition \(z // 2 + p + 1 < n\). The condition regarding `s[j + p + 1]` and `s[i - p - 1]` does not affect the values of the variables since there is no conditional change for this case. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \(p + 1\), and the condition \(z // 2 + p + 1 < n\) remains unchanged.**
