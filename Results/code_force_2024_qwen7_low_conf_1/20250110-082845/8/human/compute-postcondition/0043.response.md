The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `p` is one more than its original value. The other conditions and variables such as `j + p + 2 < n`, and `i - p - 2 >= 0` still hold true.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `p` is increased by 1 (i.e., `p` = original value of `p` + 1), `j + p + 2 < n`, and `i - p - 2 >= 0`. If `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or switch statement. Since there is no else part, the same condition holds true if `s[j + p + 1] == s[i - p - 1]`.**
