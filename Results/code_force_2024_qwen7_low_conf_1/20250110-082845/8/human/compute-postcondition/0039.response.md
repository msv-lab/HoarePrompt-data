`p` is incremented by 1. The condition checking whether `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]` does not affect the value of `p`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string; `p` is increased by 1; if `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
