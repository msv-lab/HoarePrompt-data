Output State: **`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is the maximum value such that `0 <= p < n - (z // 2) - 1` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`, and the condition `j + p + 1 < n` must still hold.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`.
- Each iteration increments `p` by 1 and checks if the characters at positions `j + p + 1` and `i - p - 1` are equal.
- The loop breaks when these characters are not equal.
- After the loop ends, `p` will be the largest value that satisfies both conditions (`0 <= p < n - (z // 2) - 1` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`).
- The values of `i`, `z`, and `j` do not change during the loop, so they retain their initial values.
