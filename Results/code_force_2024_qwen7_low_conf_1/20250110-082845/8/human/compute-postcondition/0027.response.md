To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop's condition and the current state of the variables.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `z` in the range `2 * n - 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\)
   - `z` is an integer
   - `j` is \(z // 2\)
   - `p` is the maximum value such that \(0 \leq p < n - (z // 2) - 1\) and \(i - p - 1 \geq 0\) and \(j + p + 1 < n\) holds
   - If \(j + p > r\) holds, then `l` is set to `i - p`. Otherwise, the condition \(j + p > r\) does not hold; `res[z]` is now equal to `p`

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The variable `z` will increase by 1, so the new value of `z` will be \(z + 1\).
   - Calculate the new value of `i` as \((z + 2) // 2\).
   - Calculate the new value of `j` as \((z + 1) // 2\).

4. **Determine the New Value of `p`**:
   - `p` is determined based on the new values of `z`, `i`, and `j`. The condition \(0 \leq p < n - (z // 2) - 1\) and \(i - p - 1 \geq 0\) and \(j + p + 1 < n\) must still hold.
   - Additionally, if \(j + p > r\) holds, then `l` is set to `i - p`. Otherwise, `res[z + 1]` is now equal to `p`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes \((z + 2) // 2\)
- `j` becomes \((z + 1) // 2\)

Since `p` is recalculated based on these new values, it will be the new value of `p` for the next iteration. `l` and `res[z]` are not explicitly mentioned as needing adjustment, but their values may change based on the new `p`.

State: **`i` is \((z + 2) // 2\), `j` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `p` is the maximum value such that \(0 \leq p < n - ((z + 1) // 2) - 1\) and \(((z + 2) // 2) - p - 1 \geq 0\) and \(((z + 1) // 2) + p + 1 < n\) holds. If \(((z + 1) // 2) + p > r\) holds, then `l` is set to \((z + 2) // 2 - p\). Otherwise, the condition \(((z + 1) // 2) + p > r\) does not hold; `res[z + 1]` is now equal to `p`.**
