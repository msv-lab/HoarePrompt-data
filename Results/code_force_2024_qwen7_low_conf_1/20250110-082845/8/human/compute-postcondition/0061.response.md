The value of `p` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, the values of `i`, `j`, and `p` are defined in terms of `z`. Since `p` is the only variable that changes, the updated value of `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 - 1 + 1 + 1 = (z + 1) // 2 + 1\).

The conditions and comparisons involving other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 + 1\), and \(\frac{z}{2} < n - 1\) and \(\frac{z + 1}{2} - 1 \geq p\).

Output State: **`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 + 1\), and \(\frac{z}{2} < n - 1\) and \(\frac{z + 1}{2} - 1 \geq p\)**
