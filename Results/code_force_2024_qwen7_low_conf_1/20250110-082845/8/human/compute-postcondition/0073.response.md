The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. 

- Case_1: The program returns an empty list.
- Case_2: The program returns a list `res` of `2*n - 1` elements containing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `s`, and return either an empty list or a list of `2*n - 1` elements representing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`.
