`i` is initially equal to `(z + 1) // 2`, and `z` is an integer. The code `j = z // 2` assigns the value of `z // 2` to `j`. Since `z` is an integer, `j` will also be an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `(z + 1) // 2`, `z` is an integer, and `j` is `z // 2`.
Output State: **`i` is equal to `(z + 1) // 2`, `z` is an integer, and `j` is `z // 2`.**
