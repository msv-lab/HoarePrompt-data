The code `break` does not affect any variable values. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 + 1\), and \(n\) must be greater than \(z + 2.5\). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
