Postcondition: **`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 + (n - z - 2.5)\), `l` is \(-(n - z - 2.5)\), and `r` is \(n - 2.5\). If \(j + p > r\), then the condition is true, and no changes are made beyond the existing conditions. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the if part's condition is met.**
