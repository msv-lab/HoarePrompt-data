Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to \( (z + 1) // 2 \), `z` is an integer, `j` is \( z // 2 \), `p` must be such that \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \). If `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part in the if-else block.***
