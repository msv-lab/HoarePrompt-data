The value of `p` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `(z // 2 + 1)` to `(z // 2 + 2)`. The other variables (`i`, `z`, `j`, `p`, and the conditions involving `n`) remain unchanged as specified in the precondition.

Output State: **`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \(z // 2 + 2\), and the conditions \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) and \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \) remain unchanged. If `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`, these conditions persist as they were before the execution of the if statement.**
