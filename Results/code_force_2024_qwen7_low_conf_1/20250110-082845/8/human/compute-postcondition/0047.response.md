Postcondition: ***`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is the maximum value of `p` such that `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`, and the loop terminates when either `j + p + 1 >= n` or `i - p - 1 < 0` or `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]`. If the condition `(j + p) > r` is true, then `l` is `i - p`. Otherwise, `l` is \((z + 2) // 2 - p\).***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else conditions.
