Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is the maximum value such that `0 <= p < n - (z // 2) - 1` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`, and `j + p + 1 < n` holds. If `j + p > r` holds, then `l` is set to `i - p`. Otherwise, the condition `j + p > r` does not hold.***
