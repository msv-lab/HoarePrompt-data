The code snippet `i = (z + 1) // 2` updates the value of `i`. According to the initial state, `i` was defined as `(z_{prev} + 2) // 2` and `j` as `(z_{prev} + 1) // 2`. Now, `i` is redefined in terms of `z`.

- The previous value of `i` was \((z_{prev} + 2) // 2\).
- The new value of `i` is \((z + 1) // 2\).

The values of `j`, `p`, `res`, and `l` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \((z_{prev} + 1) // 2\), `p` is recomputed, `res` is updated such that `res[z_{next}]` is `p`, and `l` is \((z_{next} + 2) // 2 - p` if \((j + p) > r\), otherwise `l` is \((z_{next} + 2) // 2 - p\)**.
