Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length `n`, `res` is a list of `2 * n - 1` elements containing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`, `l` is the left boundary of the longest palindromic substring found during the loop, `r` is the right boundary of the longest palindromic substring found during the loop, `i` is always set to \((z + 1) // 2\) and `j` is set to \(z // 2\) for each iteration of the loop, and the loop executes exactly `2 * n - 1` times.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each possible center of a palindrome (from `0` to `2 * n - 2`) in the string `s`. For each center, it expands outwards to find the longest palindromic substring centered at that position.
- The variable `p` is incremented until the characters at positions `i - p - 1` and `j + p + 1` do not match or the bounds are exceeded.
- If the expanded substring extends beyond the current boundaries of `l` and `r`, these boundaries are updated to encompass the new longer palindromic substring.
- The result `res[z]` stores the length of the palindromic substring centered at the position `z`.

Since the loop iterates through all possible centers and updates the boundaries and result list accordingly, after the loop completes, `res` will contain the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`, and `l` and `r` will represent the boundaries of the longest palindromic substring found during the loop.
