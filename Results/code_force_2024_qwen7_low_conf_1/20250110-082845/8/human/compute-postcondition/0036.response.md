Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State:
- `i` is \((z + 1) // 2\)
- `j` is \(z // 2\)
- `p` is `p + 1`
- `l` is \((z + 2) // 2 - (p + 1)\) if \(((z + 1) // 2) + (p + 1) > r\) holds, otherwise `res[z + 1]` is equal to `p + 1`
- `j + (p + 1) + 1 < n` and `i - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0`

### `while` Loop Condition:
```
while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is \((z + 1) // 2\)
   - `j` is \(z // 2\)
   - `p` is `p + 1`
   - `j + (p + 1) + 1 < n` and `i - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0` are conditions derived from the current state.

3. **Loop Condition Check**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0` must hold true.
   - We already know `j + (p + 1) + 1 < n` and `i - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0` from the given state. This means that these conditions are already met.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `p` is updated to `p + 1`, the values of `i` and `j` remain the same in the context of the loop body.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `j + p + 2 < n` and `i - p - 2 \geq 0`.

5. **Required Adjustments**:
   - No adjustments are needed to the existing values of `i`, `j`, `p`, or `l` because the loop condition will naturally be satisfied due to the increment in `p`.

### Conclusion:
The state at the end of the previous iteration does not require any adjustments for the loop to execute one more time based on the given conditions.

**State:**
**`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is `p + 2`, `l` is \((z + 2) // 2 - (p + 2)\) if \(((z + 1) // 2) + (p + 2) > r\) holds, otherwise `res[z + 1]` is equal to `p + 2`, and `j + (p + 2) + 1 < n` and `i - (p + 2) - 1 \geq 0`**
