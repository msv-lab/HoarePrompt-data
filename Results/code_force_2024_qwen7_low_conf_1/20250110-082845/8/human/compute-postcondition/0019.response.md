The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. Given the conditions \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) and \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \) must remain unchanged, and since no variables are reassigned within the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `z`, `j`, `p`, and the conditions remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2\), `z` is an integer, `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \(p + 2\), and the conditions \( z // 2 + p + 1 < n \) and \( (z + 1) // 2 - (p + 1) - 1 \geq 0 \) remain unchanged.**
