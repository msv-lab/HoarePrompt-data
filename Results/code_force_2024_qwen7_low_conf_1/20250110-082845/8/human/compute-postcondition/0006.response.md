The initial state does not specify a value for `z`. Therefore, the value of `i` depends on the value of `z`. The expression `(z + 1) // 2` means `i` is assigned the integer division of `(z + 1)` by `2`.

Since `z` can be any integer, let's denote the value of `z` as `z_val`. Then the value of `i` would be:

- If `z_val` is even, then `(z_val + 1)` is odd, and the integer division by 2 will result in `i` being the floor of `(z_val + 1) / 2`.
- If `z_val` is odd, then `(z_val + 1)` is even, and the integer division by 2 will result in `i` being the floor of `(z_val + 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `z_val // 2 + 1`.

Given these conditions, we can summarize the impact:

- If `z` is even, `i = z // 2`.
- If `z` is odd, `i = (z + 1) // 2`.

However, without a specific value for `z`, we can only express `i` in terms of `z`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `(z + 1) // 2`, and `z` is an integer.**
