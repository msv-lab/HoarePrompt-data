The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Based on the initial state, `p` is equal to \((z + 1) // 2 + 1\). After the increment, `p` will be \((z + 1) // 2 + 2\).

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` remains untested because the code only modifies `p`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 + 2\), and \(n\) must be greater than \(z + 2.5\)**.
