The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. Since there are no loops or conditionals in the initial state that would be affected by this `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \((z + 1) // 2\), `j` is \(z // 2\), `p` is \((z + 1) // 2 - 1 + 1\), and \( \frac{z}{2} < n - 1 \) and \( \frac{z + 1}{2} - 1 \geq p \) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
