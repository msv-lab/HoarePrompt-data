You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A string t is said to be k -good if there exists at least one
substring^\dagger of length k which is not a palindrome^\ddagger . Let f(t)
denote the sum of all values of k such that the string t is k -good.

You are given a string s of length n . You will have to answer q of the
following queries:

  * Given l and r (l < r ), find the value of f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) . 

^\dagger A substring of a string z is a contiguous segment of characters from
z . For example, "\mathtt{defor} ", "\mathtt{code} " and "\mathtt{o} " are all
substrings of "\mathtt{codeforces} " while "\mathtt{codes} " and "\mathtt{aaa}
" are not.

^\ddagger A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
For example, the strings "\texttt{z} ", "\texttt{aa} " and "\texttt{tacocat} "
are palindromes while "\texttt{codeforces} " and "\texttt{ab} " are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number
of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the
string s only contains lowercase English characters.

The next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ).

It is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) .

Note

In the first query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaab} .
\mathtt{aaab} , \mathtt{aab} and \mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .

In the second query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaa} . There
are no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .

In the first query of the second test case, the string is \mathtt{abc} .
\mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{bc} and \mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good and 3 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{abc}) = 2 + 3 = 5 . Note that even
though there are 2 non-palindromic substrings of length 2 , we count it only
once.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate `f(s_l...s_r)` for the given range. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the calculation of non-palindromic substrings of various lengths within the specified range. 

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 1
  pqpcc
  1 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```

- Actual Output (from the provided program):
  ```
  5
  ```

The program calculates the value of `f` incorrectly. It seems to miss counting the correct number of non-palindromic substrings of different lengths. The program might be over-simplifying the logic or not correctly identifying non-palindromic substrings of specific lengths within the given range. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
