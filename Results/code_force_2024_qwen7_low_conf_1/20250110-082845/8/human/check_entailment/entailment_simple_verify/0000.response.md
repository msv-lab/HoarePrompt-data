### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `p1` and `p2` which are used to find the last occurrence of a non-palindromic character from the end and from a distance of 2 characters, respectively.
   - These arrays are filled in reverse order, starting from the end of the string. This ensures that `p1[i]` gives the last index where the substring starting at `i` and ending just before the next character is non-palindromic, and similarly for `p2`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in the string `s`.
   - It uses a center expansion approach to find the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at each index.
   - The result is stored in the array `res` where `res[z]` gives the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at position `z`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the length of the substring `s_l...s_r`.
   - It then checks if the last occurrence of a non-palindromic character from the start (`p1[l]`) is within the range `[l, r]`. If so, it prints `0` because all substrings of this length are palindromic.
   - If `p2[l]` is within the range `[l, r-1]`, it calculates the sum of all possible non-palindromic substrings using the formula `k * (k + 1) / 2` where `k` is half the length of the substring.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of substrings and subtracts the number of palindromic substrings.

Given these steps, let's re-evaluate the program against the provided example:

#### Example Analysis:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  5 1
  pqpcc
  1 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  14
  ```

- **Program Output (Incorrect):**
  ```
  5
  ```

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - `p1` and `p2` are computed for the string "pqpcc":
     - `p1`: [5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0]
     - `p2`: [5, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0]

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For the range `1 5`:
     - Length of the substring is `5 - 1 + 1 = 5`.
     - `p1[0] = 5` (last non-palindromic character is at index 0), but since `p1[0] >= 5`, it prints `0`.

However, the expected output is `14`, which means the program should be calculating the correct number of non-palindromic substrings.

#### Key Issues:
- The program incorrectly handles the case where `p1[l]` is within the range `[l, r]`. It should instead check if the substring starting at `l` and ending at `r` contains any non-palindromic substrings.
- The logic for calculating the number of non-palindromic substrings is overly simplified and does not account for all possible substrings.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate `f(s_l...s_r)` for the given range and misses several cases, leading to incorrect outputs.
