### Reasoning:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program correctly precomputes `p1` and `p2` arrays to store the positions of mismatches in the string from right to left and from right to two steps left, respectively. This helps in quickly determining the longest non-palindromic prefix up to a certain point.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the way `p1` and `p2` are computed. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < n and s[i] != s[i + 1]:` and `if i + 2 < n and s[i] != s[i + 2]:` might not cover all cases where a mismatch occurs. This could lead to incorrect results if there are mismatches but the conditions are not met.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each query to calculate the value of \( f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) \) efficiently using the precomputed arrays.
   - The logic for handling different cases (using `p1` and `p2`) seems sound but requires further validation.

3. **Palindrome Detection:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the Z-array (a variant of the Z-function), which indicates the longest palindromic prefix starting at each position in the string. This helps in determining if there are any palindromic substrings of a certain length within the query range.
   - The implementation of the Z-array is generally correct, but the use of `p1` and `p2` needs to be verified.

4. **Logic for Queries:**
   - If the mismatch point (`p1`) is beyond the query range, the substring is considered k-good for all possible k, so the result is 0.
   - If the mismatch point (`p2`) is beyond the second last character of the query range, the program calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to half the length of the substring.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the Z-array to determine the impact of palindromic substrings and adjusts the total sum accordingly.
   - The logic for adjusting the total sum based on the Z-array is correct, but the initial checks for `p1` and `p2` need to be validated.

5. **Edge Cases and Guarantees:**
   - The code handles edge cases appropriately and respects the constraints provided.
   - However, the correctness of the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2` is crucial. If these arrays are not correctly computed, the entire program can produce incorrect results.

Upon closer inspection of the annotated code, the original assessment did not fully address the potential issues with the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`. While the overall structure and logic seem correct, the detailed implementation of `p1` and `p2` could lead to incorrect results if there are mismatches that are not properly captured.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program may produce incorrect results due to potential issues in the precomputation of `p1` and `p2` arrays. Therefore, the original assessment should be overturned.
