Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `f(s_l ... s_r)`**:
   - The program uses the variables `p1` and `p2` to identify the positions where non-palindromic substrings start. However, these variables do not correctly capture the required information to compute `f(s_l ... s_r)`.
   - Specifically, `p1[i]` and `p2[i]` are intended to indicate the farthest non-palindromic prefix ending at position `i`. However, the logic for setting these values is flawed. For example, the condition `if i + 1 < n and s[i] != s[i + 1]:` should correctly identify positions where a non-palindromic substring starts, but the current implementation does not fully achieve this.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` computes the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in the string `s`. While this is a step towards solving the problem, it is not directly used in the main logic to compute `f(s_l ... s_r)`.
   - The main logic incorrectly assumes that `p1[l]` and `p2[l]` can be used to determine the values of `k` for which `s_l ... s_r` is `k-good`. However, these variables are not correctly set up to reflect the required information.

3. **Misinterpretation of Palindrome Checks**:
   - The main logic incorrectly checks if `p1[l] >= r` and `p2[l] >= r - 1` to determine if the substring is `k-good`. These checks do not correctly reflect the requirement of having at least one non-palindromic substring of length `k`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Identify the positions where non-palindromic substrings start.
- Use these positions to calculate the values of `k` for which the substring is `k-good`.
- Sum these values to get the result.

Here's a brief outline of how the program could be corrected:
1. Identify the positions where non-palindromic substrings start using dynamic programming or similar techniques.
2. Use these positions to determine the values of `k` for which the substring is `k-good`.
3. Sum these values to get the result for each query.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly meet the problem requirements, hence the correctness is **False**.
