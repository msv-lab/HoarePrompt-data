Reasoning:
1. The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating \( f(t) \) for a given substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r \).
2. The `func_1` function correctly computes the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in the string \( s \), which is necessary for determining the value of \( f(t) \).
3. The main loop in the program processes each query and uses the results from `func_1` to compute the required values. Specifically:
   - It checks if any non-palindromic substrings exist within the specified range.
   - It uses the precomputed palindromic substring lengths to determine the sum of all valid \( k \) values.

Given the detailed explanation in the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. The program does not have any logical errors based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
