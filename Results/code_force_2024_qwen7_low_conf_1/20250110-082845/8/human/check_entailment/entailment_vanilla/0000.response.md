Reasoning:
1. **Preprocessing:** The program correctly precomputes `p1` and `p2` arrays using dynamic programming to store the positions of mismatches in the string from right to left and from right to two steps left respectively. This helps in quickly determining the longest non-palindromic prefix up to a certain point.
2. **Query Processing:** The program processes each query to calculate the value of \( f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) \) efficiently using the precomputed arrays.
3. **Palindrome Detection:** The `func_1` function correctly computes the Z-array (a variant of the Z-function) which indicates the longest palindromic prefix starting at each position in the string. This helps in determining if there are any palindromic substrings of a certain length within the query range.
4. **Logic for Queries:**
   - If the mismatch point (`p1`) is beyond the query range, the substring is considered k-good for all possible k, so the result is 0.
   - If the mismatch point (`p2`) is beyond the second last character of the query range, the program calculates the sum of arithmetic series from 1 to half the length of the substring.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the Z-array to determine the impact of palindromic substrings and adjusts the total sum accordingly.
5. **Edge Cases and Guarantees:** The code handles edge cases appropriately and respects the constraints provided.

Given the detailed checks and logic, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
