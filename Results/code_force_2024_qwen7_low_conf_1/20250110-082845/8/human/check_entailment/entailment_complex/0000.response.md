Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function correctly handles the case when `n` is 0 by returning an empty list.
   - For non-zero `n`, the function correctly calculates the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position using Manacher's algorithm, which ensures that the algorithm runs in linear time.
   - The logic within the function is sound and correctly implements the algorithm.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The main program initializes arrays `p1` and `p2` which are used to find the boundaries of the longest non-palindromic substrings starting at each index.
   - The program correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` to get the list of palindrome lengths.
   - The logic to compute `f(t)` for the substring `s[l:r+1]` is correct. It uses the precomputed values from `p1` and `p2` to efficiently determine the sum of all values of `k` where the substring is `k-good`.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the output is as expected based on the provided examples.

Given that both the function `func_1` and the main program logic are correctly implemented and handle all specified cases, the overall correctness of the program is verified.

Correctness: **True**
