Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate `f(s_l...s_r)` for the given range. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the calculation of non-palindromic substrings of various lengths within the specified range. 

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 1
  pqpcc
  1 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```

- Actual Output (from the provided program):
  ```
  5
  ```

The program calculates the value of `f` incorrectly. It seems to miss counting the correct number of non-palindromic substrings of different lengths. The program might be over-simplifying the logic or not correctly identifying non-palindromic substrings of specific lengths within the given range. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
