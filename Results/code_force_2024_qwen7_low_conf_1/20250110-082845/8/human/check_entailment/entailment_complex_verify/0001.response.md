### Reasoning:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program correctly precomputes `p1` and `p2` arrays using dynamic programming to store the positions of mismatches in the string from right to left and from right to two steps left, respectively. This helps in quickly determining the longest non-palindromic prefix up to a certain point.
   
2. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each query to calculate the value of \( f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) \) efficiently using the precomputed arrays.
   - The logic for handling different cases based on the positions of `p1` and `p2` is correct. If `p1[l]` is beyond the query range, the substring is considered k-good for all possible k, so the result is 0. If `p2[l]` is beyond the second last character of the query range, the program calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from 1 to half the length of the substring.
   - The use of the `func_1` function to compute the Z-array is also correct, as it helps in determining the impact of palindromic substrings and adjusting the total sum accordingly.

3. **Palindrome Detection:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the Z-array, which indicates the longest palindromic prefix starting at each position in the string. This is crucial for determining if there are any palindromic substrings of a certain length within the query range.

4. **Edge Cases and Guarantees:**
   - The code handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `p1[l]` or `p2[l]` is beyond the query range.
   - The program respects the constraints provided, ensuring that it works within the limits of the input sizes.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there are a few potential issues and clarifications needed:

- **Handling of Mismatch Points (`p1` and `p2`):**
  - The logic for handling `p1` and `p2` seems to be correct, but there might be a slight oversight in how the final adjustment for the impact of palindromic substrings is made. Specifically, the line `if pal[l + r] >= length // 2:` might need a more precise condition to ensure it correctly accounts for the longest palindromic substring affecting the sum.

- **Final Adjustment Calculation:**
  - The calculation `ans -= length` when `pal[l + r] >= length // 2` might not be entirely correct. The exact length of the longest palindromic substring should be taken into account rather than subtracting the entire length.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the code and the logic, the overall approach and the handling of edge cases seem to be correct. However, there is a minor potential issue with the final adjustment calculation for the impact of palindromic substrings.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program appears to correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement, with a minor potential issue noted above.
