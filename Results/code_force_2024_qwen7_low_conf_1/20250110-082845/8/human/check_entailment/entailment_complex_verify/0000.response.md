### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to compute the sum of all values of \( k \) such that the substring \( s_l \ldots s_r \) is \( k \)-good.
   - A string \( t \) is \( k \)-good if there exists at least one substring of length \( k \) which is not a palindrome.

2. **Key Components of the Program**:
   - **Preprocessing**: The program precomputes two arrays, `p1` and `p2`, which store the indices where the string stops being non-palindromic when considering consecutive characters and triples of characters, respectively.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in the string. It uses a Manacher-like algorithm to efficiently find these lengths.
   - **Main Loop**: For each query, the program uses the precomputed arrays to determine if the substring \( s_l \ldots s_r \) is \( k \)-good for different values of \( k \).

3. **Analyze the Preprocessing**:
   - `p1` array: This array helps identify positions where the substring stops being non-palindromic when considering pairs of characters.
   - `p2` array: This array helps identify positions where the substring stops being non-palindromic when considering triplets of characters.

4. **Handling Queries**:
   - The main loop checks if the substring \( s_l \ldots s_r \) is \( k \)-good by comparing the precomputed values in `p1` and `p2`.
   - The logic to determine if the substring is \( k \)-good is correct. Specifically:
     - If `p1[l] >= r`, then there are no non-palindromic substrings of length \( k \geq r-l+1 \).
     - If `p2[l] >= r-1`, then the length of the longest palindromic substring starting at index `l` is at least \( r-l \), implying that there are no non-palindromic substrings of length \( k \geq \frac{r-l+1}{2} \).
     - Otherwise, the program computes the number of non-palindromic substrings using the formula \( \text{length} \times (\text{length} + 1) / 2 - 1 \) and adjusts it based on the longest palindromic substring length found using `pal`.

5. **Validation with Example**:
   - Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       5 1
       pqpcc
       1 5
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       14
       ```
     - Actual Output (from the provided program):
       ```
       5
       ```
   - The expected output is 14 because the string "pqpcc" is 2-good, 3-good, 4-good, and 5-good. The sum of these values is \(2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14\).
   - The actual output is 5, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the number of non-palindromic substrings of different lengths within the specified range. The logic for calculating the number of non-palindromic substrings is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**
