### Reasoning:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - The preprocessing step correctly computes the `p1` and `p2` arrays. `p1` is used to find the longest non-palindromic prefix ending at each position from right to left. `p2` is similar but considers every second character.
   - The logic for computing `p1` and `p2` is sound and efficient, leveraging the properties of palindromes.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each query efficiently using the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`.
   - The handling of edge cases where `p1` or `p2` exceeds the query range is correct, resulting in a zero output as expected.

3. **Palindrome Detection:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the Z-array, which is a variant of the Z-function. However, the problem statement does not require this exact computation. Instead, the problem can be solved more directly by checking for the presence of non-palindromic substrings of various lengths.
   - The Z-array is overkill here since the problem can be solved by simpler means, such as sliding window techniques or direct substring checks.

4. **Logic for Queries:**
   - The logic for determining the value of \( f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) \) is mostly correct but overly complex. The key observation should be that if a non-palindromic substring of length \( k \) is found within the range, then \( k \)-good values start from \( k \).
   - The current implementation uses the Z-array to determine the impact of palindromic substrings, which is unnecessary and complicates the solution.

5. **Edge Cases and Guarantees:**
   - While the code handles some edge cases correctly, it may fail in scenarios where the logic for handling `p1` and `p2` is not fully robust. Specifically, the calculation of `ans` might not account for all possible k-good values accurately.

### Conclusion:

While the code does handle the problem correctly in most cases, the use of the Z-array and the complexity in calculating the results can lead to errors in edge cases. The original assessment overstates the correctness of the implementation without recognizing these potential issues.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is generally correct but overly complex and potentially prone to edge-case errors. A simpler approach could directly check for the presence of non-palindromic substrings of various lengths within the query range.
