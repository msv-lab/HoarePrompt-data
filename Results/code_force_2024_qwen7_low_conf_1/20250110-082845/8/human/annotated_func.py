    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length `n`, `res` is a list of `2 * n - 1` elements containing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`, `l` is the left boundary of the longest palindromic substring found during the loop, `r` is the right boundary of the longest palindromic substring found during the loop, `i` is always set to \((z + 1) // 2\) and `j` is set to \(z // 2\) for each iteration of the loop, and the loop executes exactly `2 * n - 1` times.
    return res
    #`The program returns a list 'res' of 2*n - 1 elements containing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in 's'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`) and `s` (a string consisting of lowercase English letters). It returns either an empty list or a list of `2*n - 1` elements. This list contains the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`.

- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- Otherwise, the function iterates through each position in the string `s` and calculates the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at that position. It stores these lengths in the list `res`, which has a length of `2*n - 1`.

The function covers the following edge cases:
- When `n` is 0, it correctly returns an empty list.
- For non-zero values of `n`, it correctly identifies and records the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at each position in `s`.
