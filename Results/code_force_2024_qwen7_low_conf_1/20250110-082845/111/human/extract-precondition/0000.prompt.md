You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: Patrick calls a substring^\dagger of a binary string^\ddagger good if this
substring contains exactly one 1.

Help Patrick count the number of binary strings s such that s contains exactly
n good substrings and has no good substring of length strictly greater than k
. Note that substrings are differentiated by their location in the string, so
if s = 1010 you should count both occurrences of 10.

^\dagger A string a is a substring of a string b if a can be obtained from b
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the
beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.

^\ddagger A binary string is a string that only contains the characters 0 and
1.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
2500 , 1 \leq k \leq n ) — the number of required good substrings and the
maximum allowed length of a good substring.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2500 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of binary strings s
such that s contains exactly n good substrings and has no good substring of
length strictly greater than k . Since this integer can be too large, output
it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

    1 1
    
    3 2
    
    4 2
    
    5 4
    
    6 2
    
    2450 2391

Output

    1
    3
    5
    12
    9
    259280854
    
Note

In the first test case, the only suitable binary string is 1. String 01 is not
suitable because it contains a substring 01 with length 2 > 1 .

In the second test case, suitable binary strings are 011, 110 and 111.

In the third test case, suitable binary strings are 101, 0110, 0111, 1110, and
1111.
