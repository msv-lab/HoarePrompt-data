#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2500 and 1 <= k <= n, and the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 2500.
def func_1(n, k):
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[1][1] = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element `dp[i][j]` (for `1 <= i <= k` and `1 <= j <= n`) is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{i-1}{j-1}\) modulo `MOD`, starting with `dp[1][1] = 1` and remaining unchanged otherwise.
    result = sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1)) % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2500` and `1 <= k <= n`, and returns the value `dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`. The function initializes a 2D list `dp` of size `(k+1) x (n+1)` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[1][1]` which is set to 1. It then iterates through the `dp` table, filling it according to the binomial coefficient formula \(\binom{i-1}{j-1}\) for each cell `dp[i][j]` using dynamic programming. After populating the `dp` table, the function calculates the final result as the sum of the last row of the `dp` table, i.e., `sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k+1))`, modulo `MOD`. This final result represents the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) for all relevant combinations. The function handles all specified constraints and ensures that the sum of all `n` values over all test cases does not exceed 2500.
