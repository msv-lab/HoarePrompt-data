Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to count the number of binary strings \( s \) such that \( s \) contains exactly \( n \) good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than \( k \). A good substring here is defined as a substring containing exactly one `1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The provided code uses a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` ending with a `0` and having exactly `j` good substrings.
   - However, the current implementation seems to deviate from the correct dynamic programming formulation for this problem.

3. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The `dp` table is not correctly initialized or updated to reflect the count of binary strings ending with either `0` or `1` while maintaining the constraints.
   - The transition logic in the nested loops does not correctly account for ensuring the maximum length constraint (`k`) and the exact count of good substrings (`n`).

4. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - We need to maintain a separate `dp` array where `dp[j]` will store the number of binary strings of length up to the current position that have exactly `j` good substrings and do not have any good substring longer than `k`.
   - We iterate through each possible string length up to `n` and update the `dp` array based on the addition of `0` or `1` while ensuring the constraints are met.

Given these observations, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. It appears to be missing key components necessary to handle the constraints and accurately compute the required counts.

Correctness: **False**
