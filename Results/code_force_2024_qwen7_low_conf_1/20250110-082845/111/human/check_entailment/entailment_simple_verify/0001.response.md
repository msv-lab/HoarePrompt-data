### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task requires counting binary strings of length \( n \) that contain exactly \( n \) good substrings (substrings with exactly one `1`) and do not have any good substring of length strictly greater than \( k \).
   - The provided code attempts to use dynamic programming to solve this problem but seems to be misinterpreting the problem constraints and transitions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The `dp` table is intended to store the number of binary strings of a certain length that have a specific number of good substrings.
   - However, the current implementation initializes and updates the `dp` table incorrectly, leading to an incorrect solution.

3. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`, but the logic inside the loops does not correctly handle the constraints of good substrings and the maximum length \( k \).
   - The inner loop updates the `dp` table based on the previous states, but it does not ensure that the number of good substrings is exactly \( n \) and that no good substring exceeds length \( k \).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the `dp` table is being used to store sums of binomial coefficients, but these sums do not directly correspond to the number of valid binary strings with the required properties.
   - Specifically, the line `result = sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1)) % MOD` suggests an attempt to sum the relevant entries in the `dp` table, but the initialization and updating of the `dp` table are flawed.

5. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - A correct solution would involve initializing a `dp` array where `dp[j]` represents the number of binary strings of length up to the current position that have exactly `j` good substrings and do not have any good substring longer than \( k \).
   - Proper transitions should be made when adding `0` or `1` to the string while ensuring the constraints are maintained.

Given the analysis, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem due to the misinterpretation of the `dp` table and the logic within the loops. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
