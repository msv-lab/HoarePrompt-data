Reasoning:
1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is correctly initialized with dimensions `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` and all values set to 0, except for `dp[1][1]` which is set to 1. This initialization aligns with the problem requirements.
3. **DP Table Filling**: The nested loops correctly fill the `dp` table using the binomial coefficient formula \(\binom{i-1}{j-1}\) modulo `MOD`. The inner loop iterates over possible lengths of good substrings (`i`), and the outer loop iterates over the number of good substrings needed (`j`).
4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is computed by summing the relevant entries in the last row of the `dp` table, which corresponds to the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) for all relevant combinations. This calculation is done modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.
5. **Output**: The function correctly outputs the result for each test case, and the main program structure ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all constraints and requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
