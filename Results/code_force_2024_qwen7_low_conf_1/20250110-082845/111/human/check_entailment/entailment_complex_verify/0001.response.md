### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task is to count the number of binary strings \( s \) such that \( s \) contains exactly \( n \) good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than \( k \).
   - A good substring is defined as a substring containing exactly one `1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The provided code uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The idea is to build a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` with exactly `j` good substrings.
   - The code initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is used to keep track of the count of valid binary strings of length `i` with `j` good substrings.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The code initializes the DP table with all elements set to 0 and sets `dp[1][1] = 1` because a string of length 1 with exactly one `1` is a valid good substring.
   - It then iterates through the lengths from 2 to `k` and updates the DP table based on the previous row values. Specifically, `dp[i][j]` is computed as the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` (appending a `0`) and `dp[i-1][j-1]` (appending a `1`), taking into account the modulo operation to ensure the values stay within bounds.

4. **State of the Program**:
   - After the nested loops, the `dp` table is filled with the number of valid binary strings of each length up to `k` with exactly `j` good substrings.
   - The final result is the sum of the last row of the `dp` table from `dp[1][n]` to `dp[k][n]`, which gives the total number of valid binary strings of length up to `k` with exactly `n` good substrings.

5. **Annotations Validation**:
   - The annotation correctly describes the initialization and the update rules for the DP table.
   - The final result calculation is also correctly described as the sum of relevant entries in the `dp` table, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution for the given problem. It correctly initializes the DP table and updates it to ensure the constraints are met.
   - The final result calculation is also correct, summing the relevant entries in the `dp` table to get the total count of valid binary strings.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it properly implements the dynamic programming solution to count the number of binary strings with exactly \( n \) good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than \( k \).
