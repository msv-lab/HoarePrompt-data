Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros. The initial condition `dp[1][1] = 1` sets the base case for the binomial coefficient calculation.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Filling**:
   - The nested loops iterate through the `dp` table, updating each cell based on the previous values.
   - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, the value is calculated as the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]`, modulo `MOD`. This corresponds to the recursive relationship of binomial coefficients \(\binom{i-1}{j} = \binom{i-2}{j} + \binom{i-2}{j-1}\).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is computed as the sum of the last row of the `dp` table, i.e., `sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k+1))`, modulo `MOD`. This sum represents the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) for all relevant combinations.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The entire computation is performed modulo `998244353`, ensuring that the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Test Cases Handling**:
   - The program processes each test case independently, making sure to handle multiple test cases as described.

Given the execution summary, the program accurately implements the logic to compute the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. The approach uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the required binomial coefficients and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
