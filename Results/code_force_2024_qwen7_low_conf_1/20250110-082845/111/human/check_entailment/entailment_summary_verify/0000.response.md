### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to count the number of binary strings of length `k` that contain exactly `n` good substrings (containing exactly one '1') and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

#### Provided Solution Analysis:
- The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of binary strings that satisfy the conditions.
- The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` with exactly `j` good substrings.
- The transition rule in the `dp` table is defined by:
  - `dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD`
- This transition rule essentially means that to form a string of length `i` with `j` good substrings, we can either:
  - Extend a string of length `i-1` with `j` good substrings by appending a '0' (no change in the number of good substrings).
  - Extend a string of length `i-1` with `j-1` good substrings by appending a '1' (adding one good substring).

However, the original assessment points out that this transition rule does not enforce the constraint that no good substring can be longer than `k`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Transition Rule**: The transition rule does not differentiate between good substrings of length 1 and those of length greater than 1. This means it might count strings that violate the constraint of having no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

2. **Example Counter-Example**: Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the correct answer should be 3, as the valid binary strings are "0110", "0111", and "1100".
   - However, the program might incorrectly count strings like "0011" which has a good substring of length 3 (which is not allowed).

To address these issues, the solution needs to ensure that each new character added to the string either maintains the count of good substrings or introduces a new good substring of length 1 without extending any existing good substring beyond length `k`.

#### Corrected Approach:
- One way to enforce the constraint is to use a different dynamic programming approach that keeps track of the positions of the '1's in the string and ensures no good substring exceeds length `k`.

Given the function summary and the provided code, the current implementation does not correctly enforce the constraint of having no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not enforce the constraint that no good substring has a length strictly greater than `k`.
