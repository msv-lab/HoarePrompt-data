Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The goal is to count the number of binary strings \(s\) such that \(s\) contains exactly \(n\) good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than \(k\).
   - A good substring is defined as a substring containing exactly one '1'.
   - The count should be modulo \(998244353\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to compute the number of binary strings. However, the logic for constructing these strings is flawed.
   - The `dp` array is initialized such that `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length \(i\) with exactly \(j\) good substrings ending at position \(i\). 
   - The update rule `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` does not correctly reflect the problem constraints.
   - Specifically, this update rule does not ensure that no good substring has a length greater than \(k\), nor does it count the exact number of good substrings.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, you would need to use combinatorial methods and ensure that the constraints (exactly \(n\) good substrings and no good substring of length > \(k\)) are met.
   - A correct solution would involve more complex combinatorial counting and potentially generating functions or recursive methods to accurately count the valid binary strings.

### Example Cases:
- For \(n = 1\) and \(k = 1\), the only valid string is "1", which is correctly counted.
- For \(n = 3\) and \(k = 2\), the valid strings are "011", "110", and "111", but the program incorrectly counts other strings.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and therefore is incorrect.
