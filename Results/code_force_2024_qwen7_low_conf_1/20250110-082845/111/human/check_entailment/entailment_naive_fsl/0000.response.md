Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming but has a logical error. Specifically, the transition in the DP table `dp[i][j]` does not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem. The current implementation calculates the number of binary strings with exactly `j` good substrings of length up to `i`, but it does not ensure that no good substring has a length strictly greater than `k`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - The correct answer should be 3, as the valid binary strings are "0110", "0111", and "1100".
  - However, the program will incorrectly count other strings like "0011" which has a good substring of length 3 (which is not allowed).

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. The transition in the DP table should ensure that no good substring exceeds length `k`.
2. The current implementation allows the DP table to grow beyond the required constraints, leading to incorrect counts.

A corrected approach would involve ensuring that each new character added to the string either maintains the count of good substrings or introduces a new good substring of length 1 without extending any existing good substring beyond length `k`.
