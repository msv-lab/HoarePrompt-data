`dp[i][j]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the code updates the value of `dp[k + 1][j]` for `j` from 2 to `n` to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k + 1`; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[k + 1][j]` (for `j` from 2 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[k + 1][j]` (for `j` from 2 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD**.
