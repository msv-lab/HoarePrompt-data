According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and its upper limit `n`. The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1` and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`.

At the start of the current iteration, `j` is `1` because the loop starts from `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be within the range of `1` to `n + 1`. Since we don't know the exact value of `n` from the given information, we can only assume that `j` will increment by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`.

Given that `j` starts at `1` and the loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `2`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`, `j` is `2`**
