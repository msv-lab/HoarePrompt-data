`dp[i][j]` is assigned the value `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `2`, and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`. Since `j` is `2`, `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` translates to `dp[(k + 1) - 1][2 - 1]`, which simplifies to `dp[k][1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[k][1] + dp[k][1]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `2 * dp[k][1] % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `2`, `dp[i][j]` is `2 * dp[k][1] % MOD`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`**
