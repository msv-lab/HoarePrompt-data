The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is dependent on the previous row (`i - 1`) and column (`j` and `j - 1`). Since the initial state specifies that `i = k + 1` and `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is updated according to the given formula, we can infer that this update affects the entire row `i` of the `dp` table starting from `j = 2` (since `j` must start from 2).

Given that the initial state is:
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[i][j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`

After running the code snippet, the output state will be:
- `i` remains `k + 1`
- `dp` is updated such that for every `j` from 2 to `n`, `dp[k + 1][j]` is set to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[k + 1][j]` (for `j` from 2 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD**.
