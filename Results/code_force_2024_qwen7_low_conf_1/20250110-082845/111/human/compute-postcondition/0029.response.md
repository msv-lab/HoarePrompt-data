The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2500 and 1 <= k <= n, and the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 2500. The function returns `dp[k][n]`, which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers within specified ranges, and returns `dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`.**
