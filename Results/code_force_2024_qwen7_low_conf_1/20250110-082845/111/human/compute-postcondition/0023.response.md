Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[k + 1][j]` (for `j` from 2 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD`

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Current Iteration**: We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop variable `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - In each iteration, the value of `j` is incremented by `1`.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop starts at `j = 1` and increments by `1` each time, the value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1` from the current iteration.
   - The value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration will be `n` (since it stops at `n + 1`).

6. **New State**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `n + 1`.
   - The `dp` list remains unchanged as the loop variable `j` does not affect the `dp` list directly; it only updates elements based on the values of `dp[k][j]` and `dp[k][j - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is still `k + 1` (unchanged).
- `dp` remains the same 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[k + 1][j]` (for `j` from 2 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[k][j] + dp[k][j - 1]) % MOD**
