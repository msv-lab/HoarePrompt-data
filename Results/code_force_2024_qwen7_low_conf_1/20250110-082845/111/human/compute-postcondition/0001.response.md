`dp[1][1]` is assigned the value `1`. This updates the specific element in the 2D list `dp`. The size and initial values of the 2D list `dp` remain unchanged, and the value of `n` and `k` also remain the same as per the initial state.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2500`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.**
