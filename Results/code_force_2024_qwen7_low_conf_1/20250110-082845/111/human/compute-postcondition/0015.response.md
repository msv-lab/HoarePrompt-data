Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `j` is `2`
   - `dp[i][j]` is `2 * dp[k][1] % MOD`
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Currently, `j` is `2`.

4. **Next Iteration of the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently `2`, it needs to be incremented to `3` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop is only modifying `j`.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be updated during the loop body, but we need to determine the new `j` value for the next iteration.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains `k + 1`.
   - `j` changes to `3`.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be updated during the loop body, but the exact value is not specified here. We just need to know that the loop will use this new `j` value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `3`**
