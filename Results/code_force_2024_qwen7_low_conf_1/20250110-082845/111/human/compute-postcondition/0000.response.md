The code initializes a 2D list `dp` where each row contains `n + 1` zeros. The length of each row is `k + 1`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 2500` and `1 <= k <= n`, the `dp` list is initialized accordingly. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is 0, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2500`, and `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.**
