The code snippet updates the `dp` 2D list according to the given formula for all \( j \) up to \( j_{prev} + 1 \). Given the initial conditions and the formula:

- `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) \% MOD`
- `dp[1][1]` is `1`
- `j` is \( j_{prev} + 1 \)

This means that for the current `i`, the value of `dp[i][j]` is calculated using the previous row's values. However, since no specific values for `i`, `j`, or `MOD` are provided, we can only express the general update rule.

For all \( j \) from \( 1 \) to \( j_{prev} + 1 \):

- `dp[i][j]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) \% MOD`

No specific values are given for `i`, `j`, or `MOD`, so we cannot provide concrete numerical values for `dp[i][j]`. The output state includes the updated values of the `dp` 2D list based on the given formula, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size \((k + 1) \times (n + 1)\), where each element `dp[i][j]` for \( j \) up to \( j_{prev} + 1 \) is updated to \((dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) \% MOD`\)**
