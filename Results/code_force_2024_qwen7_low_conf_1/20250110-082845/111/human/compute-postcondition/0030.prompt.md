You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2500 and 1 <= k <= n, and the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 2500.
def func_1(n, k):
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[1][1] = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`, where each element `dp[i][j]` (for `1 <= i <= k` and `1 <= j <= n`) is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{i-1}{j-1}\) modulo `MOD`, starting with `dp[1][1] = 1` and remaining unchanged otherwise.
    result = sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1)) % MOD
    return result
    #`The program returns dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, where both are integers within specified ranges, and returns `dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: `The program returns dp[k][n]` which is the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\) modulo `MOD`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
