The code snippet updates the 2D list `dp` using the given formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` for all `j` up to `j + 1`. Since the initial state is specified and the formula does not change the overall structure or size of `dp`, we need to understand how the values are updated.

Given:
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)`
- Each element is updated according to the formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` for all `j` up to `j + 1`
- `dp[1][1]` is `1`

Since the code snippet itself does not specify any particular values for `i` and `j`, it applies the formula for all `i` and `j` in the range of the 2D list. However, without specific values for `i` and `j`, we can't pinpoint exact values for the elements. The formula will recursively apply the values from the previous row to the current row, updating each element according to the given formula.

The only explicit information provided is that `dp[1][1]` is `1`. All other values are updated based on the formula, but since the formula is applied to all elements in the 2D list, we cannot determine specific values without further context.

Therefore, the output state remains as the initial state with the understanding that each element in `dp` has been updated according to the formula.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element is updated according to the formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD` for all `j` up to `j + 1`, and `dp[1][1]` is `1`.**
