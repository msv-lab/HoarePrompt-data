`dp[i][j]` is assigned the value `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. The value of `i` is `k + 1`, and the value of `j` is `3`. Since `dp` is a two-dimensional array, the values of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` are needed to calculate the new value of `dp[i][j]`, but their specific values are not provided. However, we know that `i - 1` is `k` and `j - 1` is `2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `3`, `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[k][3] + dp[k][2]) % MOD`.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `j` is `3`, `dp[i][j]` is `(dp[k][3] + dp[k][2]) % MOD`**
