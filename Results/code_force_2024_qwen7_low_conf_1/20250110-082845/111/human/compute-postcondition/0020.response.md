Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`; `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where each element `dp[i][j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n`) is updated to `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. The initial values of `dp[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i - 1][j - 1]` are the sum of binomial coefficients up to `j` in the previous row, modulo `MOD`.**
