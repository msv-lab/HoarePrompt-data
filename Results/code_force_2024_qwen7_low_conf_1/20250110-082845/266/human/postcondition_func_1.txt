The function `func_2` accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even, and a list `grid` of two strings, where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">". For each of the `t` test cases, the function reads the value of `n` and `grid`, then calls `func_1(n, grid)`. If `func_1(n, grid)` returns `True`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function ensures that all inputs are within their specified constraints and handles each test case independently. Potential edge cases include invalid inputs (e.g., `t` or `n` outside their ranges, or `grid` strings not having the correct length or containing invalid characters). If any of these edge cases occur, the function will still proceed with the next test case if applicable.
