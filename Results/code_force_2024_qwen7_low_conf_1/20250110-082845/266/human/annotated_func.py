#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `i` is the last odd integer less than `n` if the loop executes at least once, the loop checks each odd index from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) to see if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` and both are less than `<`. If any such condition is met, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two strings `a` and `b`, both of length `n` and composed of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, the function checks whether there exists an odd index `i` (1-based) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 (the smallest allowed value), or when the input strings contain only one type of character ('<' or '>').
