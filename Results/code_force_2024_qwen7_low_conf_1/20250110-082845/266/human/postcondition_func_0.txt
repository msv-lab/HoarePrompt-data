The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two strings `a` and `b`, both of length `n` and composed of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, the function checks whether there exists an odd index `i` (1-based) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 (the smallest allowed value), or when the input strings contain only one type of character ('<' or '>').
