Postcondition: ***`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`), `queue` includes the tuple `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` if the condition `dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)` is satisfied. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, and no other changes occur.***
