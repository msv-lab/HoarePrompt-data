The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the cell `(nx, ny)` is marked as visited in the `visited` list.

- `directions` remains unchanged: `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` remains unchanged: an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` remains unchanged: a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is updated: the cell `(nx, ny)` is now marked as `True`
- `queue` remains unchanged
- `nx` is updated: `nx` is now `x + dx`
- `ny` is updated: `ny` is now `y + dy`

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False` and the cell `(nx, ny)` is `True`, `queue` is unchanged, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.**
