Postcondition: ***`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is either 1 or unchanged, `nx` is either `x + dx` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y + 1` or `y + 0`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where one element is `False` and the rest are `True` or all elements are `True` except for `visited[nx][ny]` which is `True`, `queue` contains the first element plus `(nx, ny)` or `(nx, ny)` as its last element if `dx` is 1, and `grid[nx][ny]` is either `'>'` or not "<" or `dy` is not `-1`. Additionally, if `grid[nx][ny]` is `<` and `dy` is `-1`, `nx` and `ny` are updated according to `dx` and `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`, and the tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to `queue`.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all possible outcomes after the if-else block execution are covered.
