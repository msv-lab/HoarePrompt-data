The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. Based on the previous values of the variables:

- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`.
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`.

Therefore, the `queue` list is modified to include the new coordinates `(nx, ny)`, and the `visited` list is updated at the position `[nx][ny]` to `True`.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`), `queue` is modified and now includes `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.**
