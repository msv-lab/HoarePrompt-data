The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the variables `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, the initial values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `nx` and `ny` without additional information.

Given the initial state:
- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`
- `queue` does not contain the first element

Since `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not defined, the output state will not specify the values of `nx` and `ny`, but will note that they have been updated based on the provided formula.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` does not contain the first element.**
