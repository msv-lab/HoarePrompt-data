The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. Given that `nx` is `x` and `ny` is `y + 1`, this means that the element in the `visited` list at the position `[x][y + 1]` is now marked as `True`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `visited[x][y + 1]` is `True`**.
