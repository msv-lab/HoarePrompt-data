Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `b` is a new string input received from the user.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a string input received from the user.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 until it is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Loop Body**: If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.

4. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1.
   - We need to check the condition for `i = 1`:
     - Check if `i + 1 < n`: Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, and we need `2 < n`.
     - Check if `a[1] == b[2] == '<'` or `a[1] == b[0] == '<'`:
       - If `a[1]` matches either `b[2]` or `b[0]` and both are equal to '<', then the program prints 'No'.
       - If neither condition is met, no change is made to the variables.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 from its current value of 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 (since `i += 2`).
   - To allow the loop to execute again, `i + 1` (which is 4) must be less than `n`.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1, but now `i` will be 3, so `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` becomes 3.

**Final State**:
State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 3**
