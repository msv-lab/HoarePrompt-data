`queue` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)`. The value of `nx` is `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is `y + dy`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
