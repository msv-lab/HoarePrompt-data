`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will receive a string input from the user. The value of `b` remains a string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, and `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`, and `a` is a string input received from the user.

Output State: **`b` is a string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`, and `a` is a string input received from the user.**
