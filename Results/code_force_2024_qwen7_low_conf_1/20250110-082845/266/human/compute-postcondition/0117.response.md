Postcondition: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is either 1 or -1, `dy` remains unchanged, `nx` is either `x + 1` or `x - 1`, `ny` is `y + 0`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True` except for `visited[nx][ny]` which is `True`, `queue` contains `(nx, ny)` as its last element if `dx` is 1, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` in both cases.**
