The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` sets the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the cell `(nx, ny)` has now been marked as visited. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, `queue` is modified (one element is removed), `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`, `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.**
