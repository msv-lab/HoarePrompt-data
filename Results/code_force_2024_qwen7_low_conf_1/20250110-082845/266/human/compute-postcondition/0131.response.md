Postcondition: ***`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, if `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1` or `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. `visited` and `queue` remain unchanged in other cases.***
