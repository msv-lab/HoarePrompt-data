Postcondition: ***`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, unless `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, in which case `queue` contains `(nx, ny)` and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.***
