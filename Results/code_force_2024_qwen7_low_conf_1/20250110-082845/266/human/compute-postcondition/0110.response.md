Postcondition: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` does not contain the first element, and `nx` is within the range [0, 2) and `ny` is within the range [0, n) and `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>`' and `dy` is `1`**
