The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. Given the initial conditions:

- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`
- `queue` is modified
- `nx` is `x`
- `ny` is `y + 1`

The variable `visited[nx][ny]` is updated to `True`, meaning that the cell `(nx, ny)` in the `visited` grid is now marked as visited.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False` and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `queue` is modified, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1**
