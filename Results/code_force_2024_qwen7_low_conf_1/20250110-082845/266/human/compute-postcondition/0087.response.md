The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x` and `y` and the direction specified by `dx` and `dy`. However, the initial values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Given that the current `(dx, dy)` is `(0, 1)`, the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` will be `x + 0` and `y + 1` respectively. Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we can represent `nx` as `x` and `ny` as `y + 1`.

The states of other variables (`directions`, `n`, `grid`, `visited`, `queue`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1`**.
