Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, `i` is `k + 2` where `k + 1 < n`, and both `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` must be false. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs.***
