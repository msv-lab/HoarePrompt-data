To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they change with each iteration. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.

### Initial Conditions at the Start of the Loop:
- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`
- `queue` is initially empty or contains some elements based on the initial conditions
- `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`
- `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`

### Loop Body:
The loop iterates over `directions` which are the possible movement directions (up, down, left, right).

### State Adjustments:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition inside the loop needs to be satisfied. The primary condition for the loop to continue is that there should be unvisited cells in the grid.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `directions` remains `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
   - `n` remains the same \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `grid` remains a list of two strings of length `n` consisting of "<" or ">".
   - `visited` remains a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`.

2. **Queue and Movement**:
   - `queue` gets modified in the loop body. It might contain an additional element `(nx, ny)` if the character at position `(nx, ny)` in `grid` is "<" and `dy` is `-1`, otherwise `visited[nx][ny]` is marked as `True`.
   - `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`.
   - `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, there must be unvisited cells in the grid. This means there should be at least one cell that is still `False` in the `visited` list.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the primary condition is that there must be unvisited cells in the grid. If all cells are visited, the loop will terminate.

### Updated State:
- `directions` remains `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` remains the same \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` remains a list of two strings of length `n` consisting of "<" or ">".
- `visited` remains a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (or at least one of them is `False`).
- `queue` is modified based on the loop body execution.
- `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current positions and directions.

Since we don't know the exact modifications made by the loop body, we can only state that there must be unvisited cells in the grid for the loop to continue.

### Final Answer:
State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`), `queue` is modified, `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`, `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`.**
