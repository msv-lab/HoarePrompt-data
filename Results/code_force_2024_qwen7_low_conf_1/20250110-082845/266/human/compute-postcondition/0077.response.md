The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. Based on the given information, `nx` and `ny` are updated using `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`, where `(dx, dy)` is taken from the list `directions`.

The initial state includes:
- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`
- `queue` is unchanged
- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`

After executing the code snippet:
- `queue` is updated by appending `(nx, ny)` to it.
- `nx` and `ny` remain updated as `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`.
- All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is `[original queue items, (nx, ny)]`, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`**.
