Postcondition: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 1, and if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.**
