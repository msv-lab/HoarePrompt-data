The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it processes input data typically provided through standard input or another external source. The function handles multiple test cases, where for each test case:
- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is read, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, two strings of length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even) are read, each consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.

After processing all the test cases, the function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases based on the specified constraints and handle strings of characters '<' and '>' without returning any specific value.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases based on specified constraints, handling strings of characters '<' and '>' for each test case, and does not return any specific value.**
