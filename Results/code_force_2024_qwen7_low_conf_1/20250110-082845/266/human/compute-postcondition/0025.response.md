The code prints 'No', but this does not affect the values of the variables. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 1, and the program prints 'No'.**
