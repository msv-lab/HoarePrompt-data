The code `break` is executed within a loop or conditional statement, which causes the loop or conditional to exit. However, since no loop or conditional statement is explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, we assume this is part of a larger context where such a statement would terminate the loop or conditional.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `b` is a string input received from the user
- `i` is \( i + 2 \)
- Both `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` must be false

Since `break` is used, the loop or conditional is terminated without further changes to the variables. The output is 'No', but this does not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, `i` is \( i + 2 \), and both `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` must be false.**
