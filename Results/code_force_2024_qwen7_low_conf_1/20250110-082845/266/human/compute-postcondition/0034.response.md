The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no such loop or switch statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
