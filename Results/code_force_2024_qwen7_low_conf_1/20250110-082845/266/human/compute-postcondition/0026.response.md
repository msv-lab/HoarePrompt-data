The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the current block of code, which does not affect the values of the variables outside of this block. Therefore, the values of `b`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the print statement 'No' is executed.

Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 1, and the program prints 'No'**
