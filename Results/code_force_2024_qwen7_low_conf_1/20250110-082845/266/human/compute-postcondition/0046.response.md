According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 starting from 1 up to but not including `n`. The condition for continuing the loop is `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 1
- `a` is a list of characters
- `b` is a list of characters

For the loop to continue executing one more time:
1. The value of `i` must be such that `i + 1 < n`. Since `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, `i + 1` would be 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.
2. Given `i = 1`, the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` do not affect the continuation of the loop since they are evaluated for `i = 1` and `i = 3` (if `n` were 3). However, since we are ensuring the loop continues, we don't need to change the values of `a` and `b` based on these conditions; we just need to ensure `i` is odd and `i + 1 < n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` must be 3 (the next odd number after 1)

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3**
