The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` updates the `visited` list at the position `[nx][ny]` to `True`. Given that `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, these new coordinates are now marked as visited. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`)
- `queue` is modified
- `nx` is updated to `x + dx`
- `ny` is updated to `y + dy`
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`), `queue` is modified, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True**
