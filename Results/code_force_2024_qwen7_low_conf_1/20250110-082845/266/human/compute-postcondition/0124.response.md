The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. From the initial state, we know that `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`. The `queue` is unchanged except for this new element.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is updated such that `visited[nx][ny] = True`, `queue` has `(nx, ny)` appended to it.**
