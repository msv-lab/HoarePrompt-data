`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5; `t` is now the integer input received from the user.**
