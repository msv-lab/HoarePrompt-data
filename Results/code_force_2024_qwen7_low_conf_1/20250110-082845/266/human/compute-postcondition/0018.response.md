Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, and the loop checks each odd index from 1 to \( n-1 \) (inclusive) to see if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` and both are less than `<`. If any such condition is met, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.**
