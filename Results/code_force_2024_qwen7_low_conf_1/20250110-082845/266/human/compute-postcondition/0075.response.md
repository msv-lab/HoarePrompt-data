The code updates the variables `nx` and `ny` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`. However, the initial values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `nx` is updated to `x + dx` and `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False` (at least one of them must be `False`), `queue` is modified, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`.**
