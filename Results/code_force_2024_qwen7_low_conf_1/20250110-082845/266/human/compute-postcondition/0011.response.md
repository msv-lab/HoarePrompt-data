The code snippet `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console but does not change the values of any variables. The initial conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, `i` is `k + 2` where `k + 1 < n`, and both `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` must be false.**
