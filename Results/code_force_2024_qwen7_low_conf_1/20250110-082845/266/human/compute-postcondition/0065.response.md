The code snippet appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This means that the value of `queue` changes, but no other specific variables are affected. The previous values of `nx`, `ny`, and `queue` are updated, and the `visited[nx][ny]` is marked as `True`.

Given the initial state:

- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`
- `queue` is modified (one element is removed)
- `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`
- `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`

After executing the code snippet, the only new information is that the tuple `(nx, ny)` has been appended to `queue`. The rest of the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, `queue` is modified (one element is removed) and contains an additional element `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`, `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`**.
