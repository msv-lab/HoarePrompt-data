State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is the integer input received from the user**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` indicates that the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. The value of `t` is mentioned as being the integer input received from the user, but it is currently in the form of a variable, not an actual integer.
4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a valid integer input that falls within the specified range.

Since the problem statement already mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and is the integer input received from the user, no additional adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring `t` is within the given bounds.
