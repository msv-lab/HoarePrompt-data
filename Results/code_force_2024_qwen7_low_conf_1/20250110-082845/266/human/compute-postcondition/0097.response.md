Postcondition: ***`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1`: if `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` and `(not visited[nx][ny])`, the `queue` is appended by `(nx, ny)` under the conditions: 
- `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`,
- `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1` or `dx == 1` and `dy == 0` or `dx == -1` and `dy == 0`.
Otherwise, the `queue` remains unchanged.***
