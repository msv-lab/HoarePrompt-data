`visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`. This means that the cell `(nx, ny)` has been visited. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is such that `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `queue` is unchanged.**
