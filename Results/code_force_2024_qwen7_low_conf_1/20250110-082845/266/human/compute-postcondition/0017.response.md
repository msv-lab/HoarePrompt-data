Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, `i` is \( i + 2 \), and if `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then these conditions hold true. Otherwise, the conditions `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` remain false.***
