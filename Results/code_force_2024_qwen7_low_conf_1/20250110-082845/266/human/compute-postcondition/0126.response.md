The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the list `queue`. Given that `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, the tuple `(nx, ny)` is specifically `(x + dx, y + dy)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `visited` is unchanged, `queue` includes the tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`**
