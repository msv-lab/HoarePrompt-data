`visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`. The value of `visited[nx][ny]` is now `True`, and this updates the `visited` list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, except for the element at index `[nx][ny]` which is now `True`, `queue` is modified (one element is removed), `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`, `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`, the current position `(nx, ny)` is valid (i.e., \(0 \leq nx < 2\) and \(0 \leq ny < n\)) and has not been visited (i.e., `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`), `grid[nx][ny]` is not ">" or `dy` is not `-1`, the if condition `dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)` is true.**
