Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n` and it increments by 2 each time (`range(1, n, 2)`).

3. **Loop Iteration**:
   - In the current iteration, `i` is 3.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`, which means `3 < n` (since `n` is greater than 2).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `5` (since `i = 3 + 2`).

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The new value of `i` is 5.
   - The loop condition is still `i < n`, which means `5 < n`.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 2.
   - `i` changes to 5.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 5**
