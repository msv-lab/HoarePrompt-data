The code `print('No')` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `b`, or `i`. It simply prints 'No' to the console. The conditions involving the variable `a` are not relevant since `a` is not mentioned in the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user, `i` is \( i + 2 \), and both `a[i] != b[i + 1]` and `a[i] != b[i - 1]` must be false. Printed output is 'No'**
