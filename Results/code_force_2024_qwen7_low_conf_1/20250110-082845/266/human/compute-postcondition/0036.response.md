Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over odd indices starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. The loop checks if the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true. If this condition is met at any point, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'Yes'.

### Initial State
- `b` is a new string input received from the user.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the loop, so its value remains unchanged).
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`.
- `a` is a string input received from the user.

### Loop Execution

1. **First Iteration (`i = 1`):**
   - Check if `a[1] == b[2] == '<'` or `a[1] == b[0] == '<'`.
   - If either condition is true, break and print 'No'.
   - If not, continue.

2. **Second Iteration (`i = 3`):**
   - Check if `a[3] == b[4] == '<'` or `a[3] == b[2] == '<'`.
   - If either condition is true, break and print 'No'.
   - If not, continue.

3. **Third Iteration (`i = 5`):**
   - Check if `a[5] == b[6] == '<'` or `a[5] == b[4] == '<'`.
   - If either condition is true, break and print 'No'.
   - If not, continue.

This pattern continues until the loop reaches the end or breaks.

### Final State

- **If the loop does not break:**
  - The loop will continue until the highest possible `i` (which is `n-1` if `n` is even or `n-2` if `n` is odd) is checked.
  - Since the loop does not break, the program prints 'Yes'.
  - The values of `b`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.

- **If the loop breaks:**
  - The loop breaks when the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true for some `i`.
  - The program prints 'No' and exits the loop.
  - The values of `b`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states until the point where the condition was met.

### Conclusion

Since the loop can potentially run for all odd indices up to `n-1`, and the only change would be printing 'Yes' or 'No', the final state of the variables is determined by whether the condition is met during the loop execution.

**Output State:**
- `b` is a new string input received from the user.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`.
- `a` is a string input received from the user.
- The program will print 'Yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are true for any odd index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`. Otherwise, it will print 'No'.

**Final Output State:**
Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`, `a` is a string input received from the user, the program prints 'Yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are true for any odd index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, otherwise it prints 'No'.**
