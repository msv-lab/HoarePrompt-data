The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. The variables `nx` and `ny` are references to `x` and `y + 1` respectively. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified by appending `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1**
