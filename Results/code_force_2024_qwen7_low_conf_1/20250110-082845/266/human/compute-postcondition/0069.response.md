The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The `nx` and `ny` values are updated based on the current `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` values, ensuring the new position is valid and not visited before. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `directions` remains `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`.
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `grid` remains a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">".
- `visited` remains a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, except for the element at index `[nx][ny]` which is now `True`.
- `queue` has one additional element `(nx, ny)`.
- `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` values.
- `grid[nx][ny]` is not ">" or `dy` is not `-1`.
- The if condition `dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)` is true.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, except for the element at index `[nx][ny]` which is now `True`, `queue` is modified (now contains an additional element `(nx, ny)`), `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` values, `grid[nx][ny]` is not ">" or `dy` is not `-1`, the if condition `dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)` is true.**
