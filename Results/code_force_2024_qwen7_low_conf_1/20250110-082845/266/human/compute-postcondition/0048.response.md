The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement present in the code, the variables `n` and `i` retain their initial values, and the `break` statement does not alter them. The only effect is that we break out of the hypothetical context in which this `break` statement might be placed.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
