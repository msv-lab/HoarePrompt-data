The code appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` is equal to `x` and `ny` is `y + 1`. Since `visited[x][y + 1]` is already `True`, this information remains unchanged. The `queue` and `visited` lists are updated, but their full states are not provided in the initial state, so only the specific changes are noted.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` has an additional element `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is `x`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `visited[x][y + 1]` is `True`**
