Postcondition: ***`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`. If the condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and (not visited[nx][ny])` is true, `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True` and `queue` may or may not include the tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`. If the condition is false, `visited[nx][ny]` remains `False`.***
