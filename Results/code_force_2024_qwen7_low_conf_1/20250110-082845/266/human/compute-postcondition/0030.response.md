The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and only indicates that a loop or match-case block has been exited. Since there are no loops or match-case blocks in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
