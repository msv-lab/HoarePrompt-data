Postcondition: ***`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified. If \(0 \leq nx < 2\) and \(0 \leq ny < n\) and `(not visited[nx][ny])` is true, then `queue` is `[original queue items, (nx, ny)]` and `visited[nx][ny]` is updated based on the grid and direction conditions. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `visited[nx][ny]` and the coordinates are updated accordingly.***
