The code appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the initial state, `nx` and `ny` are calculated as `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively, and `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`. The `queue` did not contain the first element before, and now it contains the new element `(nx, ny)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements except `visited[nx][ny]` are `True`, `queue` contains the first element plus `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is within the range [0, 2) and `ny` is within the range [0, n), and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. Additionally, the current value of `dy` is `-1` and `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`.
