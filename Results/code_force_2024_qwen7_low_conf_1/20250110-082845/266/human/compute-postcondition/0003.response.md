The code `a = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (which is a string) to the variable `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `a` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input received from the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `a` is the string input received from the user**
