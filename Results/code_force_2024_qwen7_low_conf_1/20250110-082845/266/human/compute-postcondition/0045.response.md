Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program prints 'No' and then breaks out of the program. Otherwise, nothing specific happens regarding the values of `n` and `i`, but the program continues execution without printing anything or breaking.**
