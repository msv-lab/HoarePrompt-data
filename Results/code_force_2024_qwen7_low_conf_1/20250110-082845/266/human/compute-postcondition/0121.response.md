Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is unchanged
- `y` is unchanged
- `dx` is unchanged
- `dy` is either 1 or unchanged
- `nx` is either `x + dx` or `x + 1`
- `ny` is either `y + 1` or `y + 0`
- `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"
- `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where one element is `False` and the rest are `True` or all elements are `True except for visited[nx][ny]` which is `True`
- `queue` contains the first element plus `(nx, ny)` or `(nx, ny)` as its last element if `dx` is 1, and `grid[nx][ny]` is either '>' or not "<" or `dy` is not `-1`.
- If `grid[nx][ny]` is '<' and `dy` is `-1`, `nx` and `ny` are updated according to `dx` and `dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`, and the tuple `(nx, ny)` is appended to `queue`.

### For Loop:
```python
for (dx, dy) in directions:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`. Since `directions` is a fixed list of tuples `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, the loop will iterate over these four directions.

2. **State Changes within the Loop**:
   - The direction `(dx, dy)` is chosen from `directions`.
   - `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the chosen direction.
   - Depending on the value of `grid[nx][ny]` and the conditions specified, further updates might occur to `nx`, `ny`, `visited`, and `queue`.

3. **Key Conditions for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are directions to process.
   - After processing a direction, the next direction is taken from the list.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the current state. To determine the next state, we need to consider the following:

- **Current Direction**: The last direction processed, say `(dx_last, dy_last)`.
- **Next Direction**: The next direction in the `directions` list.

Since `directions` is fixed and cyclic, the next direction in the list would be the one following `(dx_last, dy_last)` in lexicographical order. 

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- The direction `(dx_last, dy_last)` was processed.
- The next direction in the `directions` list would be `(0, 1)` if `(dx_last, dy_last)` was `(0, -1)`, `(1, 0)` if `(dx_last, dy_last)` was `(0, 1)`, etc.

### Final State for the Next Iteration:

- `x` remains unchanged
- `y` remains unchanged
- `dx` remains unchanged
- `dy` will be the next direction in `directions` list, so it will be the direction after `(dx_last, dy_last)`
- `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the new `(dx, dy)` value.
- `grid`, `visited`, and `queue` will remain consistent with the rules provided.

### Example Adjustment:

If `(dx_last, dy_last)` was `(0, 1)`:
- The next direction in the list is `(0, -1)`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is 0 or -1, `nx` is either `x + dx` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y + 1` or `y + 0`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged.**

To generalize, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is either `x + dx` or `x + 1`, `ny` is either `y + 1` or `y + 0`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged.**
