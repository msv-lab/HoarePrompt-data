Postcondition: ***`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change is applied to the variables.***
