Postcondition: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is 1, and either (`i + 1 < n` and `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is `<` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is `<`).**
