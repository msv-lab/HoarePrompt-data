`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, which converts the user's input into an integer. The previous value of `n` (which was an integer greater than 1) is replaced by the new input value. The variables `b` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer equal to `int(input())`**
