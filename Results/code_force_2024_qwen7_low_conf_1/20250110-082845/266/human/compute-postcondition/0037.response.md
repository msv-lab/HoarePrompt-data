Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t)`. This means the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Understand the Current State**: The problem statement mentions "State at the end of the previous iteration". However, it does not provide specific details about the values of variables or their conditions at the end of the previous iteration. For this example, we need to focus on the general behavior of the loop.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**: Since the loop uses `range(t)`, it will execute from `0` to `t-1`. If the loop has just completed its previous iteration, then the current iteration count would be `t-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The loop variable (the `_` in this case) would be incremented from `t-1` to `t`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that the value of `t` should be greater than the current loop counter. Since the loop just finished the previous iteration (`t-1`), for the next iteration to occur, the loop counter must be less than `t`.

Based on the above steps, we can adjust the states as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than `t-1`**

Since the condition for the loop to continue is that `t` should still be greater than the current loop counter, and the loop just finished with `t-1`, the condition remains that `t` must still be greater than `t-1` for the next iteration to occur.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than `t-1`**
