The code snippet `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables but adds a new element to the `queue`. The values of `directions`, `n`, `grid`, `visited`, `nx`, `ny`, and `queue` are updated as follows:

- `nx` and `ny` are updated based on the current `x` and `y` coordinates and their respective direction changes (`dx` and `dy`).
- `queue` now contains one more element, specifically the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Given the initial state, the output state is:
Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where the first element is `True` and the rest are `False`, `queue` contains one additional element `(nx, ny)`, `nx` is updated based on the current `x` and `dx`, `ny` is updated based on the current `y` and `dy`.**
