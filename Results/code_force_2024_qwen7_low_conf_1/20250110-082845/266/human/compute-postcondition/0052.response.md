The code `break` does not assign any new values to the variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no such loop or switch in the given initial state, the behavior is equivalent to simply exiting the current context. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the output remains 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 5, the output is 'No'**
