The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `grid`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">".

Output cases are as follows:
- Case_1: The program returns `True`.
- Case_2: The program returns `True`.
- Case_3: `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` does not contain the first element, `x` is the value of the first element's x-coordinate, `y` is the value of the first element's y-coordinate, the program returns `True`.
- Case_4: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `grid` as parameters, and based on specific conditions, return either `True` or `False`.
