Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` is modified (contains elements added based on the conditions specified in the loop), `x` is the final value of `x` after all iterations, `y` is the final value of `y` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the `directions` list, which contains four possible directions: right, left, down, and up.
- For each direction, it calculates the new coordinates (`nx`, `ny`) based on the current coordinates (`x`, `y`).
- It checks if these new coordinates are within the valid range and if they have not been visited.
- If the conditions are met, it marks the new coordinate as visited and appends it to the `queue`.
- The loop continues until there are no more valid unvisited neighbors to explore.
- Once the loop finishes, every valid cell in the `grid` that is reachable from the starting point `(0, 0)` will be marked as visited.
- The values of `x` and `y` will be the final coordinates after exploring all possible paths.

If the loop does not execute (which means there are no valid paths to explore), the `visited` list remains as initially set, with the first element of each sublist being `True` and the rest being `False`.
