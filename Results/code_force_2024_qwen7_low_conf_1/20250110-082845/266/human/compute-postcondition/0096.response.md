Postcondition: ***`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified: if `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, `queue` is appended by `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, `queue` is appended by `(nx, ny)` if `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1` or `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`. Otherwise, the `queue` remains unchanged.***
