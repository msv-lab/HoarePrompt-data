The code `print('No')` does not affect the values of the variables; it only prints a string to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`b` is a new string input received from the user, `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a string input received from the user, `i` is 5**
