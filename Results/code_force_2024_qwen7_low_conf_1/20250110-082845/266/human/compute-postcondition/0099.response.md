According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `queue` has been modified and contains elements added based on the conditions specified in the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `queue` is non-empty. Since the `queue` is modified within the loop, we cannot directly infer its contents without knowing the exact modifications made inside the loop body. However, we know that the loop will continue as long as `queue` is non-empty.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `queue` is non-empty for the next iteration.

State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` must be non-empty, `x` is the final value of `x` after all iterations, `y` is the final value of `y` after all iterations.**
