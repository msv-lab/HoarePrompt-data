Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a string input received from the user. If the current value of `i` satisfies `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is a '<' character or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is a '<' character, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues as usual.***
