`nx` and `ny` are updated by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`, respectively. The `visited[nx][ny]` variable is set to `True`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`**
