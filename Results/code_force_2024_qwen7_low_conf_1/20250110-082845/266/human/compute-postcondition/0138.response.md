The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. Since `dx` and `dy` are the next direction in the `directions` list, the values of `nx` and `ny` are updated accordingly. The `queue` was unchanged before this operation, but now it includes the new tuple `(nx, ny)`. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is updated such that `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `queue` contains the additional element `(nx, ny)`**
