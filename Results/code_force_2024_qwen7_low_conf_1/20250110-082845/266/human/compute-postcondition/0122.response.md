The code `nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy` updates the values of `nx` and `ny` by adding `dx` to `x` and `dy` to `y`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values for `nx` and `ny` are `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, `visited` is unchanged, `queue` is unchanged.**
