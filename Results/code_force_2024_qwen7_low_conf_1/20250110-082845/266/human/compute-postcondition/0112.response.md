The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given that `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy`, and knowing that `dy` is `1`, the value of `ny` is `y + 1`. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, `nx`, `directions`, `n`, `grid`, `visited`, and `queue` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where one element is `False` and the rest are `True`, `queue` contains the first element plus `(nx, ny)`, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>'.**
