The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and represents the integer input received from the user, the value of `n` will be the same as the value of `t`. The state of `t` is no longer relevant because it was replaced by `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input received from the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4**
