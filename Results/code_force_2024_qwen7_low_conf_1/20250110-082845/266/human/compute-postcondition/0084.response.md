Postcondition: ***`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is `[original queue items, (nx, ny)]`, `nx` is updated to `x + dx`, `ny` is updated to `y + dy`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, then `queue` is `[original queue items, (nx, ny)]`. Otherwise, if `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1` is not met, `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True` if `dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)` is true. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited[nx][ny]` and the coordinates are updated accordingly.***
