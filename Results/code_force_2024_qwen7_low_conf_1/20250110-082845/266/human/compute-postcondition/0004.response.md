`b` is assigned the value of the string input received from the user using `input()`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because no operation affects it directly. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `b` and retains the original value for `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input received from the user such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `b` is the string input received from the user**
