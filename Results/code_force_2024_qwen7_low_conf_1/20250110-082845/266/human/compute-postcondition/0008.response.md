The code `break` is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it exits the loop that the condition `i + 1 < n` suggests is being iterated over. However, since there is no explicit loop in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the loop is terminated. The values of the variables `n`, `b`, `i`, `a`, and `b[i+1]` or `b[i-1]` remain unchanged. The print statement 'No' is executed, but it does not affect the variable states.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `b` is the string input received from the user, the current value of `i` satisfies `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is a '<' character or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is a '<' character, we break out of the loop.**
