The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. Given that `nx` and `ny` are derived from the current position in the grid, and assuming that `nx` and `ny` are valid coordinates within the grid (which are checked by the condition `visited[x][y + 1]` being `True`), the only variable that changes is `queue`.

- The `directions`, `n`, `grid`, and `visited` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.
- `queue` now includes the new tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where at least one of them is `False`, `queue` is modified to include a new element `(nx, ny)`.**
