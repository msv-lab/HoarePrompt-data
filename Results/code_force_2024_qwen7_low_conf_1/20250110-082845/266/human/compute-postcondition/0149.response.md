Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) and `grid` (a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">"). The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to check if there is a path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (1, n-1) in the grid, where movement is restricted by the direction of the arrows ("<" or ">").

If the BFS reaches the bottom-right corner, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The BFS correctly handles the grid boundaries and only moves in the allowed directions ("<", ">", "right", "left").
- The function ensures that the `visited` matrix keeps track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
- If the grid configuration does not allow any valid path from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), the function correctly returns `False`.

The final state of the program after it concludes:
- If the function returns `True`, then there exists a valid path from (0, 0) to (1, n-1) following the arrow directions.
- If the function returns `False`, then no valid path exists from (0, 0) to (1, n-1) following the arrow directions.**

The program does not have any redundant annotations or missing functionality that significantly affect the outcome.
