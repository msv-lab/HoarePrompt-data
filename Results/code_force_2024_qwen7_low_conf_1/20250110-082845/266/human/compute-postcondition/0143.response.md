Postcondition: **`x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is the next direction in `directions` list, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is unchanged, `grid` is unchanged, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` if `grid[nx][ny]` is `'<>'` and `dy` is `-1` or `1`. Otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False` and `queue` may or may not include the tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)` depending on the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**
