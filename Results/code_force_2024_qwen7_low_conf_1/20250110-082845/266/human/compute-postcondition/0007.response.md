The code prints 'No', but does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change is in the output itself.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `b` is the string input received from the user, the current value of `i` satisfies `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is a '<' character or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is a '<' character, print('No')**
