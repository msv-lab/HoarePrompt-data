The code `x, y = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variables `x` and `y`. This impacts the `queue` by reducing its size by one. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, they are now set to the values of the element removed from the `queue`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial state:
- `directions` remains `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`.
- `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `grid` remains a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">".
- `visited` remains a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`.
- `queue` has its first element removed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` does not contain the first element, `x` is the value of the first element's x-coordinate, `y` is the value of the first element's y-coordinate.**
