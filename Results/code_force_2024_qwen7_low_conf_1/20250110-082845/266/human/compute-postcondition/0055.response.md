Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `i` is the last odd integer less than `n` if the loop executes at least once, the loop checks each odd index from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) to see if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` and both are less than `<`. If any such condition is met, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.**
