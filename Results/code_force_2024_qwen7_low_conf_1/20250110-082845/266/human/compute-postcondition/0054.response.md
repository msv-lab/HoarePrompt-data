Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the last odd integer less than `n`, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters. If for any `i` in the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) where `i` is odd, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` which is `<` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` which is `<`, the program prints 'No' and then breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, the program prints 'Yes' after the loop completes.**
