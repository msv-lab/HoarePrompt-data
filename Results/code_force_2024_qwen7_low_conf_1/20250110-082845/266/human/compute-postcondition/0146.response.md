Output State: **`directions` is `[(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters which are either "<" or ">", `visited` is a list of 2 sublists, each containing `n` elements where all elements are `True`, `queue` is empty, `x` is `1`, `y` is `n - 1**, if the condition `x == 1 and y == n - 1` is satisfied during the loop, the function returns `True` otherwise it returns `False`.
