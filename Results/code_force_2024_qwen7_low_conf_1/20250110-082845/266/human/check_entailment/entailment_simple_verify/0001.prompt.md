You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `i` is the last odd integer less than `n` if the loop executes at least once, the loop checks each odd index from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) to see if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` and both are less than `<`. If any such condition is met, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves checking if a robot starting at (1, 1) can reach (2, n) on a 2xN grid with arrows indicating movement direction. The robot can only move in specific patterns as dictated by the arrows.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**: The solution provided checks for a certain pattern of arrow directions to determine if the robot can reach the bottom-right corner.
   - It iterates through every odd index (column) up to `n-1`.
   - For each column, it checks if moving up to the corresponding column in the next row and following the arrow would prevent the robot from reaching the target.
   - If such a situation is detected, it prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such situation is detected, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: 
   - The input is checked for constraints (e.g., n is even, no arrows point outside the grid).
   - However, the solution does not fully address the problem requirements:
     - The solution incorrectly assumes the robot can only move in a specific pattern based on the arrow positions, which may not cover all scenarios.
     - The logic used might miss other valid paths or incorrectly identify invalid paths.
   - The solution fails to consider the complete path the robot could take, especially when there are mixed arrows that allow multiple directions of movement.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The provided solution is flawed because it does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). It makes assumptions about the movement pattern without considering all possible paths.
   - A more comprehensive approach would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid and verifying if the final position is (2, n).
