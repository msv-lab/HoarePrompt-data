You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `i` is the last odd integer less than `n` if the loop executes at least once, the loop checks each odd index from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) to see if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]` and both are less than `<`. If any such condition is met, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. If none of the conditions are met for all iterations, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two strings `a` and `b`, both of length `n` and composed of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, the function checks whether there exists an odd index `i` (1-based) such that either `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`. If such an index is found, the function prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such index is found after checking all possible indices, the function prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include when `n` is exactly 2 (the smallest allowed value), or when the input strings contain only one type of character ('<' or '>').
