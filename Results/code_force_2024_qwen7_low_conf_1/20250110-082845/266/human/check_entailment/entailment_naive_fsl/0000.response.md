Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions (i.e., when `i` is odd) and prints 'No' immediately if those conditions are met. However, the problem requires checking all possible paths the robot can take to reach the cell (2, n).

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
<>><
><><
```

In this case, the robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2) and then down to (2, 2).
3. Move right to (2, 3) and then down to (2, 4).

However, the program does not check this path because it only checks the condition when `i` is odd (i.e., `i = 1` and `i = 3`). It would incorrectly print 'No' for this input, as it fails to consider other possible paths.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
