### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is responsible for processing each test case. It correctly reads `n` and `t`, and then reads the characteristics of each message.
3. **Sorting**: The messages are sorted based on their `b_i` values, which is crucial for the sliding window approach.
4. **Sliding Window Approach**: The function uses a sliding window mechanism to find the maximum number of messages that can be read within the time limit `t`. This involves:
   - Adding the reading time of the current message (`a[r][0]`) to the current result (`res`).
   - If necessary, adjusting the window by removing messages from the left until the total time (`res`) does not exceed `t`.
   - Updating the answer (`ans`) with the maximum size of the valid window.
5. **Output**: The function correctly returns the maximum size of the set of messages that can be read within the given time limit.

The original assessment is largely correct. The provided code implements the required logic accurately, and the sliding window approach ensures that the maximum number of messages within the time limit is found efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and matches the requirements of the problem statement.
