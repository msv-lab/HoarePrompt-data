Reasoning:
1. The given program seems to have an incomplete `func_1` function where a block of code is commented out, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. We can safely ignore this part.
2. The main part of `func_1` correctly reads the input values `n` and `t`, sorts the messages based on their `b_i` values, and uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of messages that can be read within the time limit `l`.
3. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the sorted list of messages, adding the reading time and adjusting the window as needed to ensure the total time does not exceed `t`.
4. The logic for updating the answer `ans` with the maximum number of messages that can be read within the time limit appears to be correct.

Given these points, the implementation in `func_1` matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible size of the set of messages that can be read within the given time limit.

Correctness: **True**
