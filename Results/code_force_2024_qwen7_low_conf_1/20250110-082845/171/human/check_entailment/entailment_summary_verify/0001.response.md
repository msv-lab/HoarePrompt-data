### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of messages `n` and the time limit `t`, then reads the characteristics of each message.
   - It sorts the list `a` based on the second element of each sublist (`b_i`), which is a key requirement for the sliding window approach.

2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of messages that can be read within the time limit `t`.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the current window and a variable `res` to keep track of the cumulative reading time.
   - The while loop iterates through the sorted list, adding the reading time and the absolute difference between consecutive `b_i` values to `res`.
   - When `res` exceeds `t`, it adjusts the window by moving the left pointer `l` to the right and subtracting the corresponding values from `res`.
   - This ensures that the window always represents a valid set of messages that can be read within the time limit.

3. **Updating the Answer:**
   - The program updates the answer `ans` with the maximum length of the valid window found during the iteration.
   - After processing all messages, it returns `ans`, which represents the maximum possible size of the set of messages that can be read within the given time limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where no subarray meets the condition by ensuring that `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - The sliding window approach correctly accounts for the cumulative reduction in the sum of elements, ensuring that the total time does not exceed `t`.

Given these points, the implementation in `func_1` matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum possible size of the set of messages that can be read within the given time limit.

### Final Evaluation:
