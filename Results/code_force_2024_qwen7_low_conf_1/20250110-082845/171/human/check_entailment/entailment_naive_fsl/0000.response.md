Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the total time spent reading the messages according to the given formula. Specifically, the program sorts the messages based on their `b` values and then tries to find the maximum subset of messages whose cumulative reading time does not exceed `t`. However, the calculation of the reading time is incomplete.

The reading time for a set of messages should include the sum of `a_i` values and the sum of absolute differences between consecutive `b_i` values within the set. The current implementation only adds the `a_i` values and the difference between the last and the first `b_i` value, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 8
4 3
1 5
2 4
4 3
2 3
```

The correct output should be 3, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will incorrectly calculate the reading time and might not produce the correct result. This can be seen from the sorting and summation approach, which does not account for the full formula.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
