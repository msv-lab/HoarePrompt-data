Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations.

### Initial State:
- \( r + 1 < n \)
- \( res = \text{res\_original} + a[r][0] + (a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]) \)

### Loop Code:
```python
while res > t:
    res -= a[l][0]
    if l < n - 1:
        res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]
    l += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as \( res > t \).
   - Each iteration of the loop decreases \( res \) by \( a[l][0] \), and optionally by \( a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1] \).

2. **Final Condition:**
   - After the loop terminates, \( res \leq t \). This means the loop exits when \( res \) is no longer greater than \( t \).

3. **Final Values:**
   - Since the loop continues to subtract \( a[l][0] \) and optionally \( a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1] \), the final value of \( res \) will be such that \( res \leq t \).
   - The final value of \( l \) will be the point where the condition \( res \leq t \) is satisfied. If \( l \) reaches \( n - 1 \), the loop stops even if \( res > t \) because \( l \) cannot increment further.

4. **Final Value of \( res \):**
   - The exact value of \( res \) after the loop depends on the sequence of subtractions performed. However, we know that \( res \leq t \).

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop have executed, the following conditions will hold:
- \( r + 1 \leq n \) (since the loop exits when \( res \leq t \)).
- \( l \) will be the index just before or at the point where \( res \leq t \).
- \( res \) will be the value such that \( res \leq t \).

### Output State:
Output State: **\( r + 1 \leq n \), \( l \) is the index just before or at the point where \( res \leq t \), and \( res \) is the value such that \( res \leq t \)**.
