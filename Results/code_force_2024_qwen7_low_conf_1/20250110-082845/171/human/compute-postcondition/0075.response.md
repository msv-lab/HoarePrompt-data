`ans` is assigned the maximum value between `ans` and `r - l + 1`. The value of `r - l + 1` is updated, but the exact value depends on the current values of `r` and `l`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **\( r + 1 \leq n \), \( l \) is the index just before or at the point where \( res \leq t \), \( res \) is the value such that \( res \leq t \); `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( r - l + 1 \)**
