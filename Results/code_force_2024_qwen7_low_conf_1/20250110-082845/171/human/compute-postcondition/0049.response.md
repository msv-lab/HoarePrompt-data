Postcondition: **`res` is greater than `t` after the update, `l` is increased by 1, `res` is adjusted according to whether `l` is less than `n-1`: if `l < n-1`, then `res` is updated to `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `t` remains unchanged. If `l` is not less than `n-1`, then no changes to `res` and `l` are made, and `t` remains unchanged.**
