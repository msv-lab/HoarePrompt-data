The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. According to the initial state, the condition involving `res` and `t` is dependent on whether `l` is less than `n - 1`. Since the value of `l` has been incremented, the new condition will depend on whether `l` is now less than `n - 1`. If `l` was equal to `n - 1` before the increment, the condition remains unchanged because `l` is still not less than `n - 1`. If `l` was less than `n - 1`, it is now exactly `n - 1`.

Output State: **`res` is equal to `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, which is still greater than `t` if `l < n - 1` and false if `l` is exactly `n - 1`.**
