`res` is initially greater than `t` after the update, `l` is increased by 1, and `res` is decreased by `a[l][0]`. The code updates `res` by subtracting `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` from it. 

Given the initial state:
- `res > t`
- `l` is increased by 1, so `l` is now `l + 1`
- `res` is decreased by `a[l][0]`, and now it is further decreased by `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`

Therefore, the new value of `res` is:
\[ \text{new\_res} = \text{res} - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]) \]
Simplifying this:
\[ \text{new\_res} = \text{res} - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1] \]

So, the updated values are:
- `res` is now `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]`
- `l` is `l + 1`
- `t` remains unchanged

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]`, `l` is `l + 1`, `t` is unchanged**
