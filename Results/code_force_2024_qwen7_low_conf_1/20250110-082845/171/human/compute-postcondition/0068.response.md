`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `r + 1` is still less than `n`, and `res` is updated to `res - a[l][1] + a[l + 1][1]`, which means the value of `l` before incrementing was less than `n - 1`. After incrementing, `l` is still less than `n - 1` because if `l` was equal to `n - 1` before the increment, it would become `n`, which is not less than `n`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r + 1 < n`, `res` is updated to `res - a[l][1] + a[l + 1][1]`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is updated to `res - a[l][1] + a[l + 1][1]`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`**
