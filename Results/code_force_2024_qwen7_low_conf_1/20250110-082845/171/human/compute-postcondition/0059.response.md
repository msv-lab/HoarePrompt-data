`res` is initially updated based on the values of `a[r][0]`, `a[r][1]`, and `a[r-1][1]`. The code then subtracts `a[l][0]` from `res`. The specific values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `res` is the original value of `res` minus `a[l][0]`.

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is updated to its original value plus `a[r][0]` and further updated by adding `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`, and `res` must be greater than `t`, `res` is now `res - a[l][0]`**
