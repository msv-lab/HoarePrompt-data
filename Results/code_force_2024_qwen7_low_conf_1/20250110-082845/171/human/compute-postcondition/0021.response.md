Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is 1. If `l < n - 1`, `res` is updated to `res - (a[l+1][1] - a[l][1])`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
