### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \)
   - \( a \) is a list of \( n \) sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist
   - \( \text{ans} = 2 \)
   - \( l \) is the smallest index such that \( \text{res} \leq t \)
   - \( r = 3 \)
   - \( \text{res} = \text{res} + a[2][0] + a[3][1] - a[2][1] \)

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as \( \text{res} > t \).
   - In each iteration, \( \text{res} \) is reduced by \( a[l][0] \) and optionally by \( a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1] \) if \( l < n - 1 \).
   - The loop ends when \( \text{res} \leq t \).

3. **Post-loop**:
   - \( l \) is updated until \( \text{res} \leq t \).
   - \( \text{res} \) is adjusted to be exactly \( t \).

4. **Final Expression**:
   - \( \text{ans} \) is updated to the maximum of its current value and \( r - l + 1 \).

### Final State Calculation:
- After the loop, \( \text{res} \) is exactly \( t \).
- \( l \) is the index just beyond the last sublist that was subtracted from \( \text{res} \) to make \( \text{res} \leq t \).
- Since \( r = 3 \), the expression \( r - l + 1 \) needs to be evaluated.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop terminates without reducing \( \text{res} \) below \( t \), \( l \) will be \( n \).
- Otherwise, \( l \) will be the index just beyond the last subtraction.
- \( \text{ans} \) will be the maximum of its initial value (2) and \( r - l + 1 \).

Given \( r = 3 \):
- \( \text{ans} = \max(2, 3 - l + 1) \)

Since \( l \) is determined by the loop and will be at least 3 (the loop starts from the smallest index making \( \text{res} \leq t \)), the value of \( r - l + 1 \) will be at most 1.

Therefore, the final value of \( \text{ans} \) will be 2 because \( \max(2, 3 - l + 1) \) will not exceed 2 given \( l \geq 3 \).

### Output State:
**Output State: \( t \) is the value of \( \text{res} \) after the loop, \( l \) is the index just beyond the last subtraction, and \( \text{ans} = 2 \).**
