`l` is incremented by 1, which means `l += 1`. Given that the initial condition was `l` is less than `n - 1`, after incrementing `l`, the new value of `l` should still satisfy this condition unless `l` was already equal to `n - 2`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `l` initially, we can only say that `l` is increased by 1.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is updated to its original value plus `a[r][0]` and further updated by adding `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`, and `res` must be greater than `t`, `res` is now `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, and the current value of `l` is less than `n - 1`; `l` is increased by 1.**
