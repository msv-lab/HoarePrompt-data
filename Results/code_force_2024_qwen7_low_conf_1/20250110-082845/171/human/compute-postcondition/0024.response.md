`res` is decremented by the value of `a[l][0]`. Given that `l` is initially 2, the value being subtracted from `res` is `a[2][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\) and \(n > 3\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `res` is such that `res - (a[3][1] - a[2][1]) > t` and `res` is decreased by `a[2][0]`.**
