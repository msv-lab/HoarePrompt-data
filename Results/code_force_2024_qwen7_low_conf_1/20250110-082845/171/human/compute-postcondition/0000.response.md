The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `t`, respectively. The initial values of `n` and `t` are specified in the range constraints, but their specific values are not known yet. The output state will include the updated values of `n` and `t` after reading from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, both `t` and `n` are assigned the values read from the input.**
