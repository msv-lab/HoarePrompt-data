`r` is incremented by 1, and the value of `t` remains unchanged since `r` was previously set to the value of `res` after the loop. The value of `l` also remains unchanged, and the value of `ans` remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the value of `res` after the loop, `l` is the index just beyond the last subtraction, and `ans` is 2; `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is the value of `res` after the loop, `l` is the index just beyond the last subtraction, and `ans` is 2; `r` is increased by 1.**
