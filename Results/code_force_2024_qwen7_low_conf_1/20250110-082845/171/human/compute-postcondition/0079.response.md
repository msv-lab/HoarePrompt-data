The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it seems to work with global variables or predefined inputs, specifically `t`, `n`, `l`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. However, based on the provided constraints and output description, we can infer the parameters indirectly.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
- `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq 10^9\).
- `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for each message \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

The function returns `ans`, which is the maximum length of a subarray within `a` such that the cumulative reduction in the sum of elements from the start of the array to the end of the subarray does not exceed `t`.
