Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `res` is either `a[1][0]` (if `r > 0`) or `a[1][0] + a[1][1] - a[0][1]` (if `r <= 0`).***
