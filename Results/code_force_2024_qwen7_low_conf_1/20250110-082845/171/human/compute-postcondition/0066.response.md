The code subtracts the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from `res`. Given the initial state, `l` is less than `n - 1`, so `l + 1` is a valid index within the bounds of the list `a`. The value of `res` is updated based on the difference between the second elements of the sublists at indices `l + 1` and `l`.

Let's denote the second elements of the sublists as follows:
- `a[l][1] = b`
- `a[l + 1][1] = c`

Therefore, the new value of `res` is `res - (c - b)`, which simplifies to `res - c + b`.

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is `res - a[l][1] + a[l + 1][1]`, `l` is less than `n - 1`**
