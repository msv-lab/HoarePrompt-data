According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res` and the constant `t`. If `res` is greater than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is unchanged and `l` is 3. The fact that `l` is 3 does not affect the condition for the loop to continue, but `res` must be greater than `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `res` remains unchanged, no additional state needs to be adjusted beyond ensuring that the condition `res > t` holds true for the next iteration.

State: **`res` is an integer such that `res > t`**
