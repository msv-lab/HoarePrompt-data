The code `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` subtracts the value of `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` from `res`. From the initial state, we know the following:

- `r + 1 < n`
- `res` is updated to its original value plus `a[r][0]` and further updated by adding `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`, and `res` must be greater than `t`, `res` is now `res - a[l][0]`.
- The current value of `l` is less than `n - 1`.

Let's break down the changes:

1. `res` is initially updated to include `a[r][0]` and `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`.
2. Then, `res` is adjusted by subtracting `a[l][0]`.
3. Now, `res` is further adjusted by subtracting `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `res` is the original value of `res` minus `a[l][0]` minus `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is updated to its original value plus `a[r][0]` and further updated by adding `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`, and `res` must be greater than `t`, `res` is now `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, and the current value of `l` is less than `n - 1`.**
