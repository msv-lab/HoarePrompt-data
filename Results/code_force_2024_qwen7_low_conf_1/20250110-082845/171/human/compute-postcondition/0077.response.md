Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is the maximum length of a subarray within `a` such that the cumulative reduction in the sum of elements from the start of the array to the end of the subarray does not exceed `t`, `l` is the left boundary index of the valid subarray, `r` is the right boundary index of the valid subarray, `res` is the sum of elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` that satisfies the condition `res \leq t`.**
