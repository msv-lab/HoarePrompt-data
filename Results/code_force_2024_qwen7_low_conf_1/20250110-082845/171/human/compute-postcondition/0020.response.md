The code subtracts the difference between the second elements of the sublists at indices `l + 1` and `l` from the variable `res`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the changes:

- `res` is initially set to `res - a[1][0]`, which means `res` already has a value based on the first sublist.
- The new operation updates `res` by subtracting `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.

Since `l` is initialized to 1, the code is essentially performing `res -= a[2][1] - a[1][1]`.

Given these points, we can update the state as follows:

- `res` is now `res - (a[2][1] - a[1][1])`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, `res` is `res - (a[2][1] - a[1][1])**.
