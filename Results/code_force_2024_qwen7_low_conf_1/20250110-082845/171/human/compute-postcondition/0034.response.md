Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 2, `l` is the smallest index such that `res \leq t`, `r` is 3, `res` is `res + a[2][0] + a[3][1] - a[2][1]`. If `r` is not greater than 0, `res` remains unchanged.***
