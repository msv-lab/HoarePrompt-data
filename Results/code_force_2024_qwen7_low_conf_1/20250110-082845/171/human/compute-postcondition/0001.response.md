The code initializes a list of lists `a` by reading `n` lines of input, each containing integers separated by spaces, and converting them into integers. Each line represents a sublist in the list `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\).
3. The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing space-separated integers.
4. Each line is converted to a list of integers.
5. These lists form the sublists of the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the integers read from the input are not specified, we can only say that `a` is a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input.**
