`res` is decreased by `a[l][0]`. The value of `res` was initially greater than `t`, but now it has been decreased by `a[l][0]`. The value of `a[l][0]` is unknown, but we know that the new value of `res` is `res - a[l][0]`, which is still greater than `t` since `res` was originally greater than `t` and we are subtracting a non-negative value from it.

Output State: **`res` is equal to `res - a[l][0]`, which is still greater than `t`**
