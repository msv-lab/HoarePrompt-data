The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The value of `res` and the conditions under which it was calculated previously are not directly affected by this line of code. The only variable that changes is `l`, which is now `l + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0]` minus either `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` or 0, and the result is still greater than `t`; `l` is increased by 1.**
