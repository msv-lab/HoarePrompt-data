`res` is decreased by the value of `a[l][0]`. The value of `a[l][0]` is unknown, but `res` was initially greater than `t`. The condition `r + 1 < n` and `l` being less than `n - 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `r + 1 < n`, `res` is now `res - a[l][0]`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`r + 1 < n`, `res` is `res - a[l][0]`, `l` is less than `n - 1`**
