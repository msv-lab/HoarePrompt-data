The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 2, so after executing the code, `l` will be 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\) and \(n > 3\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` is 1, `res` is `res - (a[3][1] - a[2][1])`.
