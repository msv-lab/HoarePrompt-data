The code updates the variable `res` by adding the difference between `a[r][1]` and `a[r-1][1]` to `res`. Given that `r + 1 < n` and `res` is updated to its original value plus `a[r][0]`, the output state will reflect these changes.

Let's denote the original value of `res` as `res_original`. After the first update, `res` became `res_original + a[r][0]`. Now, the second line of the code updates `res` further by adding `a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]` to it.

So, the new value of `res` is:
\[ \text{res} = \text{res\_original} + a[r][0] + (a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]) \]

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r + 1 < n`, `res` is `res_original + a[r][0] + (a[r][1] - a[r-1][1])`**
