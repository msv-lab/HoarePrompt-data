`res` is incremented by `a[r][0]`. Since `r` must be 1 (and not 0), the value of `res` becomes `a[1][0]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input, and `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `res` is `a[1][0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input, and `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `res` is `a[1][0]`**
