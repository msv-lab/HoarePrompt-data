The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input, and `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist; `ans` is 0**.
