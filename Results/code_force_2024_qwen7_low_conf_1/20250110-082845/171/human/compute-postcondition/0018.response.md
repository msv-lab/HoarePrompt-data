To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues. The loop continues as long as `res > t`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\)
- `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist
- `ans` is 0
- `l` is 1
- `r` is 1
- `res` is \(-a[0][0]\) if \(n \leq 2\) else \(-a[0][0] - a[2][1] + a[0][1]\)

The loop will continue as long as `res > t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `res` such that it becomes less than or equal to `t` for the loop to terminate.

Let's break down the possible values of `res`:

1. If \(n \leq 2\):
   - `res = -a[0][0]`

2. If \(n > 2\):
   - `res = -a[0][0] - a[2][1] + a[0][1]`

In both cases, `res` is dependent on the elements of the list `a`. Since the loop continues as long as `res > t`, we need to adjust `res` to be less than or equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `res` must be less than or equal to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and `res` must be less than or equal to `t**
