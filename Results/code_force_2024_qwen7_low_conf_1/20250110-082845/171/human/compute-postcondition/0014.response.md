Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `res` is `-a[0][0]`, `a[1][0]` must be less than or equal to `t`. The condition `(l < n - 1)` is true.***
