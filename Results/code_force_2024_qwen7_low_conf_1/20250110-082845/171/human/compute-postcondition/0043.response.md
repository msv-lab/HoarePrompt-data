`res` is initially `res - a[l][0]` and is still greater than `t`. The code subtracts `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` from `res`. Since `res` was previously `res - a[l][0]`, the new value of `res` will be updated to `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, which is still greater than `t`**
