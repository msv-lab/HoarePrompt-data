`r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \), `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 2, `l` is the smallest index such that `res \leq t`, `r` is 2, `res` is the accumulated reduction starting from the initial value of `res` until the condition `res \leq t` is met.**
