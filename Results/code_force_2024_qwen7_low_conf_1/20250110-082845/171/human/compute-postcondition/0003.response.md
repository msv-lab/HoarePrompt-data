The code sorts the list `a` based on the second element of each sublist using a lambda function as the key. This means that `a` will be sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist.

Since the initial state of `a` is not explicitly defined (i.e., the contents of the sublists are not specified), we can only state that `a` will be sorted according to the second elements of its sublists. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `a` is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integers read from the input, and `a` is sorted based on the second element of each sublist.**
