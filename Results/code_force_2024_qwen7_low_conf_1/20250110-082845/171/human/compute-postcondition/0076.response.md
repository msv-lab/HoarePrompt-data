`r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from \( r + 1 \leq n \) to \( r + 2 \leq n \). The other variables remain unchanged based on the given conditions.

Output State: **\( r + 2 \leq n \), \( l \) is the index just before or at the point where \( res \leq t \), \( res \) is the value such that \( res \leq t \); `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and \( r - l + 1 \)**
