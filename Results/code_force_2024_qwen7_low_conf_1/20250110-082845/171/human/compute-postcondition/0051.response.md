To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step and consider the constraints and conditions given.

### Initial State:
- \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2000 \)
- \( a \) is a list of \( n \) sublists, each containing integers, and is sorted based on the second element of each sublist
- \( \text{ans} = 2 \)
- \( l \) is the smallest index such that \( \text{res} \leq t \)
- \( r = 3 \)
- \( \text{res} = \text{res} + a[2][0] + a[3][1] - a[2][1] \)

### Loop Code:
```python
while res > t:
    res -= a[l][0]
    if l < n - 1:
        res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]
    l += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: Initially, \( l \) is set to the smallest index such that \( \text{res} \leq t \). This means \( \text{res} \) is initially set to \( a[2][0] + a[3][1] - a[2][1] \).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as \( \text{res} > t \). Each iteration reduces \( \text{res} \) by \( a[l][0] \) and optionally by \( a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1] \) if \( l < n - 1 \).

3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when \( \text{res} \leq t \). At this point, \( \text{res} \) is adjusted to be less than or equal to \( t \).

### Final State:
- **\( l \)**: After the loop, \( l \) will be the index just beyond the last sublist that was subtracted from \( \text{res} \). If the loop terminates without reducing \( \text{res} \) below \( t \), \( l \) will be \( n \).
- **\( \text{res} \)**: Once the loop terminates, \( \text{res} \) will be exactly \( t \) because the loop ensures \( \text{res} \leq t \) at the end.

### Conclusion:
After all iterations of the loop, the values of the variables will be:
- \( l \) will be \( n \) if the loop did not terminate due to \( \text{res} \leq t \), otherwise \( l \) will be the index just beyond the last subtraction.
- \( \text{res} \) will be exactly \( t \).

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: \( l \) is \( n \) if the loop does not terminate early, otherwise \( l \) is the index just beyond the last subtraction, and \( \text{res} \) is exactly \( t \).**
