The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Given that `l` was initially the smallest index which is 2, after incrementing, `l` becomes 3. The condition in the if statement (`l < n - 1`) does not affect the value of `res` since `l` has become 3, and the condition would only be true if `l` was less than `n - 1`. Since no changes occur to `res` within the if statement due to the updated value of `l`, `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is an integer, `l` is 3, and `res` remains unchanged**.
