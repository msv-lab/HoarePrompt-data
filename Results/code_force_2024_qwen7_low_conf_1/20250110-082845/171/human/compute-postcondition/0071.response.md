`res` is initially equal to `res - a[l][0]` and is still greater than `t`. The code updates `res` by subtracting the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from `res`. So, the new value of `res` will be `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Output State: **`res` is equal to `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, which is still greater than `t`**
