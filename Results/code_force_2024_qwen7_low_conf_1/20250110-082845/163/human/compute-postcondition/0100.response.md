`aseg[l]` is incremented by 1. Since `aseg` is a list of `n + 2` elements all initially set to 0, the value of `aseg[l]` will now be 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or higher, `m` must be greater than `n-1`, `n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer, `aseg` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0 except for `aseg[l]` which is now 1, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to -1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
