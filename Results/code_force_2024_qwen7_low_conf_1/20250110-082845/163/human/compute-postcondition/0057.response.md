`l` and `r` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can represent the output state in terms of these inputs.

Output State: **`l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split**
