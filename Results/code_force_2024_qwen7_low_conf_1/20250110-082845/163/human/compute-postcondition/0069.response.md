The code snippet `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding the value of `aseg[i]` to it. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `aseg`, `i`, or any other variables. We know that `aseg[i + 1]` is updated by adding `aseg[i]` to it.

Output State: **`aseg[i + 1]` is updated to its current value plus `aseg[i]`, all other variables retain their unspecified initial values.**
