The code snippet `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding `aseg[i]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 2
- `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`
- `aseg[2]` is `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`

We need to determine the new value of `aseg[3]`.

Since `i` is 2, the line of code translates to `aseg[3] += aseg[2]`. This means `aseg[3]` will now be `aseg[2] + aseg[2]`, which simplifies to `2 * aseg[2]`.

From the initial state, `aseg[2]` is given as `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`. Therefore, `aseg[3]` becomes `2 * (aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0])`.

Substituting back, we get:
- `aseg[3]` is `2 * (aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0])`, which simplifies to `2 * aseg[2] + 4 * aseg[0]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`; `aseg[2]` is `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`; `aseg[3]` is `2 * aseg[2] + 4 * aseg[0]`; `m` is less than `n`; `n` is an integer at least 1; `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements with `along[1]` updated to `max(along[1], along[0])`; `dp` is a list of `n + 2` zeros.**
