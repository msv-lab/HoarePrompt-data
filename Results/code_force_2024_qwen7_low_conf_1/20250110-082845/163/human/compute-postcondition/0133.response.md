`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])`. Here, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. The value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the maximum of `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])`**
