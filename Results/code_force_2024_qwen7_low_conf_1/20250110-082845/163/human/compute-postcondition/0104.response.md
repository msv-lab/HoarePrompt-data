`l` and `r` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `aseg`, `along`, `l`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1 or higher, `m` must be greater than `n-1`, `n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer, `aseg[l]` is 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is -1, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to -1 except for `along[l]` which is the maximum of `r + 1` and -1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `l` and `r` are integers from `input().split()`**.
