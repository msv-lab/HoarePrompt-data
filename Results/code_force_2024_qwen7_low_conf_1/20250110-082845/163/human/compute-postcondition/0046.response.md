Output State: **`dp[1]` is `m`** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` and updates the `dp` array based on the conditions specified.
- After the loop completes, `dp[i]` is set to `m` for all `i` where `0 â‰¤ i < n + 2` if `along[i]` is not `-1`.
- The code snippet `print(dp[1])` simply prints the value of `dp[1]`.
- Based on the loop's behavior, `dp[1]` is set to `m` during the loop's iterations.
- Therefore, the output state is that `dp[1]` is `m`.
