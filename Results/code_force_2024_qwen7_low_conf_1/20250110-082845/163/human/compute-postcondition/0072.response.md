The code snippet `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding the current value of `aseg[i]` to it. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the updated value of `aseg[i + 1]` will be the sum of `aseg[i]` (which is `aseg[n - 1]`) and itself. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`aseg[i + 1]'s value is now aseg[n - 1] + aseg[n - 1]`, `along[i]'s value is the max of its current value and along[i - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, all other variables retain their unspecified initial values.**
