The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. Since the initial state of `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), these variables remain unchanged. After executing the code, `n` and `m` will hold the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user**
