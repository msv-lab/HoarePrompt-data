`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split, which converts the input into integers. The values of `along` and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `along` is a list where the value at index `l` is max(`r + 1`, original value at index `l` + 1), the value at index `r + 1` is the original value at index `r + 1` - 1, `l` and `r` are integers from the input split, `i` is `k + 1`.
