`l` and `r` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `l` and `r` will be integers derived from the input, but their specific values are not known at this point. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `aseg` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the element at index `l` is 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is 0, all other elements are 0, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `along[r + 1]` is -1, `along`[other indices] is -1, `l` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input.**
