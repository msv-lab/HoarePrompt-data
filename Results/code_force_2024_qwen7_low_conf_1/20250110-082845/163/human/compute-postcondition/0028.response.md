The code `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` increments the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by the value of `aseg[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `aseg[r + 1]` is `-m`
- `aseg[i]` is `m`
- `aseg[i + 1]` is `aseg[i + 1] + 2m`

We need to update `aseg[i + 1]` with its current value plus `aseg[i]`, which is `m`.

So, the new value of `aseg[i + 1]` will be:

\[ \text{aseg}[i + 1] = \text{aseg}[i + 1] + 2m + m = \text{aseg}[i + 1] + 3m \]

Since `aseg[i + 1]` was initially `aseg[i + 1] + 2m`, the new value becomes `aseg[i + 1] + 3m`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer; `i` is `m + 1`; `n` is an integer entered by the user; `aseg[r + 1]` is `-m`; all other elements in `aseg` are 0, except for `aseg[i]` which is `m` and `aseg[i + 1]` which is now `aseg[i + 1] + 3m`; `along[l]` is `r + 1`; `along[r + 1]` is `-1`; `along`[other indices] is `-1`; `l` and `r` are integers entered by the user; `dp` is a list of `n + 2` elements where all elements are 0; `along[m]` is `-1`.**
