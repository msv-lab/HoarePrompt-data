Postcondition: `aseg[i + 1]` is equal to the cumulative sum of the original values in the list `aseg` from index 0 to `n-1`, `along[i]` is the maximum value `along` has ever reached up to index `i`, all other variables retain their unspecified initial values, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `along[i]` is greater than or equal to 0
