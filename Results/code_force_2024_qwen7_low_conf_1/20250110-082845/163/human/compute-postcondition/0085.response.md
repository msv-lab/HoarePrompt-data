The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. However, without knowing the specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i + 1]` in the initial state, we can only state that the value of `dp[i]` is now the same as `dp[i + 1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]' is now equal to `dp[i + 1]', and the state of other variables remains unchanged.**
