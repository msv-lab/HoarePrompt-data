Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `aseg[r + 1]` is `-m`, all other elements in `aseg` are 0, except for `aseg[i]` which is `m` and `aseg[i + 1]` which is `aseg[i + 1] + nm`, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `along[r + 1]` is `-1`, `along`[other indices] is `-1`, `l` and `r` are integers, `dp` is a list of `n + 2` elements where all elements are 0. If `along[i]` is less than 0, `dp[i]` remains 0. Otherwise, `dp[n]` is set to `m`, and `dp[i]` remains 0 for all other `i`. `along[i]` remains `-1` for all `i` where `0 â‰¤ i < n + 2`.**
