The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer before assigning them to the variables `l` and `r`. The values of `m`, `i`, `n`, `aseg`, and `along` are not affected by this operation.

Since the input is read from the standard input, the exact values of `l` and `r` depend on what the user inputs. However, we can describe the output state in terms of these inputs.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `aseg` is a list of `n + 2` elements all set to 0, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements all set to -1, `l` is an integer entered by the user, `r` is an integer entered by the user.**
