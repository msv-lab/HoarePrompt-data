The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them into integers before assigning them to `n` and `m`. Given the initial state where `dp[1]` is `m` and the input value is 2, let's assume the user inputs "2 3" (since the input value is mentioned as 2, we can infer that the second number could be anything, but we'll use 3 for demonstration purposes).

- Initially, `dp[1]` is `m`.
- After the code runs, `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, which is 2.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input, which is 3.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[1]` is 3, `n` is 2, `m` is 3.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 3, `n` is 2, `m` is 3**
