Output State: **`dp[1]` is 3, `n` is 2, `m` is 3, `aseg` is a list where each index `i` has its value as `-seg[i] + original_aseg[i]`, where `original_aseg[i]` is the initial value of `aseg[i]` (which is 0 for all indices except the last one which starts as -1), `along` is a list where each index `i` has its value as the maximum value it has ever reached during the loop executions, starting from the initial value -1.**
