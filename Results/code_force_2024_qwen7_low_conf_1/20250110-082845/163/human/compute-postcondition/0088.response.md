Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `dp[i]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`.
   - If `along[i]` is less than 0, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.
   - The states of the other variables (`aseg` and `along`) remain unchanged.

2. **Identify the loop range and condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0 (since the loop stops at `i = 1`).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- **Current state:**
  - `dp[i]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`.
  - If `along[i]` is less than 0, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.
  - Other variables (`aseg` and `along`) remain unchanged.

- **Next iteration:**
  - `i` will be `i - 1`.
  - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the valid range, i.e., `i > 0`.

Therefore, we need to update the state such that `i` is now `i - 1` and ensure that `i` is still greater than 0.

**State:**
- `dp[i]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`.
- If `along[i]` is less than 0, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.
- The states of the other variables (`aseg` and `along`) remain unchanged.
- `i` is now `i - 1`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`dp[i]` is the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]`, if `along[i]` is less than 0, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `i` must be greater than 0. The states of the other variables (`aseg` and `along`) remain unchanged.**
