State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is now equal to `n`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop iterates over a range defined by `range(n, 0, -1)`.
2. For the loop to start executing, the range function must generate valid values for `i`.
3. The range function generates values from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
4. To ensure the loop starts, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the range will not produce any values, and the loop will not execute.
5. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be set to `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to `n`.
