The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to `n-1`, and `n` must be at least 1.

Let's go through the steps:

1. `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input, which must be two integers separated by whitespace.
2. The value of `i` is initially `n-1`, and this does not change because the code only assigns values to `n` and `m`.

Since the input values for `n` and `m` are not specified, we can only say that they are integers. However, the initial condition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer**
