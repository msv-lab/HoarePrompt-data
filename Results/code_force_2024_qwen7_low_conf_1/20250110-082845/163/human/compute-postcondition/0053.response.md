`aseg[l]` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is an input integer, so the exact value of `aseg[l]` is unknown until `l` is specified. However, we know that `aseg[l]` will be the original value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[1]` is 3, `n` is 2, `m` is 3, `aseg` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `along` is [-1, -1, -1, -1], `i` must be in the range [0, 2], `aseg[l]` is 1 more than its original value (which was 0), `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
