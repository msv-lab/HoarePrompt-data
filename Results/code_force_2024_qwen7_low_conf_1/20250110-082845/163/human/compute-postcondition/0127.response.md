The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, this assignment changes the value of `dp[i]` to the value of `dp[n + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is now equal to `n`, the current value of `along[i]` is less than 0, and `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[n + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is now equal to `n`, the current value of `along[i]` is less than 0, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[n + 1]`**
