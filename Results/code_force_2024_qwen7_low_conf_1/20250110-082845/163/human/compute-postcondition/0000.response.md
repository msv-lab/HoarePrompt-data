Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**:
   - The loop is driven by the input from `input()` function, specifically `int(input())`.
   - This input is stored in the variable `_`, which is used as the loop counter.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is based on the input value, which is expected to be an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute, this integer must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

3. **Determine Initial State Adjustments**:
   - Since the input value (stored in `_`) drives the loop, we need to ensure that the initial value of `_` is within the specified range.
   - Additionally, since the loop runs `t` times, the value of `_` should start from 1 up to `t`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- The variable `_` should be initialized to 1 (the first iteration) and it should be less than or equal to `t`.
- The value of `t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state adjustment needed is:

**State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
