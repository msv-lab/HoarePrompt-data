The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to the value of `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `dp` is a list of `n + 2` elements where all elements are 0, and `dp[n]` is set to `m` if `along[n]` is not less than 0. Since `dp[n]` was set to `m` and `dp` remains unchanged otherwise, the current value of `dp[n]` is `m`.

Since `i` is `n - 1` at the start of this iteration, `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[n]`, which is `m`. Therefore, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) is updated to `m`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `aseg[r + 1]` is `-m`, all other elements in `aseg` are 0, except for `aseg[i]` which is `m` and `aseg[i + 1]` which is `aseg[i + 1] + nm`, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `along[r + 1]` is `-1`, `along`[other indices] is `-1`, `l` and `r` are integers, `dp` is a list of `n + 2` elements where all elements are 0, `dp[n - 1]` is `m`.**
