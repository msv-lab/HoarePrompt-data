`aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1. The value at index `l` in `aseg` was previously incremented by 1. The value of `l` and `r` are integers from the input split. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the updated state is:

- The value at index `l` in `aseg` is now the original value plus 1.
- The value at index `r + 1` in `aseg` is now the original value minus 1.

Output State: **`aseg` is a list where the value at index `l` is the original value plus 1, the value at index `r + 1` is the original value minus 1, `l` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split**
