`l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers inputted by the user, converted using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `l` and `r` now hold the specific values provided by the user, while other variables retain their original values or conditions. 

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than `n-1`, `n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer, `aseg[l]` is 2, `aseg[r + 1]` is -2, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to -1 except for `along[l]` which is the maximum of `r + 1` and -1, `l` is the input integer from the user, `r` is the input integer from the user**
