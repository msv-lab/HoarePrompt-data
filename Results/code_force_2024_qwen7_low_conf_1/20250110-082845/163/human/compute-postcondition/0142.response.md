The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. Instead, it seems to handle a series of test cases based on predefined constraints. The constraints provided indicate that for each test case, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). Additionally, each of the next `m` lines contains two integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) such that \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\).

Given the output description provided in the example, it suggests there are different return cases based on the input values, but since the function definition itself does not take any parameters, we need to infer the parameters from the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and processes `m` pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). The function returns results based on the input values as specified in the output cases.**
