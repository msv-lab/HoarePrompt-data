`aseg[i + 1]` is assigned the value of `aseg[i + 1] + aseg[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `aseg[2]` is assigned the value of `aseg[2] + aseg[1]`. Since `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`, we substitute this into the equation.

The updated value of `aseg[2]` is `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1; `m` is less than `n`; `n` is an integer at least 1; `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`; `aseg[2]` is `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`; `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements; `dp` is a list of `n + 2` zeros.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `m` is less than `n`; `n` is an integer at least 1; `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`; `aseg[2]` is `aseg[2] + 2 * aseg[0]`; `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements; `dp` is a list of `n + 2` zeros.**
