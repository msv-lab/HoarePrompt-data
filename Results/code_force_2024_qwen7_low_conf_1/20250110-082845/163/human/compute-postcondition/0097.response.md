The code creates a new list `along` with `n + 2` elements, all set to `-1`. This affects the variable `along` and leaves the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer at least 1, `m` is an integer, `aseg` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to 0, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, all set to -1**
