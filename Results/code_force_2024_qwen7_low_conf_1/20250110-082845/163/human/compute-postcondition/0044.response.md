Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `aseg[r + 1]` is `-m`, all other elements in `aseg` are 0, `aseg[i]` is `m`, `aseg[i + 1]` is `aseg[i + 1] + nm`, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `along[r + 1]` is `-1`, `along`[other indices] is `-1`, `l` and `r` are integers, `dp` is a list of `n + 2` elements where all elements are 0, and `dp[n - 1]` is `m` if `along[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `dp[n - 1]` is `m`; `dp[n - 2]` is `m` if `along[i]` is less than 0, otherwise `dp[n - 2]` is unchanged, and `dp[i]` is `m` regardless of the condition.***
