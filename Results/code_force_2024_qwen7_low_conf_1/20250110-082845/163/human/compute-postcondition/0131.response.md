Let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( n \) must be greater than 0.
- \( i \) is now equal to \( n \).
- If \( along[i] \) is less than 0, then \( dp[i] \) is equal to \( dp[n + 1] \).
- Otherwise, \( dp[i] \) is updated to the maximum of \( dp[n + 1] \) and \( aseg[n] + dp[along[n]] \).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from \( n \) down to 1 (exclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
2. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is equal to \( n \).

### Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:

- Since the loop is iterating in reverse (from \( n \) to 1), the next value of \( i \) will be \( i - 1 \).
- Given that the initial value of \( i \) is \( n \), the next value of \( i \) will be \( n - 1 \).

### Updated States:
- \( n \) remains unchanged since it is an upper bound of the range.
- \( i \) is decremented by 1, so \( i \) will be \( n - 1 \).
- No other variables are explicitly modified within the loop body based on the provided information.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- \( n \) must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- \( i \) is \( n - 1 \).

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is \( n - 1 \)**.
