Postcondition: ***`aseg[i + 1]` is equal to the cumulative sum of the original values in the list `aseg` from index 0 to `n-1`, `along[i]` is the maximum value `along` has ever reached up to index `i`, `dp[i]` is `dp[i + 1]` if `along[i] < 0`, otherwise `dp[n - 1]` is assigned the value `max(0, aseg[n - 1] + dp[along[n - 1]])`, all other variables retain their unspecified initial values, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0.***
