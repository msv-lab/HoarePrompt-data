Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dp[1]` is the maximum value obtained by the dynamic programming process defined by the loop, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of the original values in the list `aseg` from index 0 to `n-1`, `along[i]` is the maximum value `along` has ever reached up to index `i`, all other variables retain their unchanged final values after the loop completes.**
