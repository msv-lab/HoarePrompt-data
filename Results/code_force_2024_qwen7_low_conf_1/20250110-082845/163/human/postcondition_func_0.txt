The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `m` pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). It then performs a series of operations to compute a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum value of a certain subarray configuration. Specifically, it calculates a cumulative sum array `aseg` and a maximum reach array `along`. After these computations, it determines the maximum value `dp[1]` based on the values in `aseg` and `along`. Finally, the function prints the result `dp[1]` for each test case.
