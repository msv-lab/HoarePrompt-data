You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a fun game where you need to feed cats that come and go. The level of
the game consists of n steps. There are m cats; the cat i is present in steps
from l_i to r_i , inclusive. In each step, you can feed all the cats that are
currently present or do nothing.

If you feed the same cat more than once, it will overeat, and you will
immediately lose the game. Your goal is to feed as many cats as possible
without causing any cat to overeat.

Find the maximum number of cats you can feed.

Formally, you need to select several integer points from the segment from 1 to
n in such a way that among given segments, none covers two or more of the
selected points, and as many segments as possible cover one of the selected
points.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le
10^6 , 1 \le m\le 2\cdot 10^5 ).

The i -th of the next m lines contains a pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 \le
l_i \le r_i \le n ).

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^6 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum number of cats you can
feed.

Note

In the first example, one of the ways to feed five cats is to feed at steps 4
and 11 .

  * At step 4 , cats 1 , 2 , and 3 will be fed.
  * At step 11 , cats 5 and 6 will be fed.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each line of the next m lines contains two integers l_i and r_i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        aseg = [0] * (n + 2)
        
        along = [-1] * (n + 2)
        
        for i in range(m):
            l, r = map(int, input().split())
            aseg[l] += 1
            aseg[r + 1] -= 1
            along[l] = max(r + 1, along[l])
        
        dp = [0] * (n + 2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]
            along[i] = max(along[i], along[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            if along[i] < 0:
                dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
            else:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])
        
        print(dp[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dp[1]` is the maximum value obtained by the dynamic programming process defined by the loop, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of the original values in the list `aseg` from index 0 to `n-1`, `along[i]` is the maximum value `along` has ever reached up to index `i`, all other variables retain their unchanged final values after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `m` pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). It then performs a series of operations to compute a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum value of a certain subarray configuration. Specifically, it calculates a cumulative sum array `aseg` and a maximum reach array `along`. After these computations, it determines the maximum value `dp[1]` based on the values in `aseg` and `along`. Finally, the function prints the result `dp[1]` for each test case.
