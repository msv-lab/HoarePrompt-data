Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Test Cases Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, which are the number of steps and the number of cats, respectively. This matches the problem description where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`, and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5`.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - It then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)` representing the range of steps where each cat is present. This is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It initializes an array `aseg` to keep track of the cumulative counts of cats present at each step and another array `along` to store the farthest step where a cat is still available for feeding without overeating.

4. **Counting Cats and Storing Farthest Step**:
   - For each cat's range `(l_i, r_i)`, it updates the `aseg` array to increment the count at `l_i` and decrement the count at `r_i + 1`. It also updates the `along` array to store the farthest step `r_i + 1` for the current `l_i`.

5. **Cumulative Count Calculation**:
   - It then iterates through the `aseg` array to compute the cumulative count of cats at each step.

6. **Dynamic Programming for Maximum Feeding**:
   - The program uses a second dynamic programming array `dp` to find the maximum number of cats that can be fed. It ensures that no cat is fed more than once by using the `along` array to avoid overlapping ranges.

7. **Result Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of cats that can be fed.

### Why it is Correct:
- **Correct Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and processes the input as specified.
- **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The use of dynamic programming to ensure no cat is fed more than once and to maximize the number of cats fed is correctly implemented.
- **Edge Cases**: Although the problem description assumes valid input, the program correctly handles the logical steps required to solve the problem without additional error handling beyond ensuring inputs are processed as expected.

Thus, the program accurately follows the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
