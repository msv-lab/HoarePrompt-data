You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a fun game where you need to feed cats that come and go. The level of
the game consists of n steps. There are m cats; the cat i is present in steps
from l_i to r_i , inclusive. In each step, you can feed all the cats that are
currently present or do nothing.

If you feed the same cat more than once, it will overeat, and you will
immediately lose the game. Your goal is to feed as many cats as possible
without causing any cat to overeat.

Find the maximum number of cats you can feed.

Formally, you need to select several integer points from the segment from 1 to
n in such a way that among given segments, none covers two or more of the
selected points, and as many segments as possible cover one of the selected
points.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le
10^6 , 1 \le m\le 2\cdot 10^5 ).

The i -th of the next m lines contains a pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 \le
l_i \le r_i \le n ).

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^6 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum number of cats you can
feed.

Note

In the first example, one of the ways to feed five cats is to feed at steps 4
and 11 .

  * At step 4 , cats 1 , 2 , and 3 will be fed.
  * At step 11 , cats 5 and 6 will be fed.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `dp[1]` is the maximum value obtained by the dynamic programming process defined by the loop, `aseg[i + 1]` is the cumulative sum of the original values in the list `aseg` from index 0 to `n-1`, `along[i]` is the maximum value `along` has ever reached up to index `i`, all other variables retain their unchanged final values after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes integers `n` and `m` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `m` pairs of integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) where \(1 \leq l_i \leq r_i \leq n\). It then performs a series of operations to compute a dynamic programming solution to find the maximum value of a certain subarray configuration. Specifically, it calculates a cumulative sum array `aseg` and a maximum reach array `along`. After these computations, it determines the maximum value `dp[1]` based on the values in `aseg` and `along`. Finally, the function prints the result `dp[1]` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python function `func()` attempts to solve the problem by using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `aseg` is an array used to accumulate the number of cats present at each step.
   - `along` is an array used to store the rightmost step where a cat can still be fed without overeating after step `i`.

2. **Processing Cats' Intervals**:
   - For each interval `(l, r)`, the code updates `aseg[l]` to increment the count of cats starting at step `l`.
   - It also updates `aseg[r + 1]` to decrement the count, indicating that no new cats start at step `r + 1`.
   - The `along` array is updated to keep track of the latest possible step where a cat starting at `l` can still be fed without overeating.

3. **Accumulating Cat Counts**:
   - The `aseg` array is accumulated to get the total number of cats present up to each step.
   - The `along` array is adjusted to ensure it always holds the maximum possible step where a cat starting at the current step can still be fed.

4. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of cats that can be fed up to step `i`.
   - The DP table is filled from right to left, ensuring that each entry `dp[i]` considers the best option between skipping the current step or feeding the cats present at that step.

5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained from `dp[1]`, which gives the maximum number of cats that can be fed starting from step 1.

### Correctness:

Given the logic described, the function seems to correctly implement a greedy and dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. Each step of the process ensures that no cat is fed more than once while maximizing the number of cats fed.

- The use of `aseg` to accumulate the number of cats present up to each step is correct.
- The `along` array helps in determining the last valid step for each cat to avoid overfeeding.
- The dynamic programming table `dp` correctly computes the maximum number of cats that can be fed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above reasoning, the provided function appears to be correct in solving the problem as stated.

**Correctness: True**
