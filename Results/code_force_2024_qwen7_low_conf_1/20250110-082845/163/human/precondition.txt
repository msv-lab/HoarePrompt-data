t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each segment l_i to r_i satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
