You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: There is a rectangular sheet of paper with initial height n and width m . Let
the current height and width be h and w respectively. We introduce a xy
-coordinate system so that the four corners of the sheet are (0, 0), (w, 0),
(0, h) , and (w, h) . The sheet can then be cut along the lines x =
1,2,\ldots,w-1 and the lines y = 1,2,\ldots,h-1 . In each step, the paper is
cut randomly along any one of these h+w-2 lines. After each vertical and
horizontal cut, the right and bottom piece of paper respectively are
discarded.

Find the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of
paper strictly less than k . It can be shown that this answer can always be
expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime integers.
Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 57000 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m , and k (1 \le n, m
\le 10^6 , 2 \le k \le 10^{12} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not
exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer â€” the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 4 10
    
    2 4 8
    
    2 4 2
    
    2 4 6

Output

    0
    1
    833333342
    250000003
    
Note

For the first test case, the area is already less than 10 so no cuts are
required.

For the second test case, the area is exactly 8 so any one of the 4 possible
cuts would make the area strictly less than 8 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{17}{6} = 833\,333\,342\bmod
(10^9+7) .

For the fourth test case, the final answer is \frac{5}{4} = 250\,000\,003\bmod
(10^9+7) .
Program:
```
def func_2(n, m, k, steps):
    import math
    (h, w) = (n, m)
    for _ in range(steps):
        if h > w:
            h = max(h // 2, 1)
        else:
            w = max(w // 2, 1)
        if h * w < k:
            return True
    return h * w < k
```
