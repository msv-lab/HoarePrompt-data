The code `q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` calculates the modular inverse of `q` with respect to `MOD`. Given the initial state, we know that `q` is equal to `1`. The modular inverse of `1` modulo any number `MOD` is `1` because \(1^{-1} \equiv 1 \mod \text{any number}\).

Therefore, `q_inv` will be assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1**
