According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps`. For the loop to execute again, `steps` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `steps` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than `w`, and `w` is greater than or equal to `k / h`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `steps` must still be greater than 0. Since `steps` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain greater than 0 unless explicitly changed within the loop body (which is omitted).

The other conditions (`h > w` and `w >= k / h`) do not change based on the loop iteration itself.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`steps` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than `w`, and `w` is greater than or equal to `k / h`**
