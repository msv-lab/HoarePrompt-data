Output State: **`steps` is a non-negative integer, `h` is either the result of repeatedly applying `h //= 2` until `h <= w` and then setting it to `max(h, 1)`, or remains the original value `n` if the loop does not execute, and `w` is either the result of repeatedly applying `w //= 2` until `w >= h` and then setting it to `max(w, 1)`, or remains the original value `m` if the loop does not execute, and if `h * w < k`, the function returns True, otherwise it returns nothing.**
