The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `n` and retains the original values of the other variables.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.**
