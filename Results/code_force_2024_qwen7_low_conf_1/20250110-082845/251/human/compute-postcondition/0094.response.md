To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `low` is greater than `max(n, m) - 1`.
- `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`.
- `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\).
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then `answer` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\).
- Otherwise, `low` is set to \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1\), and `high` remains as \(2 \times \text{max}(n, m)\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

### Analysis:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be true at the start of the next iteration.

1. **Current State**:
   - `low > max(n, m) - 1`
   - `high = 2 * max(n, m)`
   - `mid = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor`

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue if `low <= high`.

3. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, `answer` is updated to `mid`, but this does not affect the values of `low` and `high`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is false, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, and `high` remains `2 * max(n, m)`.

4. **Ensuring `low <= high`**:
   - For `low <= high` to hold true in the next iteration:
     - `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

5. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - Since `high` is fixed at `2 * max(n, m)`, we need to ensure that `low` is less than or equal to `2 * max(n, m)`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is false, `low` becomes `mid + 1`, where `mid = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor`. Therefore, `low` would be:
     \[
     \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - For the loop to execute one more time, this new value of `low` must be less than or equal to `2 * max(n, m)`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `2 * max(n, m)` is the upper bound for `high`, and `low` is being incremented by 1 when the condition fails, `low` will always be less than or equal to `2 * max(n, m)` unless `mid` is very large, which is not the case here since `mid` is a fixed value derived from `max(n, m)`.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can continue, which means ensuring that the updated value of `low` (if the condition fails) still satisfies the loop condition `low <= high`.

**State**: **`low` is greater than `max(n, m) - 1`, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\), and `low` must be less than or equal to `2 * max(n, m)`**.
