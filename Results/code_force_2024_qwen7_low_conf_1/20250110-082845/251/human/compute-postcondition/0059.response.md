The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be one more than the current value of `mid`. From the initial state, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`. Therefore, `low` will be updated to `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is `0`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by `3`.
