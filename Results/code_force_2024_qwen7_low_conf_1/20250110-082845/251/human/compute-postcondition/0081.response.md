`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, the value of `mid` will be `0 + 2 * max(n, m) // 2`, which simplifies to `max(n, m)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is 0, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`.

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `max(n, m)`**
