Output State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable, and all elements of `results` have been printed.** 

### Explanation:
- **Non-empty Iterable:** The loop runs as long as there are elements in `results`. Therefore, `results` must be a non-empty iterable to start with.
- **All Elements Printed:** Each iteration of the loop prints an element from `results`. Since the loop continues until there are no more elements to print, by the end of the loop, every element in `results` will have been printed.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `results` is an empty iterable), then no elements are printed. However, since the initial state specifies that the loop must execute at least once, we know that `results` must be non-empty. Thus, all elements of `results` will have been printed by the time the loop completes.
