Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). For each test case, it performs a binary search to find the minimum integer \(p\) such that the product of \(p\) and \(q\) (where \(q\) is calculated as \(1\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\)) is greater than or equal to \(k\). The function then calculates \(p \times q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) and stores the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If \(n\) or \(m\) is zero, the function should handle these cases appropriately since the initial conditions assume \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^6\).
- If \(k\) is less than or equal to \(0\), the function should handle these cases as well, although the problem constraints specify \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), so this scenario is unlikely.
- The binary search is set up to search within the range \([0, \max(n, m) \times 20]\), which might not cover all possible values of \(p\) for very large \(n\) and \(m\). However, given the constraints, this range is likely sufficient.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where \(n\) or \(m\) is equal to zero, which could lead to undefined behavior in the calculation of \(p\). This should be addressed to ensure robustness.

**Final State:**
After the function concludes, the program will have processed all test cases, stored the results of the calculations for each test case, and printed these results. The `results` list will be empty before the for loop, and after the loop, it will contain the calculated results for each test case, which are then printed.
