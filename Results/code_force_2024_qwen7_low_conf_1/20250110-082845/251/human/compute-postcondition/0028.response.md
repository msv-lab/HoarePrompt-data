Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `while low <= high`.
- After the previous iteration:
  - `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\)
  - `low` remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\)
  - `high` is \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\) or remains unchanged
  - `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\)
  - `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` has evaluated to `True` or `False`

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

2. **Adjusting `low` and `high`**:
   - `low` either remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\).
   - `high` either remains unchanged or updates to \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\).

3. **Determining the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true.
   - If `low` was updated to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) in the previous iteration, then `low` will be greater than `high` unless `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True` and `low` is updated back.
   - If `high` was updated to \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\), then `high` will be less than `low` unless `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False` and `high` is updated back.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Continues**:
   - For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `low` is not greater than `high` after the previous iteration.
   - This means we need to ensure that either `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returned `True` and `low` was updated back, or `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returned `False` and `high` was updated back.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can continue, we need to adjust the state such that `low` is not greater than `high`. Given that `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` has evaluated to `True` or `False`, we need to make sure that the correct update happened based on the function's return value.

### Final Answer
State: **`mid` is \((low + high) // 2\), `low` remains unchanged or updates to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), `high` is \(((low + high) // 2) - 1\) or remains unchanged, `answer` is \((low + high) // 2\), and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` has evaluated to `True` or `False` ensuring that `low` is not greater than `high`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `low <= high` is satisfied for the next iteration.
