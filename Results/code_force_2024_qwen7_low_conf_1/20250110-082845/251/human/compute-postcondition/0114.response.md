The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns an integer value based on the constraints provided. The constraints are that `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that `1 <= t <= 57000`, `1 <= n, m <= 10^6`, and `2 <= k <= 10^12`. Additionally, the value of `n * m` must be greater than or equal to `k` after each cut, and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value based on the given constraints.**
