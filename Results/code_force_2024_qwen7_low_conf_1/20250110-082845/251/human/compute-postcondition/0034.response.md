Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`. The initial value of `t` must be greater than 0, `data[0]` is a positive integer, `n` is the initial value of `data[idx]`, `m` is the initial value of `data[idx + 1]`, and `k` is the initial value of `data[idx + 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.
- Each iteration updates `mid`, checks `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, and adjusts `low` or `high` accordingly.
- Since `low` and `high` are adjusted in such a way that they eventually converge, the loop will terminate when `low` equals `high`.
- At this point, `mid` will also be equal to `low` and `high`, and `answer` will hold the value of `mid`.
- The condition `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` must evaluate to `True` for the loop to terminate with the specified values.
