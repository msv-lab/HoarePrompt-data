`q` is assigned the value `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `q` and retains the values of the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is 0 % MOD, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, `q` is 1.**
