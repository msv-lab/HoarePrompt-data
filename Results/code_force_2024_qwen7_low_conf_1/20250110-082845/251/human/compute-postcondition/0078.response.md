Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 2 * max(`n`, `m`), `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` now contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD), answer % MOD]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is the original value of `idx` plus 3, `q` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[idx - 3])`, `m` is `int(data[idx - 2])**
