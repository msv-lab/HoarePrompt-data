`p` is assigned the value of `answer`, which is equal to `low` (and thus `high`) and `mid`. The value of `answer` remains unchanged, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`)**
