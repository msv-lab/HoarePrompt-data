The code assigns the value of `mid` to `answer`. Since `mid` is defined as \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\), `answer` will take on this value. The values of `low`, `high`, and `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is greater than `max(n, m) - 1`; `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`; `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\); `answer` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\).

Output State: **`low` is greater than `max(n, m) - 1`; `high` is `2 * max(n, m)`; `mid` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\); `answer` is equal to \(\left\lfloor \frac{3 \times \text{max}(n, m)}{2} \right\rfloor\)**
