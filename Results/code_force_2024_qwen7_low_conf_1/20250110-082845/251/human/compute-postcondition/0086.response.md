`low` is initially set to `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `max(n, m)`, we substitute `mid` with `max(n, m)`. Therefore, `low` is now set to `max(n, m) + 1`. The values of `high` and `mid` remain unchanged, and the function call `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` remains False.

Output State: **`low` is `max(n, m) + 1`, `high` is 2 * max(n, m), `mid` is max(n, m), and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is False**
