The code snippet `m = int(data[idx + 1])` assigns the value of `int(data[idx + 1])` to the variable `m`. Given the initial state, `idx` is not defined, but we know that `data[idx]` is an integer value assigned to `n`, and `data[idx + 1]` should also be an integer value from the list `data`.

Since the exact value of `data[idx + 1]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we know that `m` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`**
