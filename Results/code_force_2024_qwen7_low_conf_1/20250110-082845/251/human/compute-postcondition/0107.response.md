State before the loop starts:

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty iterable (such as a list, tuple, or any other iterable object that contains at least one element).

The initial state given is only about the `total`, which does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `results` is a non-empty iterable.

State: **`results` must be a non-empty iterable**
