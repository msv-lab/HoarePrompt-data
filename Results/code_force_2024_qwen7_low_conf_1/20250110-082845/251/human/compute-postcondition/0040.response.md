According to the code, the loop runs for a specified number of times `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `low` is equal to `high`
- `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`)
- `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`)
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`)
- `q_inv` is `1`
- `result` is `low % MOD`
- `results` contains `[low % MOD]`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to update the state according to the loop's condition and the given information.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs for `t` iterations. If it has already completed `t-1` iterations, it will run for the `t`th iteration.
2. Since the loop variable `_` is a placeholder, it does not affect the state directly. The loop will continue if the condition `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true.
3. Given that `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, the loop can execute again.
4. After each iteration, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `answer`, `p`, and `q_inv` should remain the same as they did at the end of the previous iteration.
5. The `result` and `results` should be updated based on the current value of `low`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `low` remains the same
- `high` remains the same
- `mid` remains the same
- `answer` remains the same
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` remains `True`
- `p` remains the same
- `q_inv` remains `1`
- `result` is updated to `low % MOD`
- `results` contains the previous result plus the new result `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`

State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`**
