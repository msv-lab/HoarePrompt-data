The code appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This means that the value of `result` (which is `answer % MOD`) is added to the list. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` > `high`, `answer` is the last valid `mid` (if any), `p` = `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` reflects the result of the last iteration, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is now a list containing `[result]`**
