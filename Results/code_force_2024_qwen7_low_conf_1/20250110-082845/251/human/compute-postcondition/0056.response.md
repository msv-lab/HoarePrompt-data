The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the new value of `mid` as the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high`. Given the initial conditions:

- `low` is `0` or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`
- `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`
- `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`
- `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `p` is `0`
- `q_inv` is `1`
- `result` is `0 % MOD`
- `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by `3`

We need to consider two cases for `low`:

1. If `low` is `0`, then `mid = (0 + high) // 2 = high // 2`.
2. If `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, then `mid = ((max(n, m) * 10 + 1) + high) // 2`.

However, since `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, in both cases, the calculation will effectively make `mid` closer to `high` without affecting the condition that `mid` was previously `max(n, m) * 10`. Therefore, `mid` remains `max(n, m) * 10`.

Output State: **`low` is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is `0`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by `3`.
