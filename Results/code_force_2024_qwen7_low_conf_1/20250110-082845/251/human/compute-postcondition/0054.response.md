Postcondition: ***`low`, `high`, `mid`, `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, `p`, `q_inv`, `result`, `results`, `k`, and `idx` retain their values as follows: if `(func_2(n, m, k, mid))` is true, then `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by 3. Otherwise, `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by 3.***
