Postcondition: ***`steps` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than `w`, and `w` is greater than or equal to `k / h`. If `h * w < k`, the function returns True. Otherwise, the values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions: if `h > w`, then `h` is set to `h // 2`; otherwise, `w` is set to the maximum of `w // 2` and 1.***
