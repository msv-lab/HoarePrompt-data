The code calculates the modular inverse of `q` using the formula `q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`. Given that `q` is 1, we need to compute the modular inverse of 1 modulo `MOD`.

Since the modular inverse of 1 modulo any number `MOD` is 1 itself, the value of `q_inv` will be 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`low` > `high`, `answer` is the last valid `mid` (if any), `p` = `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` reflects the result of the last iteration, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1**
