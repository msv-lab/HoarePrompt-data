The code `print(res)` prints the first element of the `results` iterable since `results` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining element. However, the actual value of `res` is not assigned anywhere in the given code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The output of the print statement will be the first element of `results`, but the value of `results` itself does not change.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty iterable with at least one remaining element; the first element of `results` is printed.**
