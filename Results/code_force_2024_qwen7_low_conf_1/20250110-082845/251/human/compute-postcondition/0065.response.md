The variable `low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is initially `(max(n, m) * 10 + 1) // 2`, the new value of `low` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is `(max(n, m) * 10 + 1) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `mid` is `(max(n, m) * 10 + 1) // 2`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is `0`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by `3`.
