State before the loop starts: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `k` is a positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^12; `steps` is a non-negative integer; `h` is equal to `n`; `w` is equal to `m`.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to consider the condition under which the loop will run. The loop will run as long as `steps` is greater than 0.

Given this, the key variables here are `steps` and `h` (which is initialized to `n`) and `w` (which is initialized to `m`). However, since the loop itself does not directly modify `h` or `w`, we only need to focus on `steps`.

- `steps` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`steps` must be greater than 0**
