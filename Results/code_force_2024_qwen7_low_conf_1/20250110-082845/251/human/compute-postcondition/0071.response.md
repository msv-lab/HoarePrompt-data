The code `result = p * q_inv % MOD` assigns the value of `p * q_inv % MOD` to the variable `result`. Given the initial state:

- `low` is 0
- `high` is 0
- `mid` is 0
- `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`
- `p` is `answer`
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is 0 % MOD
- `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by 3
- `q` is 1

The value of `result` is updated to `p * q_inv % MOD`. Since `p` is `answer` and `q_inv` is 1, the calculation simplifies to `answer * 1 % MOD`, which is just `answer % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, `q` is 1.**
