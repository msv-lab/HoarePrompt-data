The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 2]` to `k`, which is an integer conversion. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `k`.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `high`, `mid` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `answer` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is equal to `low` (and thus `high`), `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `low % MOD`, `results` contains `[low % MOD, (low % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`**
