Let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions:
- The loop condition is `while low <= high`.
- The initial values at the end of the previous iteration are:
  - `low` is 0 if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, otherwise `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.
  - `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1` if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, otherwise `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`.
  - `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`.
  - `answer` is set to `max(n, m) * 10` if `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, otherwise `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`.
  - `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`.
  - `p` is 0.
  - `q_inv` is 1.
  - `result` is `0 % MOD`.
  - `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`.
  - `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`.
  - `idx` is increased by 3.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `low` is either 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.
   - `high` is either `max(n, m) * 10 - 1` or `max(n, m) * 20`.

For the loop to continue:
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

Given the current values:
- If `low` is 0, then `high` must be greater than or equal to 0, which is always true because `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 - 1` (which is positive).
- If `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, then `high` must be greater than or equal to `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

Since `max(n, m) * 10 - 1` is always less than `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `high` is adjusted to be at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`low` is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` must be at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by 3**
