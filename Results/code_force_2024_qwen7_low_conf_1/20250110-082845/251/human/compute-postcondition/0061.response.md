Let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `low` is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`
- `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`
- `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`
- `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `p` is `0`
- `q_inv` is `1`
- `result` is `0 % MOD`
- `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by `3`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while low <= high:
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

2. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
   - From the given information, we know that initially, `low` could be either `0` or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, and `high` is at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.
   - The only way for `low` to change within the loop is through the condition `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`. If `func_2` evaluates to `True`, `high` becomes `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`. Otherwise, `low` becomes `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

Since `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True` at the end of the previous iteration, `high` has been adjusted to `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`. This means that the current value of `low` (which is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`) will no longer satisfy the condition `low <= high` because `low` is greater than `high`.

To allow the loop to continue, we need to adjust `high` back to a value such that `low <= high` holds true. Since the initial value of `high` was at least `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, we need to set `high` back to `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `high` should be set to `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low` is 0 or `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` must be `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10` or `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is `0`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, and `idx` is increased by `3`.
