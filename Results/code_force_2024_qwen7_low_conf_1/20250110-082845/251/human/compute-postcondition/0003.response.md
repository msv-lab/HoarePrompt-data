The code sets `h` to the maximum of `h // 2` and 1. Since `h` is initially greater than `w` and both are positive (as `steps` must be greater than 0, which implies `w` is positive), `h` is at least 1. Dividing `h` by 2 and taking the maximum with 1 will not change the value of `h` if `h` is 2 or more. Therefore, the value of `h` remains the same, and `w` is still greater than `h`.

Output State: **`steps` must be greater than 0, `h` is greater than `w`.**
