The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `low` is 0
- `high` is 0
- `mid` is 0
- `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`
- `p` is `answer`
- `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`
- `q_inv` is 1
- `result` is `answer % MOD`
- `results` now contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD), answer % MOD]`
- `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`
- `idx` is increased by 3
- `q` is 1
- `t` must be greater than 0

The Output State is: **`low` is 0, `high` is 0, `mid` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value for which `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, `p` is `answer`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` now contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD), answer % MOD]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, `q` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(data[idx])`.
