The code assigns the value of `n` to `h` and the value of `m` to `w`. The variables `k` and `steps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^12, and `steps` is a non-negative integer; `h` is equal to `n`; `w` is equal to `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^6; `k` is a positive integer such that 2 <= k <= 10^12; `steps` is a non-negative integer; `h` is equal to `n`; `w` is equal to `m`**
