The code `low = mid + 1` changes the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, so the new value of `low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`low` is `max(n, m) * 10 + 1`, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to `True`, `p` is 0, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `0 % MOD`, `results` contains `[0 % MOD, (0 % MOD)]`, `k` is equal to `int(data[idx + 2])`, `idx` is increased by 3, `(func_2(n, m, k, mid))` is `False`**
